<p><strong>What Matters the Most</strong></p>
<p>Let me begin this morning by asking each of you a question: What matters the most to you? There are many things in life that are important to us and that matter, but determining and identifying what matters the most and then striving towards achieving that goal will dramatically affect every decision you make and everything you do in life. A few weeks ago, I was with a bishop in our stake visiting some of his ward members. We visited a family with three teenaged daughters, and during the visit, I asked each of the girls this same question: “What matters the most to you?” The youngest girl, who is 14, immediately answered, “My family,” her two older sisters both said that church was what mattered the most, and the father responded with family and serving others. These were wonderful responses. I then turned to the bishop and asked him, “Bishop, in your life, what matters the most to you.” He reflected for a moment, and then, with his eyes beginning to moisten with tears, he said, “What matters the most to me is my relationship with my Heavenly Father and in doing His will.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, I hope that as you pondered the question of “What matters the most” that the answer that rose to the top of your list was similar to the answer of this good bishop. What matters the most is obtaining the gift of eternal life which comes through knowing our Heavenly Father and by doing His will. In other words, put God first in your lives, and all of His blessings will follow. The blessings of the gospel, eternal families, spiritual strength, increased knowledge, peace in our hearts, comfort to our souls, and so many others all flow into our lives when we put God first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever considered what matters the most to our Heavenly Father and to the Savior? The scriptures give us some great insights. In the great intercessory prayer, Jesus said, “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">John 17:3</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Moses 1:39</a>, the Lord says, “For behold, this is my work and my glory – to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”</p>
<p>In the first few verses of that same chapter in Moses, God revealed himself unto Moses and said, “Behold I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years.”</p>
<p>So the Lord appears to Moses and identifies himself and says, “Moses, I am God!”</p>
<p>He then tells Moses who he is: “Behold, [Moses] thou art my son.”</p>
<p>And then He reveals something important to Moses and to every one of us when he says, “And I have a work for thee.”</p>
<p>Is there anything that we cannot accomplish when we understand this relationship? That there is a God, that we are His children, and that He has a work for us! The work that God has for us is the same as His work, to help us become like Him. To become like Him, we must know Him, we must understand Him, we must follow Him, we must trust Him, and we must put Him first in everything we do. The scriptures teach us that God is love and that “we love him, because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). Likewise, isn’t it comforting to know that we can also say that we put God first in our lives because He puts us first in His?</p>
<p><strong>Become Converted</strong></p>
<p>To put God first in our lives, we must be obedient to His commandments and become truly converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Conversion means more than being a member of the Church. It is deeper than accepting gospel principles and having a testimony that they are true. A testimony of the gospel is important because it is the gateway and foundation of conversion. However, there are many who have a testimony of the gospel and yet struggle to live even its most basic principles. When we are truly converted, we act upon the things that we believe and know to be true, we experience “a mighty change in heart,” and we become more like the Savior and our Father in Heaven with every decision and choice that we make.</p>
<p>President Marion G. Romney described conversion as a spiritual and moral change and in turning from one belief or course of action to another. He stated, “In one who is really wholly converted, desire for things contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ has actually died. And substituted therefore is a love of God, with a fixed and controlling determination to keep his commandments.”</p>
<p>One of the greatest privileges as a stake president is to set apart the full-time missionaries leaving from my stake. In my interviews, I find that while each missionary is unique, there are commonalities that each of these young men and women share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They have faith in a loving Father in Heaven and in the Atonement of their Savior Jesus Christ<br />2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They have a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Restoration<br />3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They have “clean hands” and are worthy to represent the Lord<br />4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They are excited, optimistic, and energized! They are ready to serve!</p>
<p>Many of you who have served missions can probably remember those feelings as you were preparing to leave on yours. You may have also been a little nervous about what you were about to experience. &nbsp;Am I really prepared to do this? Will I be able to learn the language? Will I feel the Spirit, and how will I know what to say? Will I love the people, and will they love me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years, these young missionaries strengthen their testimonies of the gospel by exercising faith in the Lord by loving and serving their brothers and sisters, by obedience to Heavenly Father’s commandments, and by losing themselves in the work. They endure many hardships, they sacrifice the comforts of home, they put off plans for education or work, and they work like they have never worked before in their lives. Is it any wonder that when they return home, they are changed, they are transformed from who they were to faithful disciples of the Lord? The “miracle” that we witness is their conversion to gospel of Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>It is a humbling experience to receive these young men and women home and to release them from their missions. It’s a bittersweet experience for most as they are both happy to be home with loved ones but have also left their hearts with people and places who have strengthened their love and devotion for the Lord. &nbsp;A few months ago, I released a missionary coming home from his mission. The hour of his arrival was late in the evening, and he had traveled all day. We opened with a prayer and had a brief conversation about his mission and areas where he served. I then asked him to share his feelings about his mission, what it meant to him, how it had changed him, and to bear his testimony. He looked at me and then looked down at the ground. I could see the tears begin to fill his eyes and then roll down his cheeks. He began to cry, softly at first, and then continuing with large uncontrollable sobs. I came around my desk and put my arms around his broad shoulders. When he finally regained his composure, I sat back down, and when our eyes met, I simply said, “Elder, you have had a wonderful mission!” He said, “Yes, President. I have been so blessed. I can’t even begin to describe the love that is in my heart for my Heavenly Father and my Savior and for the blessing that I have had to serve them.” He had experienced a “mighty change of heart” and had been truly converted to the gospel.</p>
<p><strong>Can Ye Feel So Now?</strong></p>
<p>I know there are many here who have experienced this mighty change of heart. You have felt the Spirit burn within you, you have felt the Savior’s redeeming love through the Atonement, and you have witnessed miracles in your personal lives and in the lives of others. For you, the question that Alma asks is this: “If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Alma 5:26</a>).</p>
<p>Elder Quentin L. Cook spoke on this topic in the October 2012 General Conference. He discussed the moral deterioration in every segment of our modern culture, the challenges of being obedient to Heavenly Father’s commandments, and the apathy and lack of commitment exhibited by members of the Church. Of this, he said, “It is not surprising that some in the Church believe they can’t answer Alma’s question with a resounding yes. They do not ‘feel so now.’ They feel they are in a spiritual drought. Others are angry, hurt, or disillusioned. If these descriptions apply to you, it is important to evaluate why you cannot ‘feel so now.’”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience has been that most who have been converted and then fall away usually “drift” away. Rarely does it start with a serious transgression or major doctrinal dispute. It usually begins as we become casual in our relationship with our Heavenly Father and fail to seek divine and spiritual guidance in our day-to-day lives. Our prayers become less frequent and less meaningful. Daily scripture study becomes weekly, and then monthly, and then almost nonexistent. We find ourselves becoming more involved in other activities that require our time and effort. Recreation, sporting events, and social activities also occupy our time, and soon, we find that our lives are so busy and involved that we no longer have time for the things that matter the most. Without the protection of the Spirit, pride creeps into our hearts, and we become less humble and teachable. We begin to embrace the standards and the philosophies of the world. We find ourselves easily offended, quick to judge and find fault in others, and slow to remember God’s mercy and love. &nbsp;In short, we have lost the companionship and guidance of the Holy Ghost and become easy prey to the temptations of the adversary. Satan knows when we are vulnerable, and he uses every temptation and every opportunity to deceive us and lead us away from our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Jacob described how Satan deceives us and the punishments that come to those that follow him: “But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his state! O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think that they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.27-28?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:27-28</a>).</p>
<p>Let us not be deceived by Satan. He is the author of all lies and makes promises that he cannot keep. His sole purpose is to drag as many of us down into misery with him. Last fall, Elder Holland was here in the islands and conducted a priesthood leadership training for all of the bishops and stake presidencies in Hawaii. One of the discussions centered around the challenging times that we are living in, the erosion of principles, morality, virtue, integrity, the family, and religious freedoms. Elder Holland explained that we are literally in a fight with Satan, but that victory has already been declared. We know who will win! Elder Holland then said something like this: I have played sports for almost my entire life, and I have been on winning teams, and I have been on losing teams, but I have never, ever chosen to be on the losing team. The Lord’s team will win collectively. The tragedy is when we lose individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then he asked us, “Brethren, what team do you choose to be on? Let us choose to be on the Lord’s side and to put Him first in our lives.”</p>
<p><strong>Examples in the Scriptures of Spiritual Strength and Conversion</strong></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon gives us many great examples of individuals who were valiant in following the Lord. Moroni was appointed chief captain over all of the Nephite armies at the age of 25. In Alma 48, the prophet Mormon describes the qualities and attributes of this great military and spiritual leader and then proclaims, “If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, &nbsp;the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men. Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.17-18?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Alma 48: 17-18</a>).</p>
<p>So what made these men great in the sight of God? How did they become so powerful in putting the Lord first in their lives, even after some of them had been the vilest of sinners who persecuted the Church and rebelled against God? Many of us learned the answer to this question as primary children: “They had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of sound understanding and they searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2-3?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Alma 17:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>How simple, yet powerful is this example of how to become truly converted to the Lord.</p>
<p>Elder Boyd K. Packer taught, “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>By studying the gospel and searching the scriptures, we come to know our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ because the scriptures teach us about them. There is great power in studying the scriptures as daily scripture study will inspire us to be more committed to the gospel, provide strength to face our challenges and trials, provide safety and shelter from the temptations and storms of the world, and open our hearts and minds to receive personal revelation from our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>The Sons of Mosiah “had also given themselves to much prayer and fasting.” Prayer is our connection with Heavenly Father. We pray to express love and gratitude, we pray for understanding and personal revelation, we pray to know his will, we pray for strength and courage to overcome challenges and trials, and we pray for all things that will help us feel closer to God.</p>
<p>My wife was trying to help our daughters understand that through prayer, we can develop a personal relationship with our Heavenly Father. Many times, our prayers seem to be more of a checklist of things we are thankful for and things that we ask for rather than an opportunity for our Heavenly Father to know us and for us to know Him.</p>
<p>She compared it to developing a new friendship with someone you would like to get to know. How would you do that? It might start by walking up and introducing yourself like this: “Hi, my name is Darren. We go to the same school and have a couple of classes together. I have a cat and two dogs. I like the beach and going out with my friends. Nice to meet you!” Would you then walk away without waiting to hear what your new friend might have to say? Is that all that you would want to tell him about you? The next day, would you walk back up to your new friend and repeat the same information? Hi, my name is Darren. We go to the same school and have a couple of classes together. I have a cat and two dogs. I like the beach and going out with my friends” and then walk away again?</p>
<p>I shared this example in a youth Sunday school class not long ago and role-played it with their teacher. I acted a little goofy, and the youth got a good laugh out of it. I asked if this approach would be successful if they were trying to get to know someone? The answer was no. We then discussed how this example may be similar to the way we offer our prayers. Often, our prayers may say the same things over and over again, and what we say really doesn’t communicate very much to our Heavenly Father. We then figuratively walk away without giving Him a chance to answer. I asked one of the young women, “Do you have a best friend?” “Yes,” she replied. I asked her, “What do you tell your best friend?” With a big smile, she blurted out, “Everything!”</p>
<p>Heavenly Father is our best friend. He loves us more than anyone and wants to bless us with everything that he has. We need to communicate everything with Him, our hopes, our struggles, concerns, fears, doubts, joys and sorrows, and what we are feeling. Then, we need to listen.</p>
<p>Can we follow the example of Enos in The Book of Mormon who shared this experience: “And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens. And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, they sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.4-5?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Enos 1:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>We need to communicate with God so that He can communicate with us. He also wants to tell us everything! He’s simply waiting for the chance!</p>
<p><strong>You are a Chosen Generation</strong></p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters, you are a chosen generation that our Heavenly Father has reserved for this time and dispensation, and it is critical for you to know who you are and who you represent. In a BYU devotional, Sister Sheri Dew said this about you:</p>
<p>“The simple fact is that our Father did not recommend Eve or Moses or Nephi or countless other magnificent exemplars for this dispensation-He recommended you and me. Do you think God would have left the last days to chance by sending men and women He couldn’t count on? … You simply must understand this, because you were born to lead by virtue of who you are, the covenants you have made, and the fact that you are here now in the 11th hour.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness that you are a chosen generation and that the Lord has placed His trust in you because He knows you, has confidence in you, and loves you. As we put God first in our lives, we prepare ourselves and others to receive all that the Father has, both in mortality and through the eternities. I will close with these inspired words from President Ezra Taft Benson:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that he can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He can deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, … and pour out peace.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities.</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father knows you and loves you, and through the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ, we can return again to His presence and become more like him. Of this I bear testimony in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>March 25, 2014<br />Michael J. Christensen<br />Budget and Housing Services Director, BYU–Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brother and sisters, aloha! I have been very fortunate to have married way above my league, and I thank the Lord each day for bringing us together. I earnestly pray for, and invite, the Spirit of the Lord to be with each of us during the time we are here this morning, that we all might be edified. I am a firm believer that when we put ourselves in situations where the Holy Ghost can teach us, great things can happen. This may often be somewhat unrelated to the actual meeting, family home evening, or devotional that we are participating in – as we exercise our faith and seek the Lord’s available blessings and inspiration.</p>
<p>In our family, we have three boys, followed by our two girls. A few of you have met our youngest daughter, Katy. Our three boys were all teenagers at the same time – something I didn’t know on some days if I would ever survive! We did our best to continue to have family prayer and scripture study, but often it was with children in all sorts of contorted positions. There was a particular time that we actually were all kneeling together and happened to be in a circle. As the prayer was being said, I realized Katy had stood up and was walking around a bit and talking, which in and of itself wasn’t all that unusual given her age and learning at the time. It finally dawned on me that she was walking around the circle and was playing duck, duck, goose! We are grateful for the unconditional joy and love that she brings into our lives each and every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our children are all dual citizens, one of Katy’s first friends here at BYU–Hawaii is a fellow Aussie, Matthew Duffus. Last year, for a class project, he made a video that I’d like to take a couple minutes and share with you. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_6pKG3aJWI" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_6pKG3aJWI</a>).</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I have taken the time to share this. The first is that we of course love her, and I was hoping that watching it might calm my soul as I stand here. The second is that because Down syndrome comes from a person having a third chromosome in the 21st pair within each of us, this past Friday – 3/21 – was World Down Syndrome Day. The third reason is just to provide a small shout out to the great work that you do as students, as represented by Matt’s efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth reason is somewhat related to the third. As I think of you wonderful students and this great campus, about as diverse as the world has to offer in terms of nationalities and cultures, there may be times when things may not always go as smoothly as we’d like. I remember a zone conference where our mission president tried to help some struggling companionships recognize the idea shared in Matt’s video about Katy – that we really are more alike than different. So whether you are from Taiwan or Tonga, Chile or China, France or Florida, I invite you to look with increased awareness toward the <em>similarities </em>that you find with those you meet here – and in areas where you do find differences in tastes, preferences, cultures, attitudes, and so forth, be sure to celebrate them in a way that will enrich your experience and your lives like few other times may be able to do. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that plug for awareness and love for all those around us, let me move toward some of the things I’d like to share with you today. I begin with a story from H. David Burton, former presiding bishop of the Church.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Like me, Bishop Burton served a mission in Australia. Through a unique set of circumstances, he had the opportunity to play golf with the legendary Arnold Palmer in an event in Melbourne near the completion of his mission. Bishop Burton expressed how nervous he was, given both the level – and legend – of his playing partner, let alone the fact that he’d not swung a golf club in the two years he’d been on his mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He joked that he hit his drive, then his second and third shots before arriving at Mr. Palmer’s ball for him to take his second shot. (I feel the same when I play with Brother Bliss over here – or most anyone else for that matter!) Bishop Burton described the “conversation between …. Palmer and [the] young caddie he was using for the first time. The young caddie, while handing Mr. Palmer his club, told him the distance to the flag was 165 yards, there was an unseen stream on the left, [with] … long and treacherous rough on the right. In a very kind, but firm way, Mr. Palmer reminded the young man that the only information he required was the distance to the hole. He further suggested he didn’t want to lose focus by worrying about what was on the right or left.” &nbsp;In my words, Arnold Palmer wanted to keep his eyes on the flag, which marked the hole, or destination, he was aiming for.</p>
<p>It is my hope today to use experiences, scriptures, and quotes to testify of ideas or principles which may help each of us as we establish and maintain our spiritual focus, keeping our eyes on the flag and avoiding concerns about what may be on the right or left.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>We live in a world that is glorious and wonderful with rich blessings and great advantages all made available to us through the inspiration of heaven. We live in a world where the enemy of our soul, Satan the Master Deceiver, would take those blessings and advantages, then tweak, twist, and turn them in an ever so tempting and slight a fashion so as to alter their intended purpose. We live in a world of 24-hour news channels, the Internet, iPods, smartphones, computers, tablets, and other gadgets coupled with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and hours of YouTube videos – all wonderful and good to the point where feelings come that we can’t live without them but which can also be utilized by Satan to create noise and distraction in order to confuse our focus and diminish our goals – including our ability at times to feel the influence and promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Now, lest you think I am immune to this, let me share an experience. This is the first iPod that my wife gave me. I felt like I was actually the last one in my family – or even on the earth – to get one. For many of the years I spent in the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City, I used public transportation to travel to and from work. A co-worker I associated closely with is now retired and serving a mission with her husband in Virginia. For the last several years before coming to Hawaii, she and I lived in the same area north of Salt Lake, so from time to time, we would end up on the same bus going home. One day, we had left separately for the elevators, but as I exited the building and was getting my iPod in place for the ride home, I ended up catching up to her. With my ear buds in place, she asked me if I ever had any quiet time. I told her that although the ear buds were there, often nothing was playing, and I just used them to send a signal to others that I didn’t want to have a conversation on the way home – and that actually <em>did </em>help me get some quiet time. However, I still reflected on her question. Just how much quiet time do I provide for myself, and how does this impact my responsiveness to the Spirit? Even now, if you visit my office, there will be music playing because I don’t like it to be “too quiet.” The same is true for you. How much “quiet time” do you provide yourself?</p>
<p>President James E. Faust said, “I … believe that in the future the opposition from Satan will be both more subtle and more open. While in some ways it may be more blatant, it will be masked with greater sophistication and cunning. We will need greater spirituality to perceive all the forms of evil and greater strength to resist it.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’ll forgive the personal indulgences, I’d like to share a few other experiences that have helped me learn to be more aware of developing greater spiritual strength by keeping my eyes on the flag in different ways.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Pack:</span> Since my parents had both been raised in Idaho, our family moved from California, where I was born, to Idaho Falls near the end of my 5th grade year. Over the summer (what little bit of summer there is in Idaho), we looked for and bought a home in the small town of Shelley, just south of Idaho Falls. There, beginning with my 6th grade year, my parents remained for nearly 30 years. One of the first friends I made after our arrival in Shelley is also named Mike. For the first several years of our friendship, exactly one foot separated us in height. Even though he eventually played four years of football at BYU, he stopped at 6’4” while I, on the other hand, closed the gap and grew to the lofty 5’7” stature standing before you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an Aaronic Priesthood holder, I was active in the Boy Scout program. As a deacon, I recall one particular overnight trip when we were to backpack into our campsite. Contrary to the counsel of my father, I opted to use an old wood framed backpack and then carry about everything imaginable with me for the campout. We were not far into the hike toward camp when it became apparent that even with good intentions, my inexperience and lack of listening to wise counsel was costing me dearly.</p>
<p>How fortunate I was to have not only a very kind but a much larger friend who graciously offered to switch packs with me. I recall being able to tell that it even became a struggle for Mike to carry my pack, but he marched ahead, and we eventually arrived at the campsite.</p>
<p>I recall the gratitude I felt then, and now, for a great and kind friend who was willing to literally lift the burden from my back that I was unable, or unprepared, to bear. I share two thoughts today as it relates to this experience. First is the reminder for us all regarding how we should approach the gathering and loading of our pack for the continuing march through mortality. For those of us that have been involved in attending church for a while, we know the things that we should be putting in our pack. They include, but are not limited to, daily prayer and scripture study, attendance at our church meetings, living the law of chastity, keeping the law of tithing, and living worthy of a temple recommend - accompanied by actually using it by attendance at the temple. Second is to testify of the manner in which the Savior, as our ultimately kind and much larger spiritual friend, will strengthen and share in the assembled burdens we carry. We keep our eyes on the flag as we recognize that He has invited all who labor and are heavy laden to come unto Him, that He may give us rest. This story is that of <em>the pack</em>!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Clothesline:</span> Let me share another story about the growing up years in Shelley and my friend Mike. The city blocks that surrounded our homes were very large but also generally did not have many fences to create undue obstacles. This made for some great open spaces in and around many of the homes and provided a very efficient way to get through the block often without detection. I have heard that some of the local youth would use this as a means of running away, perhaps after pelting a passing car with snowballs or leaving the front porch of a home where the doorbell had just been pressed. I am not sure what possessed these youth to do such things since of course Mike and I primarily used these backyard areas as forms of exercise to relax our minds in between studying for upcoming chemistry or physics tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On once such studious occasion, we were moving at a high rate of speed through the dark center of the city block. I happened to be in front on this occasion when all of a sudden I heard this crazy noise that I don’t really know how to describe, associated with a thud, and followed by the moaning of a wounded soul. As I returned, making sure that no man was left behind, I found Mike crumpled on the ground in a heap and clearly in pain. Upon further review of the situation, I realized that we had run directly toward a clothesline. I had passed successfully under it without even knowing it was there. Mike on the other hand… well, not so much! The clothesline had caught him just above the eye and had planted him ever so harshly upon the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had two primary thoughts on this experience over the years. First, we need to ever be conscious of those that we may be leading – either knowingly or not – and the paths upon which we might take them, with the second observation really being the polar opposite – we need to be conscious of those we might be following and the paths upon which they might lead us. Now, I was leading in good faith but without all the information or awareness of forces that surrounded us, and Mike was exerting the same faith in his following. Of course, we enhance our safety when we keep our eyes fixed on the Savior and His prophets. We also keep our eyes on the flag when we not only choose good friends but also when we choose to be good friends. This story is that of <em>the clothesline</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Voice:</span> Nearly 20 years ago, our second son Brendan was born about six weeks after I had been called into a bishopric. With my Sunday morning schedule, Annette would get the boys ready by herself and make their way to church. Often, the first time I would see my family awake on Sunday was as I was sitting on the stand. One Saturday night, I knew that Annette and the boys didn’t feel real great, but she had told me to go ahead and fill my assignments the next morning. It was a Fast Sunday, and during our sacrament meeting, there were four babies to be blessed – a large number for our ward. With all the resulting visitors, the chapel was absolutely packed, and I had not seen my family, so I just presumed they hadn’t made it. During the meeting, I suddenly heard a tiny cry and knew immediately that it was Brendan. I looked and looked until I finally found Annette over to my left against the wall. Earlier, I had been trying to help the deacons get a microphone ready for the baby blessings, and it hadn’t been cooperating, so I hadn’t noticed Annette and the boys come in on the other side of the chapel. After I took a seat and the meeting started, she had been hidden from my view by the family in front of her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, this story produces enough different thoughts that could be a talk all by itself, but let me just quickly mention a couple. Why did this little voice stick out to me in the way that it did, amongst all the other activity going on in a very full, and on that day, a somewhat noisy chapel? In the tenth chapter of John, we know the Savior shares a teaching that is particularly important to us in the Church, as it relates to such things as people in The Book of Mormon. The Savior notes that He has other sheep that are not of that fold, but then later in the chapter, he says, “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> In this instance, it was a voice I was familiar with and could pick rather easily out of the crowd. In Helaman chapter 5, the wicked who have imprisoned Nephi and Lehi hear a voice, and verse 30 says, “And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul.”</p>
<p>A number of years later, following the signs of the Savior’s death, when the Nephite people had gathered around the temple at Bountiful, “ they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that one of the most important things we can do in this life is to learn how the Holy Ghost interacts with, or teaches, us. We all know or say things such as “I am a visual learner” or “I learn best when such and such occurs.” We are all individuals with unique talents, abilities, and traits, so to me, it stands to reason that the Holy Ghost will then interact with each of us in ways that are unique and specific to us. We keep our eyes on the flag when we learn to specifically recognize how the Holy Ghost teaches and prompts us individually in our lives. This story is that of <em>the voice</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Talk:</span> When our third son Josh was about three, we were at the Sunday session of our stake conference. He was actively coloring in some of the <em>Living Scriptures</em> books we had, which some of you may have heard of or had in your homes. I naturally presumed he wasn’t listening to the proceedings of the conference. One of our dear friends, then serving as a counselor in the stake presidency, was speaking. He was talking about the challenges we all face in the world today. This included the wickedness that comes as people don’t honor and live by the law of chastity. As one sentence was shared, Josh stopped his coloring, looked up at me, and said, “Dad, that man said <em>sex</em>. That is <em>not </em>appropriate.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>I of course knew this wasn’t the time or place to try and have a discussion as to why it was OK that our stake presidency had counseled us on these important matters, so I just agreed with him, and we moved on. Now what was said and done was entirely appropriate, but it does remind me that we keep our eyes on the flag when we always strive to be appropriate, for we never know who is watching or listening. This story is that of <em>the talk</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Beacon:</span> After battling cancer for four years, my mother passed away in May 2006. My father had also faced his own health challenges in the preceding years. In May 2007, my father was placed in the hospital as he continued to feel poorly, and the doctors sought to better understand these challenges. I received an urgent call one day from my dad’s youngest sister who said he was being moved from the hospital he’d been in to one in Pocatello, where she happens to live, and that things were not looking good. I immediately left work, headed to Idaho, and spent the next four days with him while a number of tests continued, and he was stabilized. I prepared to return home on Sunday evening and told Dad I’d be back on Wednesday, as I anticipated attending meetings scheduled at BYU–Idaho on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dad took a sudden turn for the worse on Monday evening and for all intents and purposes was likely being kept alive by medical equipment and personnel. After the doctors assured me he was comfortable and given the fact that there were others who desired time to get there to see him, I had determined that any and all machines would be turned off on Wednesday after I arrived in Idaho again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I arrived on Wednesday evening, Dad was now sleeping most of the time. My auntie from California flew in that night and was picked up in Salt Lake City by the auntie I referred to earlier, and they drove to Pocatello, arriving just before midnight. When they arrived, Dad actually woke up, gave a happy smile when seeing his sister from Pocatello, but then his eyes and face really lit up, and he gave a huge smile when he saw his sister from California because he had not expected to see her. It was a face of joy I can still see in my mind’s eye now, as if it had happened last night. After a few minutes, he essentially went back to sleep. It reminded me that his mind and spirit was still very willing and able though his mortal body was worn out. That actually made the decision I had made even more difficult. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I decided to leave it all in the Lord’s hands and let things take their course, I was actually a little surprised when we prepared to leave and one of the nurses told me that it wouldn’t take long. I had anticipated maybe a couple days or so but didn’t really know what to expect. My aunties and I finally prepared to leave the hospital after 1:30 AM. Though I have many times since wished that I had chosen, or found, a way to remain at the hospital, I was probably tired, dazed, and didn’t really know what to do. If I stayed, my aunties would have wanted to stay, and I knew they were tired, and I didn’t want them up all night. I had a hotel room waiting in Rexburg and meetings scheduled that would start in just a few hours, along with some other associated issues, and all the scenarios quickly played over and over in my mind. So, I finally decided to go ahead and drive towards BYU–Idaho – a bit over an hour away.</p>
<p>As I approached the lower valley area, driving toward Rexburg, there it stood, beautifully situated on the hill and gleaming in the night sky: the glorious Rexburg Idaho Temple. Keep in mind that this took place eight months before the temple was dedicated, so thinking back now, I am actually somewhat surprised it was all light up. For me, in that moment, if felt like a tremendous tender mercy from the Lord. My mother had returned the year before to that God who had given her life, and now, as it turned out within another hour or so, so too would my father. It felt as if the Lord took this opportunity to personally assure me of the truths of His plan and the eternal blessings of the holy temple. We keep our eyes on the flag when we follow the counsel given by President Howard W. Hunter “to look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of [our] membership.” This story is that of <em>the beacon</em>.</p>
<p>Now, like &nbsp;each of you have, there are more experiences from life’s journey that could be shared, but let me switch gears a little bit from those for now. You will recall several instances in The Book of Mormon where strong spiritual experiences or events are described in some very unique ways. Let’s identify just three: First, in Mosiah 4:1, we read, “And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.”</p>
<p>The next two are closely related, literally. In Alma, chapters 18 and 22, we read first where Lamoni, then later his father, fall to the earth as if they were dead, following the teachings shared by Ammon and Aaron, the sons of Mosiah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the action, or reaction, demonstrated by these experiences is real, they are nonetheless perhaps not as common in our day. We should not wrongly consider, however, that the experiences we may have are any less real or any less powerful to our soul. As you sit here today, ask yourself this question: “When was the last time I had a great spiritual experience?” The answers may range from “It’s been a very long time” to “Early this morning” when, perhaps you did as President Hannemann counseled last month and gave the Lord the first hour of the day so that He could be with you the next 23.</p>
<p>Though we can’t force things of the Spirit, another question might be “What can I do to have more, or greater, spiritual experiences?” Elder Henry B. Eyring reminded us that “great faith has a short shelf life,”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> so we must continually refresh our testimony and spirit. I invite you today to seriously consider how you can increase the frequency and power of the spiritual experiences you are having. Think back to the earlier story about <em>the voice </em>and hearing Brendan’s small cry in the crowded chapel and how we keep our eyes on the flag when we learn to specifically recognize how the Holy Ghost teaches and prompts us individually in our lives.</p>
<p>One of the challenges noted earlier is the constant noise of life, including full calendaring and lots of technology. Elder Boyd K. Packer has taught that “reverence invites revelation.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> Elder Richard G. Scott has said, “He will always hear your prayers and will invariably answer them. However, His answers will seldom come while you are on your knees praying, even when you may plead for an immediate response. Rather, He will prompt you in quiet moments (italics added) when the Spirit can most effectively touch your mind and heart. Hence, you should find periods of quiet time to recognize when you are being instructed and strengthened.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a work assignment that took me there, this summer will mark 20 years since I first visited the Sacred Grove in New York, a little over a month after Brendan was born. It was a wonderful and uplifting experience. In order that the Spirit might be more effective in strengthening and instructing us and that reverence might invite revelation, we all need to find our own “sacred grove” in life. We need to make time to set aside the challenges and noise of the day to make time to ponder and pray. As we do this, the Lord can heal, succor, and strengthen us. One definition of the word “succor” – which, among other places in the scriptures, is found in Alma chapter 7, which we’ve heard several times this semester – means “to help or relieve when in difficulty, want, or distress; to assist and deliver from suffering.” &nbsp;Imagine in your mind the Lord’s intense desire to run to, or succor, us in our times of need. We may feel there isn’t enough time for these quiet moments, but I testify that application of this practice will increase the effectiveness of our days. Prayer and pondering will be anchors to our souls to help keep our eyes on the flag by seeking these reverent and sacred times. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we consider the need to keep our eyes on the flag and move forward without distraction, remember the very familiar story of Nephi and his brothers. Think first of the time in 1 Nephi, chapter 7 when they bound him with cords and planned his destruction. Then jump ahead to chapter 18, when they are on the ship, and Nephi is bound again. In this instance, not only did the Liahona stop working, but they were “driven back upon the waters for the space of four days.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> Think about the lack of progress that occurs when our eyes are <em>not </em>on the flag – the time and energy that is spent in unproductive efforts by those who, in this case, the scriptures tell us “knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that we will never see the “strait and narrow path”<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> as one that is restrictive. I see it totally as the opposite – it is liberating and empowering to our souls to not only know who we are and to know God’s plan, but it then becomes easier to not get blown about by every wind of doctrine. Sometimes, it can be the challenge of making it to our designated campground with an overburdened pack, it can be four days-worth of progress lost on the sea, or at other times, it can be so much more. Coupled with this, we should never be concerned about acting “too good” or being “too wholesome.” We need not be prudish, and although we should avoid being holier than thou, we should never avoid being holy. We keep our eyes on the flag and are greatly empowered when we set aside any sins or distractions that may so “easily beset”<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> us.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales has taught that “when we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures.” What a great blessing to have the scriptures we do, which includes the words of the living prophets. Not only can we talk directly to God, but He can, and I testify does, speak directly to us. Consistent and persistent effort is required to truly bring the full scope of the Spirit found in the scriptures to our lives. Elder Hales continues, “If you have not heard His voice speaking to you lately, return with new eyes and new ears to the scriptures. They are our spiritual lifeline.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring has taught that “Your copy of The Book of Mormon may be hidden from your view by cares and attention to all you have accumulated in your journey. <em>I plead with you to drink deeply and often from its pages. </em>It has in it the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the only way home to God.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>Recall section 18 of the Doctrine and Covenants and the scripture that reminds us that “the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.”<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a> Then listen to the words of the Lord later in the same section: “These words [<em>meaning the scriptures</em>] are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man; For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them; Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.”<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>We keep our eyes on the flag when we feast on the words of Christ, by drinking daily and deeply from the holy scriptures, and think as the Nephites did of the “immediate goodness of God and his power.”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> Then testify that we have heard His voice and know His words.</p>
<p>The temples of the Lord are a marvelous blessing to the children of men. They may be under-appreciated and even under-utilized by the general membership of the Church. Let us ensure that is not the case with us. The road to exaltation runs through the temple. A number of years ago, we attended the sealing of a ward member. The officiator indicated that over the course of his life, he had met many – both members of the Church and those who were not ¬– who had spent thousands of dollars to travel to Jerusalem, so they could say they walked where Jesus walked. Although that is a wonderful opportunity, he said that he would always invite people instead to come to the temple, to the House of the Lord, and walk where Jesus <em>is</em>! Elder J Ballard Washburn of the Seventy taught that “we go to the temple to make covenants, but we go home to keep the covenants we have made.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> We keep our eyes on the flag when we enter the Lord’s house to make sacred covenants, and then we go to our homes, our classes, and throughout our daily lives, and keep those sacred covenants.</p>
<p>In preparing to finish, I again invite you to consider the question “When was the last time I had a great spiritual experience?”. Perhaps there will be something familiar or that can be derived, as we strive to keep our eyes on the flag, from an experience such as:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify, as the scriptures and the prophets have taught, that there is no pain, no unfair act, no stress or strain, no affliction, no infirmity, no sorrow, no grief that we will ever experience that has not already been borne, suffered, and felt by our elder brother, the Lord Jesus Christ. Think of this when the noise of the world gets you down, think of this when the joys of the world lift you up. All can be blessed through the power and peace of the Atonement. He has already borne these things. We need not bear them alone without His help. If we will do our part, the Lord will stand with us in the furnace of our lives as he did with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Or if we have those days when we feel like a certain man who was traveling and fell among thieves, that we are stripped, beaten and left to the side of the road. I testify that He that is greater than the Good Samaritan will bind up our wounds, strengthen our souls, and lift us to become as He is.</p>
<p>During his first General Conference as the Lord’s prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “Now, my brethren and sisters, the time has come for us to stand a little taller. … This is a season to be strong. … It is a time to do what is right regardless of the consequences that might follow. It is a time to be found keeping the commandments. It is a season to reach out with kindness and love to those in distress and to those who are wandering in darkness and pain. It is a time to be considerate and good, decent and courteous toward one another in all of our relationships. In other words, to become more Christ-like.”<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One year prior to that, President Howard W. Hunter said, “We must know Christ better than we know him; we must remember him more often than we remember him; we must serve him more valiantly than we serve him. Then we will drink water springing up unto eternal life and will eat the bread of life.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>I know the gospel of Jesus Christ is restored upon the earth and is present in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I know that Thomas S. Monson is the Lord’s prophet on the earth today. I know that the holy temples are here to help us make and keep sacred covenants, to endow us with power and provide ordinances that will bind us together as families eternally. I know that the Lord Jesus Christ carried out the great Atonement on our behalf, that He might strengthen and succor us in our afflictions and challenges. I know that as we keep our eyes on the flag, not getting distracted by those things on the right or the left, but press forward with that great steadfastness in Christ, all that the Father hath awaits us. May we ever be found with our eyes fixed on the flag of faith and testimony which leads to Him is my humble prayer, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>March 18, 2014<br />Sheri L. Dew<br />Chief Executive Officer of Deseret Book Company<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha! I love this campus and what it means to the Church. I have visited many of your home countries and have met great men and women who were educated here and then returned to their homelands to build the Church throughout the Pacific. It is a joy to be here. Thank you, President Wheelwright, for the privilege of bearing my testimony from this pulpit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, last summer I spent a couple of weeks in Australia, New Zealand, and for the first time Samoa. While in Samoa, I visited the remote village of Sauniatu, located in the crater of an extinct volcano about 20 miles east of Apia. There is <em>no </em>easy way to get to Sauniatu. The only way in and out of the crater is up a steep path of jagged volcanic rock that tosses a vehicle around as though it’s a toy. You could probably walk up the side of the volcano and down into the crater to Sauniatu faster than you can ride there in a car. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had very little time in Samoa, and I wondered why my hosts insisted that we spend half a day going to Sauniatu, which is now an experimental farm where Samoan farmers practice new farming techniques, but I’m so glad that we did. As soon as I stepped out of the car, I felt as though I was standing on holy ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sauniatu means “prepare to go forth.” It was established in 1904 as a place of refuge for Saints who were being persecuted at the time. The village had its ups and downs, and at one point, it was almost wiped out by an influenza pandemic, and many questioned whether or not it could survive. But then in 1921, as part of his around-the-world tour, Elder David O. McKay visited the village and blessed the Saints that their plantations would be fruitful and that peace would abide in their homes and hearts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I walked around the lush, tropical landscape, it seemed perfect that a place that means “prepare to go forth” has become a farm. Farmers surely understand better than anyone that you can only reap what you sow. <em>Anyone</em> who wants to harvest <em>anything </em>must prepare by planting seeds and then helping them grow. You are in a crucial seed-planting era of your life, so today I invite you to think about the seeds you are planting in your life right now because those seeds will determine the fruits you will harvest for the rest of your lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has said that His field is white already to harvest and that for the last time, in this eleventh hour, He is calling laborers into His vineyard. He has given each of us a part of His vineyard to tend, so the seeds you plant and nurture will not only affect your life, and the lives of those you love, but the entire Church as well. “For he which soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Law of the Harvest is real. The Apostle Paul’s declaration that “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> is not just good agriculture. It is a pattern for our lives. As the daughter of four generations of farmers, I can tell you from firsthand experience that if you hope to harvest anything, you have to plant seeds and then care for them.</p>
<p>You can’t fake it as a farmer. Either seeds get planted or they don’t. Either crops are watered or they aren’t. A farmer can’t hide in a cubicle in the library or in an office (or even on a beach) somewhere and hope no one notices he actually isn’t doing anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our lives, we can’t fake it either. Oh, we might be able to slide by for a while. We might tell ourselves that our future will somehow magically take care of itself or that there’s plenty of time later to repent. We might try to kid ourselves and pretend that truth and morality are relative or that God and His laws don’t exist. However, self-deception won’t change the fact that it’s not possible to reap a reward for something we haven’t worked for, and even the most articulate argument to the contrary won’t change God and His laws or the truth about what is right and wrong or good and evil. The Lord’s words about this are clear: “What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Our Father will not turn a blind eye to laziness or bullying or unkindness or dishonesty or immorality. He will not reward ugly behaviors with peace of mind or, eventually, exaltation. It just doesn’t work that way. We cannot harvest the fruits of seeds we never plant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You know Alma’s teaching about planting and nourishing good seeds in our hearts: “Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed,...behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves–It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>True seeds, good seeds, enlarge our hearts and enlighten our minds. Truth and goodness are truly delicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, may I suggest five seeds worth planting and nourishing, seeds that will result in a harvest of peace, happiness, confidence, hope, and true joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number One: Plant the Seed of Discipleship</span></p>
<p>One of the most important choices we make is whether or not we <em>want </em>to live as disciples of Christ. Being a disciple is not for the faint of heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the October 2012 General Conference, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland spoke movingly about the apostles who remained after the death of the Savior. He reminded us that they were relatively young in their faith and weren’t sure what to do once the Savior was suddenly gone. At a loss, many of them followed Peter back to the lake to resume their lives as fishermen. The first night back on the lake, they didn’t catch anything–not a single fish. Then a Galilean stranger called from the shore and told them to put their nets down on the right side of the ship. When they caught so many fish that the weight broke their nets, they realized that it was the risen Lord on shore, and they hurried to greet Him. Then, in that memorable interchange, the Savior asked Peter three times if he loved Him, and three times Peter replied, “Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> Elder Holland then suggested what the Lord might have said to Peter after his third response: &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then Peter, why are you here? Why are we back on this same shore, by these same nets, having this same conversation? Wasn’t it obvious then and isn’t it obvious now that if I want fish, I can get fish? What I need, Peter, are disciples–and I need them forever. I need someone to feed my sheep and save my lambs. I need someone to preach my gospel and defend my faith. I need someone who loves me, truly loves me, and loves what our Father in Heaven has commissioned me to do. Ours is not a feeble message. It is not a fleeting task. It is not hapless; it is not hopeless; it is not to be consigned to the ash heap of history. It is the work of Almighty God, and it is to change the world.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>I wish we had time to talk about how you felt as we read those words together because they did not apply just to ancient apostles. They are for us. Today. <em>We </em>are men and women of the covenant, and we <em>each </em>have work to do. We each have a divine errand. We each have seeds to plant. Make no mistake about it. You are here now because you are supposed to be here now. You have a role to play in hastening the Work of Salvation, which is the happiest, most consequential work on the face of the earth. If you want a place in His kingdom, God will put you to work. Ours is not a “feeble message.” It is the only work that will <em>change </em>and <em>save </em>the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decide today if you want to be a disciple. If you do, plant the seed of discipleship. It will give your life a sense of purpose that exceeds any other.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number Two: Plant the Seed of Knowledge</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early 2002, while I was serving in the Relief Society general presidency, the Church instituted a security system that required those of us who frequented the extended Church campus in Salt Lake City– including Temple Square, the Conference Center, Church Office Building, Relief Society Building, and so forth–to wear ID badges. Because our presidency had served nearly five years, we were easily recognized, and I don’t remember ever actually using my new ID badge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one of the Saturday sessions of the April 2002 General Conference, our presidency was released, but we continued to come and go to that conference in the usual manner for General Authorities and general officers–through a series of pedestrian tunnels that connect the various buildings on the Church campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been assigned to speak early Sunday morning at a devotional for all of the General Conference hosts and hostesses, and I was to be in the Conference Center at 6 AM. As I drove to the Conference Center that morning, it dawned on me that heavy double doors located at various places along the tunnel might not be open that early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first door in the tunnel was locked. I noticed an intercom on the wall, pushed the buzzer, and asked the Church Security officer who answered if he would let me through the door. “Sister Dew, do you have your ID badge with you?” I thought but didn’t say, “You know who I am. Why do you need to see my badge?” but I rummaged through my binder and found the badge. The officer then said, “Just wave it in front of the sensor, and the doors will open.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Seriously. That’s fantastic! What else will this badge open?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He laughed and said, “You have a high clearance. Your badge gives you access to most doors throughout the Church campus. Didn’t you know that?”</p>
<p>“Amazing!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was already wondering what else my badge would open when he brought me down to earth: “Wasn’t your presidency just released, Sister Dew?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes,” I answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, enjoy your badge today because tonight at midnight, it will be deactivated.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As promised, my badge opened the doors through the tunnel, and also, as promised, the next day it no longer worked. The privilege was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The irony was unmistakable. For months, I had carried with me a badge that gave me privileges I had never made the effort or took the time to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are <em>you </em>walking around with that carries tremendous privileges but about which you know very little? What do you understand about the privileges that come with the gift and power of the Holy Ghost? Or ordination to the priesthood? Or your temple recommend, for starters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowledge is priceless, and knowledge about gifts from God is the most valuable knowledge of all. It is simply a mistake to not learn everything we can about the gifts God has given us–and particularly gifts that give us access to His power. Elder David A. Bednar has said that “knowing that the gospel is true is the essence of a testimony. Consistently being true to the gospel is the essence of conversion.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Conversion is what lifts us out of this world and gives us a vision higher than the world’s.</p>
<p>True conversion requires immersion–immersion in truth. Immersion in the word of God. Immersion in the teachings of prophets, seers, and revelators. Immersion in the temple. And immersion in the Spirit. True conversion doesn’t just happen. It takes sustained spiritual work. When we immerse ourselves in the gospel, we authorize heaven to tutor us. Our Father explained: “I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth <em>I will give more</em>.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;If we want to learn the mysteries of the kingdom, if we want to understand how God works, He will teach us–if we immerse ourselves in truth. It is a mistake to not learn all our Father will teach us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to progress, if you want to feel more confident, if you want to ensure your future, plant the seed of knowledge and immerse yourself in truth. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number Three: Plant the Seed of Revelation</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God wants to talk to us, and He expects us to learn to receive revelation. Last fall, I attended church in a wonderful ward in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I was enjoying Relief Society when the teacher suddenly ended her lesson early. Imagine my surprise when the Relief Society president said, “We’re happy to have Sister Dew with us today, and we’d like <em>her </em>to take the remaining time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an honor to bear my testimony that morning. Afterwards, I had barely stood up when a young woman your age threw her arms around me and said, “Sister Dew, I am visiting from Peru, and you are the reason I came to Brazil.” That seemed curious, since neither of us had known I would be speaking, but I asked what I had said that made a difference, and she repeated what she’d heard and why it helped her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That gave me an opportunity to point out something to her: “I am 100% sure that you heard what you said,” I told her, “but I am also 100% sure that I did not say it. What does that tell you?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She paused and then answered, “That the Lord was talking to me?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded and asked, “What else does it tell you?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She thought again and said, “That He knew what I needed to hear?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded again and asked, “What else does it tell you?” She wasn’t sure. “It tells you that you can receive revelation. The Holy Ghost translated what I said so that you heard what the Lord knew you needed. I am not the one who answered your prayer. It was God who did.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That young woman had received revelation, but she didn’t realize it. Each of us have to learn <em>how </em>to hear the voice of the Lord–we have to learn the language of revelation. Many of you here are bilingual. You know what it takes to learn a new language. The language of revelation is the way God talks to us, through the whispering of the Holy Ghost. <em>All of the rules that govern the language of revelation are in the scriptures.</em> That is one reason regular immersion in the scriptures is so important. That is where we learn how to hear the voice of the Spirit. It is where we learn what invites and drives away the Spirit. It is where we learn how to talk to God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Satan’s greatest deceptions is getting you to think you’re all alone. He wants you to believe that revelation is rare and certainly not something you can receive, but Elder Bruce R. McConkie countered that belief when he said that “there is no limit to the revelations <em>each member of the Church</em> may receive. It is within the power of every person who has received the gift of the Holy Ghost to see visions, entertain angels, learn the deep and hidden mysteries of the kingdom, and even see the face of God."<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;We live in the dispensation of the fulness of times, and the Lord has promised He will withhold <em>nothing </em>from us. He has said we would have about as much luck stretching forth our puny arms and attempting to stop the Missouri River as we would in hindering “the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints."<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>If we want to learn to receive revelation, we have to ask, but we have been promised, “If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge."<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>I was your age when I faced a major life decision. I had fasted and prayed many times and could not get an answer. I could feel the presence of the Spirit, but I couldn’t understand if the Spirit was saying anything. A wise mentor who knew about my spiritual struggles asked me if I had ever asked the Lord to teach me what it felt and sounded like <em>for me</em> when the Spirit was speaking. That question changed my prayers and my life. As I began asking that question, I began to notice one clue after another in the Book of Mormon about how heaven communicates with people on earth. The keys to learning the language of revelation are in the Book of Mormon. They are worth studying and pondering and practicing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning the language of revelation takes time. There is no magic formula. I can, however, suggest three keys: asking, regular immersion in the scriptures, and personal purity. Purity of thought and intent. Purity in what we watch, read, listen to, and surround ourselves with. Purity in language and even in what we wear, and certainly moral purity. The Spirit is more likely to talk to someone who is trying to be pure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can think of no more important seed to plant than the seed of revelation. The only way to discern between right and wrong, the only way to fulfill your divine errand, is to learn to receive revelation. God wants to talk to you, but He expects you to learn His language. Plant the seed of revelation, and it will change your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number Four: Plant the Seed of Faith in Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p>Several years ago, we had a harsh winter in Utah, and the snow was deep in my neighborhood. Deer wandered into my yard all winter scavenging for food. They ate the bark off of trees and mangled bushes. Once spring came, my yard was a mess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For weeks, I pulled out damaged perennials and planted shrubs and flowers. Finally, one evening, I finished. Early the next morning, I glanced out a window and noticed dirt on the sidewalk. I had swept everything the night before, so I stepped outside for a closer look and was dumbfounded with what I saw: dozens of plants were gone. Not half-eaten, but gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you do about stolen plants? Because it looked like vandalism, I called the police to see if any other yards in the area had been damaged. They sent a policeman who began walking around the neighborhood. Within minutes he was back, motioning for me to follow him. He led me to the backyard of my neighbors, who had just moved in, and there were my brand new plants lining their patio. “I assume these are yours,” he said. When I nodded yes, he knocked on the front door.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What a way to meet the neighbors</em>, I thought, as horrified parents quickly put two and two together. Moments later, they came marching out with the cutest little girl you’ve ever seen. <em>Oh no</em>, I thought, <em>I’ve called the police on a six-year-old</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little girl and some friends had been drawn to my yard by the flowers, and she thought they’d look nice in her yard. When they tugged on the newly planted flowers, they had come up easily. In short order, the little girl and her gang of flower-snatchers had worked their mischief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We quickly made amends, but as I planted a new batch of flowers, I couldn’t get an obvious lesson out of my mind: the flowers came up easily because they hadn’t had time to root. So, the question: How deep are your spiritual roots? Are you rooted in the Lord and His gospel, or are you enchanted with the world? If you aren’t rooted in the gospel, the adversary will attempt to uproot you with his equivalent of a six-year-old–meaning, it won’t take much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my life, I have had amazing opportunities as well as crushing disappointments. You can’t be my age and still unmarried without having had agonizing experiences and painful years. It was during one particularly difficult time that I began to understand that the Atonement is not just for sinners–that the Savior not only atoned for our sins but came to heal our broken hearts and to compensate for all of the pain we would ever feel.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;The Savior is filled with the power to forgive us, redeem us, strengthen us, enable us to do things we could never do on our own, and heal us. He will heal us from sin when we repent. He will heal our broken hearts. He will heal the most heart-wrenching grief, and He will turn weakness into strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior is our only chance to resist temptation, to conquer addiction, to compensate for insecurities and fear. He is our only chance to subdue the adversary, to conquer envy, to find enduring peace. He is our only chance to become like He is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We gain access to the power of the Atonement by having faith in Jesus Christ, by repenting, by pleading for His help, and by making covenants with Him and then keeping them. Plant the seed of faith in Jesus Christ, and that seed will bear fruit every day of your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number Five: Plant the Seed of Divine Power</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can either live our lives alone and attempt to rely solely upon our own talents or we can live our lives with the help of heaven. God actually wants a powerful people, and He has provided ways for both men and women to have access to His highest spiritual privileges and power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As early as age eight, a child may receive the gift and power of the Holy Ghost.<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a> At twelve, a boy may be ordained to the Aaronic priesthood, which holds the “key of the ministering of angels.”<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> And, as Elder M. Russell Ballard taught, “When men and women go to the temple, they are both endowed with the same power, which by definition is priesthood power.”<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> The temple endowment is a gift of power, and it is also a gift of knowledge to know how to use that power.</p>
<p>The temple is the place where it becomes clear that men and women both have <em>direct </em>access to God’s power. The temple is <em>the institution</em> of highest spiritual learning. It is where we may “grow up” in the Lord and receive a “fulness of the Holy Ghost.”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> We emerge from the temple “armed with [the Lord’s] power,” with angels having charge over us,<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> and we are promised that “<em>no combination of wickedness shall have power to... prevail</em>” over those who worship in the house of the Lord.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> Our Father wants a people who have learned how to gain direct access to His power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught that “where spiritual things are concerned, as pertaining to all of the gifts of the Spirit, with reference to the receipt of revelation, the gaining of testimonies, and the seeing of visions, in all matters that pertain to godliness and holiness and which are brought to pass as a result of personal righteousness in all these things men and women stand in a position of absolute equality before the Lord.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Every person–and that includes you–who makes covenants and keeps them has the privilege:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of opening the heavens and receiving revelation,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of receiving all of the ordinances of salvation,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of teaching and leading by the Spirit,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of understanding the mysteries of the kingdom,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of enjoying protection from the adversary,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of being strengthened to resist temptation,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of learning to part the veil between heaven and earth,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of being sealed for time and all eternity and becoming a candidate for exaltation, and <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –of being blessed by the ministering of angels, particularly if we ask for them to help us.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Father has given both His sons and His daughters access to His highest spiritual privileges. Plant the seed of regular temple worship. What will you harvest? Divine power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, to conclude, there is a lesson from the life of President Gordon B. Hinckley that we have perhaps overlooked because it occurred at the end of his life. President Hinckley was a bold leader filled with faith, but there were two things he feared: the first was getting cancer, and the second was losing his wife. His mother, brother, and sister had died of cancer. He feared cancer. And Sister Hinckley was the joy of his life, and he couldn’t imagine life without her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, in April 2004, Sister Hinckley missed General Conference. In his concluding remarks, President Hinckley acknowledged that she was not well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is a somber time for me,” he said. “We have been married for 67 years this month. … We’ve walked together side by side through all of these years, coequals and companions through storm and sunshine.”<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Two days later, Sister Hinckley slipped through the veil. President Hinckley was heartbroken and still recovering from the loss when, just nine months later, he was diagnosed with cancer. He underwent surgery, but the cancer had spread. Most assumed that, at the age of 95, he would not submit to treatment, but when he asked his doctors if they could administer chemotherapy to someone his age, they agreed to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One might wonder why he didn’t see his cancer at that age as evidence that it was time to reunite with his wife, but he explained, in words to this effect, “I feel I should do all I can to live as long as I can. Then when death comes, I will know it is the Lord’s will and that I did all I could do.” President Hinckley lived two more years–likely 12 to 18 months longer than he would have otherwise. In January 2008, he passed away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this final act of devotion, President Hinckley set a pattern for <em>all </em>of us. He demonstrated that, above all, he was determined to do all the Lord had sent him here to do. He modeled the admonition he had given the Church when he said, “We are all in this together. ... Within your sphere of responsibility you have as serious an obligation as do I within my sphere of responsibility. Each of us should be determined to build the kingdom of God on earth and to further the work of righteousness.”<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>President Hinckley was a disciple of Jesus Christ who <em>did as much as he could for as long as he could</em>. Decades earlier, he had begun planting seeds of faith and devotion to the Lord that he harvested in his final days and years.</p>
<p>We each get to choose which seeds we will plant in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span> lives and in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span>&nbsp;corner of the vineyard. May we plant the seeds of discipleship, knowledge, revelation, divine power, and faith in Jesus Christ, for those seeds will help us do as much as we can for as long as we can, and they will lead to a harvest of happiness, peace, hope, and true joy. May we immerse ourselves in the gospel of Jesus Christ until our conversion is full and complete.</p>
<p>I testify that no men and women on earth have access to greater privileges or more power than we do. I testify that the Work of Salvation is the happiest work you will ever do. And I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that He is filled with healing and power. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>March 11, 2014<br />Russell R. Watanabe<br />President, Waipahu Hawaii Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, good morning and aloha!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is always wonderful to be here on the campus of Brigham Young University–Hawaii. Although not a student here, I had the opportunity of attending the Language Training Mission, now known as the MTC, on this campus in preparation for my mission to Japan. This university was known as “The Church College of Hawaii,” and missionaries called to serve in Asia and the Pacific regions spent the first two months of their missions here.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hale 6 was our LTM home where we lived and studied. I fondly remember eating our meals in the cafeteria, attending Sunday church services in the Auditorium, and frequenting the small, crowded book store in the David O. McKay building for supplies and snacks. This beautiful Cannon Activity Center and the Lorenzo Snow Administration Building was the rugby field where we played touch football and soccer during our recreation periods. We played basketball on the outdoor courts where the Social Sciences Building now stands across from Hale 2. The Aloha Ballroom and the Student Center also did not exist then. One of our favorite Preparation Day activities was walking the beautiful grounds of the Laie Hawaii Temple. We were blessed then and how blessed you are now to attend this church university, to live in the shadow of the House of the Lord, and to daily feel of its sacred influence. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The glorious Plan of Salvation has always had a special appeal to me. The answers to the timeless questions “Who am I?,” “Where did I come from?,” and “Why am I here?” are found in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. In Proverbs, we learn that “where there is no vision, the people perish” (Proverbs 29:18). With vision can come motivation and so my purpose today is to address the questions “Who am I?” and “Why am I here?” with the hope that it will increase our vision and motivation to be valiant once more as true disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord said, “Behold, I will <strong>hasten </strong>my work in its time” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.73?lang=eng#72" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:73</a>). In his opening address at the 2013 October General Conference of the Church, President Monson said, “<strong>Now </strong>is the time for members and missionaries to come together, to work together, to labor in the Lord’s vineyard to bring souls unto Him.” Hastening the work of salvation has been the major emphasis of the Church since it was unveiled at the world-wide Leadership Broadcast on June 23, 2013. We have the privilege of being part of this great effort. To emphasize the importance of this work, President Monson said, “Wishing will not make it so. The Lord expects our thinking. He expects our action. He expects our testimonies. He expects our devotion.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why is the work hastening? In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read, “For behold, the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the <strong>last time</strong> that I shall call laborers into my vineyard” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">D&amp;C 33:3</a>). The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob quoted the allegory of the tame and wild olive trees: “And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the <strong>last time</strong> that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the <strong>end is nigh</strong> at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.71?lang=eng#70" target="_blank">Jacob 5:71</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is meant by the phrases “<strong>the last time</strong>” and “<strong>the end is nigh</strong>”? This refers to the last gospel dispensation and the end of the world as we know it. It refers to the second coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the ushering in of His great millennial reign. Of this glorious event, the Old Testament prophet Malachi said that it would be a “great and dreadful day," meaning a great day of rejoicing for those who have righteously and diligently prepared themselves by becoming true disciples of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/4.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Malachi 4:5</a>). It will be a terrible and dreadful day for the wicked and unrepentant who are not worthy to be with the Savior during His great millennial reign.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of His Second Coming the Lord said, “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/24.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">Matthew 24:36</a>). Only our Heavenly Father knows the exact day and hour of the Savior’s Second Coming but from the Lord’s own words we know “that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">D&amp;C 110:16</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the <em>Bible Dictionary,</em> we learn that “a <strong>dispensation </strong>of the gospel is a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the holy priesthood and the keys, and who has a divine commission to dispense the gospel to the inhabitants of the earth.” There have been many gospel dispensations on the earth. We often speak of the seven great gospel dispensations which are the dispensations of Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, the Apostles in the meridian of time, and this, the dispensation of the fullness of times, the final dispensation that began with Joseph Smith’s first vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because this final dispensation’s purpose is to prepare the earth for the “culmination of the purposes of God on the earth,” the members of the Church today have a very important responsibility (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/dispensations?lang=eng&amp;letter=d" target="_blank">Dispensation</a>,” <em>Bible Dictionary</em>). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve said, “We are making our appearance on the stage of mortality in the <strong>greatest </strong>dispensation of the gospel ever given to mankind, and we need to make the most of it. …We have a responsibility to the Church of the Lamb of God to receive the Lamb of God – in person, in triumphant glory, in His millennial role as Lord of lords and King of kings. <strong>No other dispensation ever had that duty</strong>” (“<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=1371" target="_blank">Terror, Triumph and a Wedding Feast</a>,” <em>CES Fireside</em>, Sept. 12, 2004).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The prophet Joseph Smith said that earlier prophets “have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipation they have sung and written and prophesied of this <strong>our </strong>day; … we are the favored people that God has made <strong>choice </strong>of to bring about the Latter-day glory; it is left to us to see, participate in and help to roll forward the Latter-day glory, the ‘dispensation of the fullness of times’” (History of the Church 4:609-10).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Notice that the prophet taught that we were <strong>chosen </strong>for the work of the Kingdom of God. The Lord himself said, “Verily, I say unto you that ye are <strong>chosen </strong>out of the world to declare my gospel with the sound of rejoicing, as with a voice of a trump” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">D&amp;C 29:4</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why were we chosen? The answer is found in the doctrine of foreordination. In the Church booklet <em>True to the Faith</em>, we find this explanation:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“In the premortal spirit world, God appointed certain spirits to fulfill <strong>specific missions</strong> during their mortal lives. This is called foreordination. Foreordination does not guarantee that individuals will receive certain callings or responsibilities. Such opportunities come in this life as a result of the <strong>righteous </strong>exercise of agency, just as foreordination came as a result of righteousness in the premortal existence” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/foreordination?lang=eng" target="_blank">Foreordination</a>,” <em>True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference</em>). &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jesus Christ was foreordained to be the Savior of the world. The Apostle Peter declared, “But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was <strong>foreordained </strong>before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these times for you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">1 Peter 1:19-20</a>). Elder James E. Talmage wrote, “We affirm, on the authority of Holy Scripture, that the Being who is known among men as Jesus of Nazareth, and by all who acknowledge His Godhood as Jesus the Christ, existed with the Father prior to birth in the flesh; and that in the preexistent state He was <strong>chosen and ordained</strong> to be the one and only Savior and Redeemer of the human race” (<em>Jesus The Christ</em>, 6).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the scriptures, we find other examples of righteous spirits foreordained in the premortal world:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These will I make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast <strong>chosen before </strong>thou was born” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22-23?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Abraham 3:22-23</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jeremiah was told by the Lord, “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The doctrine of foreordination applies to all members of the Church, not just to the Savior and His prophets. Joseph Smith said, “<strong>Every </strong>man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was <strong>ordained </strong>to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven <strong>before </strong>the world was. I suppose I was ordained to this very office in that grand council” (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, 365.) Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, “It was by divine design that the marvelous Mary became the mother of Jesus. Further, Lucy Mack Smith, who played such a crucial role in the rearing of Joseph Smith, did not come to that assignment by chance” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/02/a-more-determined-discipleship?lang=eng" target="_blank">A More Determined Discipleship</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Feb. 1979).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Quoting again from True to the Faith, “Before the creation of the earth, <strong>faithful women </strong>were given certain responsibilities and <strong>faithful men </strong>were foreordained to certain priesthood duties. Although you do not remember that time, you surely <strong>agreed </strong>to fulfill significant tasks in the service of your Father. As you prove yourself worthy, you will be given opportunities to <strong>fulfill </strong>the assignments you then received” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/foreordination?lang=eng" target="_blank">Foreordination</a>,"<em> True to the Faith</em>, 70).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alma taught that all who are ordained to the office of High Priest in the Melchizedek Priesthood in mortality were foreordained to that office in the pre-existence. Elder Bruce R. McConkie, commenting on these verses, said that not just the High Priests but “every person who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood was foreordained to receive that high and holy order in the pre-existent councils of eternity” (<em>Mormon Doctrine</em>, 290).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Listen carefully to Alma’s words: “And this is the manner after which they were ordained – being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the <strong>foreknowledge of God</strong>, on account of their <strong>exceeding faith and good works</strong>; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising <strong>exceedingly great faith</strong>, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such. And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3-4?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Alma 13:3-4</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The LDS scriptures with its chapter summaries, Index, Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, footnotes, and maps are a wonderful blessing and resource. Using the footnotes, let’s examine Alma 13:3 more closely, not just as the basis of foreordinations to the Melchizedek Priesthood but as the basis of all foreordinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first footnote in verse three is the letter “a” over the word “called,” which is referenced to mean “foreordination.” The second footnote, letter “b,” is over the word “prepared,” which directs us to the Doctrine and Covenants 138:56. The third footnote, the letter “c,” is over the first word of the phrase “foundation of the world” and refers to our “antemortal or premortal existence.” Up to this point, we might paraphrase verse three, according to the footnotes, as follows: “And this is the manner after which they were <strong>foreordained </strong>even<strong> before they were born</strong>, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were <strong>prepared </strong>to come forth to labor in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is my belief that we were among those who were taught and prepared and were among the “morning stars” who “sang together” and “shouted for joy” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/38.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Job 38:7</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Continuing, we learn that this was done according to the “foreknowledge of God.” What was the basis of God’s foreknowledge? Could it be the personal relationship we experienced as literal spirit sons and daughters of heavenly parents reared at their feet over the eons of our premortal existence? Surely, the inspired lyrics of the beloved Church hymn “Oh My Father” ring true!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 60px;">“Oh my Father, thou that dwellest<br />In the high and glorious place, <br />When shall I regain thy presence<br />And again behold thy face?<br />In thy holy habitation,<br />Did my spirit once reside?<br />In my first primeval childhood<br />Was I nurtured near thy side?” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />(“<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/o-my-father?lang=eng" target="_blank">Oh My Father</a>,” <em>Hymns</em>, no. 292.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Ezra Taft Benson said, “We once knew well our Elder Brother and His and our Father in Heaven. We rejoiced at the prospects of earth life. …We could hardly wait to demonstrate to our Father and our Brother, the Lord, how much we loved them and how we would be obedient to them in spite of the earthly opposition of the evil one. Now we are here. Our memories are veiled. We are showing God and ourselves what we can do. Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize <strong>how well we know our Father and how familiar His face is to us</strong>” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/12/jesus-christ-gifts-and-expectations?lang=eng" target="_blank">Jesus Christ – Gifts and Expectations</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Dec. 1988).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is because of this personal parent/child relationship that Heavenly Father has an intimate foreknowledge of each of us, a foreknowledge of our character and personality, our talents and interests, our strengths and weaknesses, and of our love for Him and our perfect brother, Jehovah or Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This foreordination is also based on account of our “<strong>exceeding </strong>faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose between good and evil; therefore having chosen good and exercising <strong>exceedingly </strong>great faith.” Notice that the words “<strong>exceeding</strong>” and “<strong>exceedingly</strong>” are repeated as if for added emphasis. I like to think of the meaning of these words in terms you can especially relate to – your school grades. “F” stands for failure. “D” represents poor performance. “C” means average, “B” represents good, and “A” stands for superior performance. What then does "<strong>exceedingly</strong>"<strong>&nbsp;</strong>equate to? In my mind, it represents the equivalent of an “A” grade. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If it does represent an “A” level of faith and good works, how was this manifested? From the scriptures, we learn that everyone was not equal in the level of their faith and good works. The Book of Revelation records, “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,” “And his tail [the dragon’s] drew a third part of the stars of heaven” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/12.7,%204?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Revelation 12:7, 4</a>). The Doctrine and Covenants also records “and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency. And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.36-37?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">D&amp;C 29:36-37</a>). We must sadly conclude that this group failed to exercise any level of faith and good works.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before this tragic war in heaven, we all had the opportunity to learn and understand Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness. Central to this plan was the need for a Savior. When Jehovah was selected by the Father, there were many who had doubts whether the plan would really work and if Jehovah would complete all He was ordained to do and fulfill the awful demands of the infinite Atonement when He condescended to the earth as Jesus of Nazareth, the son of the mortal Mary, and the only begotten in the flesh of our eternal Father in Heaven. Those who had complete faith that the plan would work, that Jehovah would not fail in His calling, and were <strong>valiant </strong>in this testimony, were known to Heavenly Father. This is how their <strong>exceeding great faith</strong> was demonstrated and proven.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What “<strong>exceedingly good works</strong>” did these valiant spirits then perform? Elder Stephen D. Nadauld, formerly of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, wrote, “What <strong>work </strong>was there to be done in the premortal setting? I believe there was the great work of explaining, of illustrating, of declaring, of teaching the plan! There was the work of witnessing that Jesus Christ would surely do that which He said He would – the work of inviting, teaching, and convincing that He would fulfill his divine mission – would come to earth and sacrifice His life. Thus those who had faith in the plan and <strong>demonstrated that faith by working to support, explain, and promote it</strong> truly stood out – in other words, were those who became personally identified by God as leaders” (<em>Principles of Priesthood Leadership</em>, 6-7). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Along this theme, Elder James J. Hamula of the First Quorum of the Seventy said, “You are those who chose good over evil and who exhibited ‘exceedingly great faith’ and ‘good works.’ And because of your personal history, you were entrusted to come to the earth in these last days to <strong>do again what you did before</strong> – to once again choose good over evil, exercise exceedingly great faith, and perform good works – and to do so in behalf of the kingdom of God on the earth and your fellowman!” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/winning-the-war-against-evil?lang=eng" target="_blank">Winning the War against Evil</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 2008).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I love that thought! We have been chosen, foreordained, and entrusted to come forth in this last and greatest gospel dispensation of time to<strong> do again what we did before</strong> in being valiant in our testimonies of Christ and to help prepare the Church for the Second Coming of the Lord. Continuing Elder Holland’s earlier quote, “Collectively speaking – whether it is in our lifetime, or our children’s or our grandchildren’s or whenever – we nevertheless have the responsibility as a Church and as individual members of that Church to be worthy to have Christ come to us, to be worthy to have Him greet us, and to have Him accept and receive and embrace us. The lives we present to Him in that sacred hour <strong>must be worthy of Him</strong>!” (“<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=1371" target="_blank">Terror, Triumph, and a Wedding Feast</a>,” <em>CES Fireside</em>, Sept. 12, 2004).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because we did it in the pre-existence, we have the faith, ability, and experience to do it again and to be <strong>valiant once more</strong>!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There may be times in our lives, as we are righteously engaged in the work of the Lord, we have impressions that we’ve experienced something before. Last September, a special Priesthood Leadership Conference in Hawaii was held with Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Ulisses Soares of the Presidency of the Seventy, and Elder Aley Auna, our Area Authority Seventy. In attendance were the Stake Presidencies of all fifteen Hawaii stakes and the bishops and branch presidents of every ward and branch of the Church in Hawaii. As I entered the chapel, I felt the presence of the authority and power of the priesthood. As I greeted my friends and brethren in the priesthood, I had the impression that we had experienced this before, not in this life but in our premortal one. The veil is indeed thin at special times in our lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 60px;">“For a wise and glorious purpose<br />Thou has placed me here on earth<br />And withheld the recollection<br />Of my former friends and birth;<br />Yet ofttimes a secret something<br />Whispered, ‘You’re a stranger here,’<br />And I felt that I had wandered<br />From a more exalted sphere.”<br />(“<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/o-my-father?lang=eng" target="_blank">Oh My Father</a>,” <em>Hymns</em>, no. 292)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Joseph F. Smith said, “But in coming here, we forgot all, that our agency might be free indeed, to choose good or evil, that we might merit a reward of our own choice and conduct. But by the power of the Spirit, in the redemption of Christ, through obedience, we often catch a <strong>spark </strong>from the<strong> awakened memories</strong> of the immortal soul, which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our <strong>former home</strong>” (<em>Gospel Doctrine</em>, 1977, 213-14).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During my high school years, I had an experience I will always be grateful for. I came across the lyrics of the hymn “<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/o-my-father?lang=eng" target="_blank">Oh My Father</a>.” I had sung it in Church many times over the years, but for the first time, I really took notice and seriously pondered its meaning. The Spirit bore powerful witness to me of these glorious truths, and I understood, as I had never before, what it means to have a “burning of the bosom.” I knew with a certainty that the plan of salvation was true, that I had lived before as a beloved spirit son of heavenly parents with the full potential of my divine nature and destiny. This gave me the desire to prepare for and receive my patriarchal blessing. I wanted to know my purpose in life and what I was foreordained to do on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Growing up in the Church, I was taught that the first law of heaven is obedience. “There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated— And when we obtain any blessings from God, it is by <strong>obedience </strong>to that law upon which it is predicated” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">D&amp;C 130:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Foreordination does not determine what <strong>must </strong>be but what <strong>can </strong>be. Like all other blessings, any foreordination is conditional upon our faithful obedience to the principles of righteousness. Sadly, there are many examples throughout history of those who did not keep this, their second estate. King David comes to mind. How the Lord loved David and blessed him with great opportunities, and yet we learn that David “hath fallen from his exaltation, … and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">D&amp;C 132:39</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And so the important question is “What must I do to be <strong>valiant once more </strong>and fulfill what I was <strong>foreordained </strong>to do?” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>1. Understand your noble spiritual heritage. </strong><br />Prepare for, worthily receive, then study and ponder your patriarchal blessing. It contains personal counsel from the Lord and will guide, comfort, and protect you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2. Gain a valid testimony of the gospel. </strong><br />A testimony is to know through the spiritual witness of the Holy Ghost that the gospel is true. It is a sure knowledge that our Father in Heaven lives and loves us, that Jesus is the Resurrected Christ who accomplished the infinite Atonement, that the Gospel has been restored to the earth through the prophet Joseph Smith, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true and living church on the earth, which means that in the Church is found the fullness of the Lord’s gospel teachings and commandments, the necessary ordinances of exaltation, and the priesthood keys and authority to perform these ordinances, and that the Church today is led by a living prophet of God, Thomas S. Monson.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>3. Become truly converted. </strong><br />Having a valid testimony is important and is a measure of real spiritual progress. However, as important as a testimony is, it is not enough. Real conversion is required for us to enter into the highest glory of the Celestial Kingdom. Real conversion is much more than testimony. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said, “To testify is to know and to declare. … To be ‘converted’ … [is] to <strong>do and become</strong>” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Challenge to Become</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2000). Real conversion is faithfully and consistently living the gospel everyday. Real conversion is the ongoing process of <strong>becoming </strong>like our Savior through sincere repentance, obedience, sacrifice, service, and enduring to the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>4. Be worthy of a temple recommend and use it regularly. &nbsp;</strong><br />One who is truly converted understands the importance of and is committed to making and keeping sacred covenants. We begin our journey along the covenant path to exaltation at baptism and confirmation. We continue along this path when the brethren receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and when we are endowed and sealed in the holy temple. Elder Oaks said, “The <strong>temple </strong>is the great final <strong>measure </strong>of <strong>real growth</strong>. Not just the temple experience, but the <strong>making </strong>of covenants in the temple and then <strong>keeping </strong>those <strong>covenants</strong>” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/what-is-real-growth?" target="_blank">What Is Real Growth?</a>” <em>LDS.org</em>). &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By understanding who we are, through testimony, conversion, temple worthiness, and the making and keeping of sacred covenants, especially our temple covenants, we can be prepared to be truly<strong> valiant once more</strong> and again exercise<strong> exceedingly great faith and good works</strong> in hastening the work of salvation and in fulfilling all that we were foreordained and sent here to do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 60px;">“When I leave this frail existence,<br />When I lay this mortal by,<br />Father, Mother, may I meet you<br />In your royal courts on high?|<br />Then, at length, when I’ve completed<br />All you sent me forth to do,<br />With your mutual approbation<br />Let me come and dwell with you.”<br />(“<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/o-my-father?lang=eng" target="_blank">Oh My Father</a>,” <em>Hymns</em>, no. 292)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is my desire for my family, each member of the Waipahu Hawaii Stake, and all of us here.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I know that our Father in Heaven lives and loves us. I know that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. I know that the gospel has been restored in its fullness in these latter days. I love the Savior and His gospel. I love being a member of His church. With gratitude and rejoicing, I share these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140304<br><title>We Are Connected to God by Covenant – Remembering Where We Came from and Who We Are | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>March 4, 2014<br />Jesse R. Baer<br />Vice President of Facilities, Polynesian Cultural Center<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer quoted President J. Reuben Clark Jr. and spoke about his remarks many times. President Clark said that “you do not need to sneak up behind this spiritually experienced youth and whisper religion in his ears; you can come right out, face to face, and talk with him. You do not need to disguise religious truths with a cloak of worldly things; you can bring these truths to him openly, in their natural guise” (“The Charted Course of the Church in Education,” J. Reuben Clark Jr., August 1938).</p>
<p>With that in mind, I wanted to study the “Doctrine” from the scriptures, and relate some things I have learned from experiences I have had here in Laie.</p>
<p>The first experience was in the Polynesian Cultural Center: the Tahiti Village devotional in June when my wife and I were here deciding to come to Hawaii or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the devotional, students were invited to talk about their parents or grandparents and what brought them to Laie. The experiences of the parents were the foundation of their lives and their purpose of being here at BYU–Hawaii and working at the PCC. Those students talked about how the experiences and testimony of their parents were the foundation of their own testimony of the gospel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second experience is in the village of Aotearoa. The carvings over the <em>whare</em> (or <em>hale</em> or <em>fale</em>) Hawaiikiroa were getting old and rotting. They were the original carvings done in New Zealand from 1961 to 1963 and then brought to PCC in 1963 when the whare and PCC were originally built.</p>
<p>Totara trees were cut and sliced and prepared to the correct size and carved in the traditional Maori pattern by a Maori master wood carver and five others who worked under him. A Maori master wood carver not only knows how to use the tools and to cut and carve the wood, but he also knows the history of his tribe and his ancestors because the carvings tell of the genealogy of his ancestors, so the whole Maori whare in all the designs and carvings and painting tells the history of the tribe in the story of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Each traditional Maori whare in New Zealand of the different tribes tells the story of their family and ties in the history of each family’s common ancestors of the tribe. The history goes all the way back to their common ancestor, and each whare is the named for the common ancestor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is an incredible thing that all Polynesian cultures have in common. They place great importance on knowing the family genealogy. In Samoa, the most revered <em>tulafale</em> or talking chief is the one that knows his own genealogy the best and also knows the genealogy of other <em>aiga</em> or families. He can recite the genealogy of the chiefly titles and knows where the authority of the family’s chiefly titles come from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now because of the things I had learned and pondered as I studied the scriptures, these experiences connected to several eternal things for me. Let’s study together and liken the scriptures to ourselves and connect them to the “Doctrine of the Kingdom.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>D&amp;C 2 is an extract from the Joseph Smith History of the night that the angel Moroni first visited Joseph and began to instruct him in his calling as the prophet of the Restoration. He quotes the prophet Malachi but changes the wording in a very significant way: “Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.1-3?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 2:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>Ponder that for a minute.</p>
<p>I also attended the early morning ceremony in the Maori village where the Maori people dedicated the refurbished whares in a traditional way. Of course, speeches were given back and forth between the Maoris here in Laie and the Maori people overseeing the village at the PCC and the wood carvers and missionaries and all those who participated in the restoration work. This was to express thanks to all those workers and leaders, missionaries and prophets who had &nbsp;come before and who made the building of this place possible and also for those of us at the PCC being the beneficiaries of the great gift of craftsmanship and knowledge and abilities of the wood carvers and missionaries in their labor and efforts in the construction work. Expressing the thought of the Maori saying, “We warm our hands on the embers of the fires we never built.”</p>
<p>Speeches and traditional chants were given by the Maoris in the Maori language, but being here in Hawaii at the Polynesian Cultural Center, there is always deference given to the Hawaiian Culture. They are the host culture and invite all the other islands depicted at the PCC to use a portion of native Hawaiian land to house and demonstrate their culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cy Bridges (the director of protocol at PCC) gave his speech in Hawaiian, reciting his genealogy all the way back to Hawaiiloa, who is the common ancestor of the Maori and Hawaiian and all of the Polynesian people.</p>
<p>Now, those island people who know and understand the covenants of the Lord and the Restoration of the gospel, as they liken the scriptures to themselves, surmise that Hawaiikiroa, the common ancestor, was actually Hagoth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is fascinating to me. The ancient history is not just lost away and forgotten but remembered in the traditions of Polynesian cultures</p>
<p>Hawaiikiroa is depicted in the center carving of the <em>koruru</em>, and the warrior depicted on top of the koruru is called the <em>tekoteko</em>. The depiction is of Maui-kai-ariki, the son of Hawaiikiroa and the father of the Maori people.</p>
<p>What is incredible to me as I ponder the meaning is that everything in the Maori whare depicts the ancestors of the tribe. Each figure represents the linage of ancestors, from the oldest in the back to the most recent in the front entrance of the whare. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The third experience that connects all these things together happened to a small-in-stature, much skinnier, palagi missionary with a full head of hair back then in February of 1976. President Spencer W. Kimball and his counselor N. Eldon Tanner and several other general authorities traveled though the South Pacific and held area conferences everywhere they went. They spoke to 1,000 saints in American Samoa on the 17th of February and then traveled to Western Samoa and over three days participated in traditional ceremonies, met with government officials, and held meetings. On the second day, they met with missionaries. President Kimball was getting a cold, so he didn’t meet with the missionaries, President Tanner presided and instructed at that meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then on the 19th of February, 15,000 Samoan saints gathered in a day of meetings, morning and afternoon sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kimball was the concluding speaker. As I recall it, Lafi Toelupe was translating for President Kimball. President Kimball ended his talk five minutes before the hour, and Brother Toelupe turned to him and said, “President you still have five minutes,” and with that, President Kimball turned to Alma 63 and read these verses: “And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward. And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year. And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward. And it came to pass that they were never heard of more” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/63.5-8?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Alma 63:5-8</a>).</p>
<p>President Kimball then said that “the Polynesian people are descended from the Nephite Hagoth.”</p>
<p>President Kimball was reiterating the same things that were said by Elder George Q. Cannon. who served his mission in Hawaii from 1850 to 1854 and later served as counselor to four presidents of the Church. The same statements were made by President Joseph F. Smith who served his mission in Hawaii at the age of 15 in the 1850’s and again lived in Hawaii from 1885 to 1887 and became president of the Church. He visited Hawaii several other times, having a great impact on the saints in Hawaii and especially here in Laie, including dedicating the site for the temple so near us today.</p>
<p>President Kimball told the Samoan saints that “they needed to play an important part in the gathering of Israel.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these three experiences reinforced what I have learned when I was taught about the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title" target="_blank">Title Page of The Book of Mormon</a>. We surmise it was written by Moroni, and it was one of the plates Joseph translated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites — Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift of God.</p>
<p>“An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.”</p>
<p>In Moroni’s mind, the first thing he thought about as the purpose of the Book of Mormon was: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That it was written to the remnant of the house of Israel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To show what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers - “The Blessings of the Fathers”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “The remnant of the House of Israel” and “That they may know the Covenants of the Lord”</p>
<p>Let’s let Nephi writing from a thousand years before Moroni wrote the title page explain what Moroni was telling us: “In the latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed—And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.13-14?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">1 Nephi 15:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>That special relationship between us, our fathers or ancestors, and God is confirmed, sealed, and cemented by the covenant relationship God has established from the beginning before the world was. That covenant was reestablished and restored to the earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>In the establishment of the covenants, Abraham knew the special promises made to the fathers. He wanted that for himself and his posterity.</p>
<p>In reiterating the covenant relationship that God had made with Adam, Enoch, and Noah, and reiterating the everlasting covenant the Lord Promised Abraham, God says, “My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations; And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/2.8-10?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Abraham 2:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>As many as receive this “Gospel” – the Gospel of Jesus Christ or the Doctrine of Christ, the only pathway to salvation – are called the sons and daughters of Abraham, and our patriarchal blessings tell us that we are tied to Abraham usually through one of his third great-grandsons, and we bless Abraham because of his righteous example and desire to make the covenants available to all of his posterity.</p>
<p>Participating in the gospel we make covenants. Beginning covenants are Aaronic Priesthood covenants. Advanced covenants are Melchizedek Priesthood covenants, the eternal exalting covenants of the temple &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here at BYU–Hawaii, your advanced or upper division course classes add on to and extend your knowledge of the subjects you have been studying. Those upper division classes qualify you to teach others or to work in your field of expertise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how Abraham describes who he was, his feelings, and what was most important to him in the world: “And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, holding the right belonging to the fathers” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Abraham 1:2</a>).</p>
<p>This is exactly as Moroni explained to Joseph Smith: “And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.2-3?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">D&amp;C 2:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>To close, let me read some verses of scriptures that explain our covenant relationship and who we are as covenant makers and covenant keepers and what our Father in Heaven expects of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.2-3?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">D&amp;C 66:2</a><br />“Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and apostles in days of old.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">D&amp;C 45:9</a><br />“And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.12-13,%2016,%2039-40?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">D&amp;C 101:12-13, 16, 39-40</a><br />“And in that day all who are found upon the watch-tower, or in other words, all mine Israel, shall be saved. And they that have been scattered shall be gathered. Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God. When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the earth and the savor of men; They are called to be the savor of men; therefore, if that salt of the earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing only to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.5-6?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Alma 26:5-6</a><br />“Behold, the afield was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted. Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.”</p>
<p>The following are the words of Jesus Christ to the Nephite saints and were recorded on gold plates, so they would be preserved through centuries, so the words and testimony of the prophets and the teachings of the Savior would be restored in our day. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">3 Nephi 18:24</a><br />“Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed. And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world.”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I bear my testimony that I have learned for myself that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I love to teach and share the gospel and the things that I have learned as I have pondered and studied the scriptures and as all things on earth witness and testify that Jesus is the Christ. And I say that in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>February 25, 2014<br />Lee Tom Perry<br />Dean of the Marriott School of Management at BYU-Provo<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I would like to start by talking about what this university and the Laie community mean to me and the difference they have made in my life. My first visit here was also my longest. It occurred when I was a freshly minted missionary. I attended the Hawaii Language Training Mission (LTM) in Hale 2 to learn Japanese in the fall of 1970.</p>
<p>I can’t explain what it was like to see Oahu for the first time. I was called from the Boston, Massachusetts Stake, where my family lived, so I had lived close to the ocean. The ocean of Boston Harbor or Cape Cod, however, was not at all like the ocean surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. They were completely different colors—one a brownish-gray and the other a greenish-blue. I must admit that it was terribly difficult to be a newly called missionary and live for two months in this place. A couple of times, my little district of four missionaries went right up to the water’s edge on Laie Point, but I am happy to report that none of us even dipped a toe into the beautiful ocean.</p>
<p>It was very early in my two-month stay in Hawaii that President and Sister Joseph Fielding Smith visited the campus. They came to Laie to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Church College of Hawaii and visit the Polynesian Cultural Center. This was the first time I had ever been in the presence of a living prophet of God, and, as you can see, when a group picture was taken, I moved in very close to the Smiths.</p>
<p>I was able to return to Laie in November of 1974. I accompanied my father, who at the time was the most recently called apostle. He and I were on our way to Japan. He had an assignment to tour my former mission (the Japan West Mission), the Japan East Mission, and divide the Tokyo Stake. I was his companion, instead of my mother, who was forced to stay home because she was in the late stages of her four-year battle with cancer. She died approximately a month and a half after we returned home from our trip.</p>
<p>The one thing I remember most vividly from my second visit to Laie was being made an honorary chief at the Polynesian Cultural Center. I think the Center’s leaders concluded that it would be very difficult for my father to live with me if I were a chief and he wasn’t, so he was also made an honorary chief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a long time before I visited Hawaii again. As a family, we vacationed in Laie during the Christmas season of 1997, and we stayed long enough to celebrate the new year of 1998. A faculty member from BYU–Hawaii, Professor Randy Allred, was on leave and living in my ward in Orem, Utah for a year while I served as the bishop, and the Allreds arranged with a friend for us to rent her condominium for two weeks while she was visiting the mainland. I’m pretty certain my wife and children would rank that vacation to Hawaii at the top of their fond memory list. The problem for all of us since then is nothing else has quite measured up. Once you’ve been to paradise, you’re far less impressed with anywhere else.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, only a few years later, I was given a very special assignment. While I was serving as an associate dean at the Marriott School, I was asked by President Merrill Bateman to chair the BYU–Hawaii Futures Committee and also serve as his liaison to the university here. At the time, the president of BYU–Hawaii actually reported directly to the president of BYU–Provo. I was privileged to serve in this role for approximately two years, and it offered me the opportunity to make several trips to Laie. I developed some choice friendships over that period of time, especially with President Eric Shumway and Vice President Keith Roberts. Everyone I worked with at BYU–Hawaii was extraordinarily kind to me, and the concentrated dose of the spirit of Aloha I received during that period of my life has been a blessing to me ever since.</p>
<p>What differences has BYU–Hawaii made in my life? The most obvious difference is I have a deeper appreciation for natural beauty and the variety as well as the intricacy of God’s creations. There are few places in the world where the majesty of His creative hands is more evident. I have also gained a greater appreciation for multi-cultural differences and some of the blessings and challenges that inevitably come when people with a broad range of backgrounds try to knit their hearts together in Christ. This place has been, is, and will continue to be a grand experiment in bringing together all of God’s children. It is its own united nations. I have also learned how thoughtful, kind, accommodating, and self-sacrificing people can be when they are deeply committed to the kind of grand vision that guides BYU–Hawaii. I am so honored to join you again after far too many years of being away, to be changed in new ways simply because I’m here sharing the spirit of this campus with each of you. Aloha!</p>
<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong></p>
<p>It is clear I am a different person from my association with your community and university. &nbsp;The communities and institutions in which we live, learn, worship, and work influence and change all of us in subtle but profound ways. Scholars often refer to this process as socialization or acculturation. Parents tell their children to choose their friends wisely because they know friends will influence their children for good or ill. Similarly, we must choose our communities and institutions wisely because they also influence us. Influence, however, is nearly always two-way. For example, when parents also instruct their children to be a positive influence within their circle of friends, they acknowledge that influence is two-way. The quality of a group of friends can be raised or lowered by the influence of a single member of the group, particularly a strong and influential member. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to focus my remarks today on the possibilities we have to make a positive and lasting difference together. Let’s start with the positive difference we can make as individuals. Pause for a moment to think about the difference Joseph made after he was sold into Egypt. Clearly, he was in a strange land, both socially and culturally. He had his ups and downs in Potiphar’s household, prison, and Pharaoh’s court, but no matter what his station in life, he found a way to make a difference. In Genesis 41 we read:</p>
<p>“And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</p>
<p>“And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:</p>
<p>“Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/41.38-40?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">Genesis 41:38-40</a>).</p>
<p>It was Joseph who interpreted Pharaoh’s dream, offered a plan to store enough corn during seven years of plenty to endure seven years of famine, and implemented the plan so successfully that “all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/41.57?lang=eng#56" target="_blank">Genesis 41:57</a>). Indeed, Joseph’s influence made a positive, profound, and lasting difference far beyond the borders of Egypt and ultimately reconnected him with his half-brothers, brother, and father.</p>
<p>Making a positive difference is the central theme of the well-known Frank Capra film It’s a Wonderful Life. George Bailey is on the verge of committing suicide because he is frantic about a large sum of money—his depositors’ money—that had been lost from the Bailey Brothers’ Building &amp; Loan that George manages. He fears he will be arrested for his failures as a fiduciary, and just when George is ready to jump off a bridge into the freezing river that runs beneath it, Clarence, his guardian angel, rescues him by jumping into the river first. Clarence has his own back story—he is still an Angel Second-Class who hasn’t earned his wings, but in the case of George Bailey, Clarence proves himself and becomes a true difference-maker. He devises a simple, ingenious plan. He grants George’s wish that he had never been born and shows him the town of Bedford Falls (or should we call it Pottersville?) without him. The contrast is striking, and it shakes George out of the doldrums. He is willing to face even the prospect of jail because he is able to compare the world with and without him, and he realizes he has made a positive, profound difference.</p>
<p>I believe this movie offers a wonderful way to view our lives. What if each of us, in our mind’s eye, imagined two pictures that are essentially the same except in one of them we are missing and in the other we are present, and then we asked ourselves, “What’s the difference between the two pictures?”</p>
<p><strong>The Motivation and Ability to Make a Difference</strong></p>
<p>I can’t begin to count the number of times students have come to me over my 29 years at BYU and told me they want to make a difference in the world. Some of them have much larger aspirations to make a difference than capacity—they want to boil the ocean with a camping stove—but others have very clear and viable plans about how they want to add value. I think our basic Christian faith, which is only magnified by our experiences in the Church, expands these desires in all of us. For example, most of us try very hard to embody the lesson taught by the Parable of the Talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man with three servants left on a journey, and before he left, he gave an allotment of talents to each of them based on his perception of their ability (and perhaps, their motivation). To one servant, he gave five talents, to another two talents, and only one talent to the third servant. After a long time, the man returned and asked each of his servants for an accounting. The first servant had turned five into ten talents, and his master congratulated and rewarded him. The second servant turned two into four talents, and his master honored him in exactly the same way as the first servant. When, however, the third servant reported that he had buried his talent, and he tried to justify doing nothing to increase it, his master reprimanded him and took his talent away from him and gave it to the first servant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the talent in the parable is a denomination of money, the lesson for most of us is we should use our God-given talents to make a difference in the world. We believe if we are faithful to that charge that we will receive the divine accolade: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21,%2023?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Matthew 25:21, 23</a>).</p>
<p>At the Marriott School, my academic home, we’ve conducted several studies about how our students are perceived, especially by recruiters from the companies that employ them after they graduate. One of the studies about Marriott School MBA graduates produced this summary Gap Analysis. Basically, recruiter impressions of our MBA graduates’ attributes are reported on a two-by-two matrix based on high/low perceived performance on the job and high/low perceived importance of those attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upper right-hand quadrant is where we find the good news of the study. In the upper corner, for example, we learn that Marriott School graduates: Look for ways to contribute. This confirms what we’ve assumed about our students, but it’s heartening to hear it from these key stakeholders.</p>
<p>In the lower right-hand corner of the matrix, however, is a result that quickly pops our bubble: Graduates can quickly contribute. Remember, this is in the high importance/low performance quadrant. Essentially, what we are being told is our graduates fail to contribute quickly in their jobs. They aren’t hitting the ground running, in other words. Given its importance, this is a big problem. How can our graduates be so good at looking for ways to contribute and, yet, be so bad at contributing quickly?</p>
<p>While both attributes address contributions, one focuses on the desire to make contributions, while the other focuses on our graduates’ ability. There is a clear distinction between their motivation and ability to contribute and make a difference, and both motivation and ability are essential to their success.</p>
<p>I have thought a lot about this issue, but my most valuable insight had nothing to do with the Marriott School’s curriculum and our preparation of students. One day, I wondered to myself what would impair me from contributing quickly in a new job? I realized it probably would have very little to do with my ability and preparation but everything to do with my confidence. Then, I asked myself, “What bolsters my confidence more than anything else, especially in situations that are new, challenging, and uncomfortable?” I do not want to pretend that I am completely absent of pride in my abilities. I’m not. Still, one lesson life has taught me is there are many times when I am plain and simply in over my head. At those times, I feel almost paralyzed until I remember there is another reservoir of talent and ability from which I can draw; there is someone else to whom I can turn. The greatest confidence-builder I know is my faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Every one of us has ability limits. I have them. You have them. We all have them. No matter how much one of us wants to contribute, there are physical, mental, and/or emotional limits to how much we can contribute. Education, for example, can increase our abilities by expanding our knowledge and skills, but it does not completely remove limits to our ability to contribute. No matter how well-trained or educated we are, at some point, all of us will fall short, our abilities will not carry us to the successful completion of a task, and we will fail unless we appeal to the Savior, the Deliverer of us all. And I don’t recommend we exhaust all other options before we appeal to Him. I suggest we continuously appeal to Him so much so that our confidence in Him changes our perspective about what is possible.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that this is where the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to focus—on Him. The gospel of Jesus Christ has always been more about motivation than ability, especially the idea of relying solely on one’s abilities. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is about adding to our limited abilities by accessing a higher power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A father approached Jesus with his son, who suffered from convulsions. The convulsions left the young man with a foaming mouth, and on several occasions, he had fallen into fires or bodies of water as a result of the convulsions. The father did not have the ability to heal his son. In fact, he had already brought his son to Jesus’s disciples, and they had been unable to heal him. Jesus initially asked about how long the boy had been inflicted with the malady, and he was told since childhood. Then, Jesus taught the father a lesson in faith. He said to him, “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.” Then, the father cried out, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/9.17-30?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Mark 9:17-30</a>).</p>
<p>A solution to the perceived problem that Marriott School graduates can’t quickly contribute may have a lot less to do with their training than their faith. This does not excuse the Marriott School from its obligation to offer the best education and training possible. It simply acknowledges that no matter what we do along this line, our graduates will inevitably fall short in some way unless they humble themselves and seek after a higher power. All things are possible to those who believe in Jesus Christ. If you can’t do something on your own, you can still do it but only when you rely on Him. A lesson that can never be taught often enough is that with God, all things are possible. Any level of contribution is available to us through our faith in Jesus Christ. My first lesson for today is this: It is through increased faith in Jesus Christ that we can make the greatest, positive difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making a Difference Together</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please consider a story told by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf at the October 2008 General Conference ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/lift-where-you-stand?lang=eng" target="_blank">Lift Where You Stand</a>"):</p>
<p>“Some years ago in our meetinghouse in Darmstadt, Germany, a group of brethren was asked to move a grand piano from the chapel to the adjoining cultural hall, where it was needed for a musical event. . . . Everybody knew that this task required not only physical strength but also careful coordination. There were plenty of ideas, but not one could keep the piano balanced correctly. . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As they stood around the piano, uncertain of what to do next, a good friend of mine, Brother Hanno Luschin, spoke up. He said, “Brethren, stand close together and lift where you stand.”</p>
<p>“It seemed too simple. Nevertheless, each lifted where he stood, and the piano rose from the ground and moved into the cultural hall as if on its own power. That was the answer to the challenge. They merely needed to stand close together and lift where they stood.”</p>
<p>Here is a wonderful example of making a difference together. With a strong assist from Brother Luschin, this group of brethren was able to accomplish something an individual could not accomplish on his own, unless, of course, you see no humor in this cartoon.</p>
<p>There is an interesting challenge associated with joining together to make a difference. For most kinds of tasks, the capacity of the group exceeds the capacity of any individual, but in the process, we lose individual accountability. To illustrate, let’s tell the Parable of the Talents in a slightly different way. What if the master gathered his servants together, gave them eight talents to share, and instructed them to work together to add further value? Even if together they succeeded spectacularly, wouldn’t it have been more difficult for the returning master to assess their individual contributions? Of course, it would have been. You all know from your experiences with group projects that the individual contributions of group members vary widely. It is frustrating but also a rich learning experience when one or two members do most of the work on a project, and they receive exactly the same grade as members who do very little.</p>
<p>Now consider this question. What bothers you more—the lack of motivation or the lack of ability of underperforming team members? Now, hold your answer for just a moment and let me share an experience. When I was a young faculty member at BYU, a well-known organizational scholar, Professor Jerry Harvey, was invited to speak to our faculty. Professor Harvey shared his research about high-performing work teams, and he disclosed a finding that totally surprised me. He told us that the highest performing work teams almost always have at least one weak member. Invariably, teams with at least one weak member even outperformed teams of all-stars. What was Professor Harvey’s explanation for this counterintuitive result? He concluded that a spirit of altruism, which only manifested itself when teams had at least one weak member, consistently improved team performance because it united and rallied the individual members of the team.</p>
<p>So, returning to my question, what bothers you more—a lack of motivation or a lack of ability of other team members? I’m sure you’ve guessed my answer—a lack of motivation bothers me a great deal more than a lack of ability. Let me argue using the Parable of the Talents that it is highly likely that my view reflects the Lord’s view. The parable teaches that the master allocated resources based on ability, but He rewarded his first two servants the same even when they performed differently. It did not matter that one had an increase of five talents and the other an increase of two talents; they both received the divine accolade and an eternal reward. It was the servant who did nothing and then tried to justify it that received the Master’s wrath and forfeited the talent he had buried. If we read between the lines, it is entirely plausible that if the third servant had tried, even if he had been less successful than the other servants or actually failed, he would have received his Master’s accolade and reward. And even if his reward had been less than the other servants received, he would have been far better off for having tried.</p>
<p>While we all enjoy working on teams with able people, few of us are bothered by underperforming team members when they are trying as hard as they can. In fact, more often than not, they inspire us. One of the beauties of working together to make a difference is we can’t measure our individual contributions with any precision, so we stop worrying about ourselves. We become lost in the joy of accomplishing something as a team.</p>
<p>There are many inspiring groups of people in the Book of Mormon, but I can’t think of a more inspiring image than the people of Alma when he commanded them that “they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:21</a>). In my mind’s eye, what I see is a faithful people hoping together for better circumstances. They are both faithful and hopeful because, as Moroni later taught, these attributes are inseparable (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.41-42?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">Moroni 7:41-42</a>). I suppose hope is magnified when it is shared, for it seems that common hope is far greater than the sum of individual hope. As the story of the people of Alma teaches, miracles happen and heavenly power descends when people’s hearts are knit together in unity, love, faith, and hope. Moreover, the difference they make together is magnified because they spread hopefulness through their inspiring examples. This is today’s second lesson: It is shared hope for something better that brings people together to make a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making a Lasting Difference</strong></p>
<p>One of the great blessings of having faith in Jesus Christ is we believe in the promise of immortality and the blessing of eternal life. These beliefs certainly lengthen our perspective beyond day-to-day demands and even lead us to ponder events in the next life. Our belief in eternal life is perspective shifting, and hopefully, it also helps us focus more on making a lasting difference.</p>
<p>After Jesus fed the 5,000 at Tiberias, many people sought him, and they found Him in Capernaum. Jesus questioned why they were seeking Him. He said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">John 6:26</a>). Then, Jesus tried to teach them to seek things of more lasting value that would help them gain eternal life, but they could not hear Him above the roars of their stomachs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since expectations were not met, there was dissent within the ranks of the followers of Jesus—many murmured and “walked no more with him.” And Jesus asked his Twelve Apostles, “Will ye also go away?” Peter answered, “Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.67-69?lang=eng#66" target="_blank">John 6:67-69</a>).</p>
<p>The Savior also taught about firm foundations that are resistant to erosion (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.24-25?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">Matthew 7:24-25</a>). Something I love about the leaders of our Church is they build buildings to last through the Millennium, and this always begins with a firm and sure foundation. In late 1861, leaders of the Church were devastated when they learned that the foundation stones that had been laid for the Salt Lake Temple were cracked. It was learned that the cause of the problem was too much mortar had been used to fill the gaps between stones. At the time, Brigham Young said, “There are nights when I lay awake for fear that I will never see this temple dedicated.” (When President Young died in 1877, the temple walls were only 20 feet high.) Seeking an answer, President Young went to the temple site, sat on one of the cracked foundation stones, and said, “I will not move from this spot until I know what to do.”</p>
<p>On January 1, 1862, President Young announced the solution—the inadequate foundation would be removed and replaced by one made entirely of granite. The footings would be sixteen feet thick. Brigham Young later said, “I want to see the Temple built in a manner that it will endure through the Millennium.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it’s helpful for all of us to think of ourselves as builders—builders of people. I like to say that the Church, in spite of all its complexity, is a human resources organization. Its mission is to assist in the Lord’s work and glory—bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Moses 1:39</a>). This is the only reason we build temples, chapels, and university buildings—to make a lasting difference in the lives of our brothers and sisters in the Gospel.</p>
<p>We consider our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, to be the chief cornerstone or, according to Psalms and quoted in three of the four Gospels, the “headstone of the corner” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/118.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Psalms 118:22</a>). As already discussed, faith in Jesus Christ and shared hope for a better world are other essential cornerstones for a foundation on which to build up others. And what is the final cornerstone for making a lasting difference in their lives? I believe it is charity, for as both the Apostle Paul and Moroni taught, “Charity never faileth” (1 Corinthians 13:8; Moroni 7:46). Moroni also taught that charity “endureth forever” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47?lang=eng#46" target="_blank">Moroni 7:47</a>). Charity glues our focus on Jesus Christ because it is His pure love. Faith, hope, and charity are blended together as we exercise them through our service to others. This is how we lose our lives for His sake and find them (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Matthew 10:39</a>).</p>
<p>In Matthew 25, where the Parable of the Talents is taught, Jesus also shares the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats. The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, like the Parable of the Talents, is about who will and will not receive an eternal reward. It seems clear that the sheep, or those who are set on the right hand of God, are those who have been charitable. Essentially, they are those who see God in the faces of the least of the children of God and then serve God by serving them. At the conclusion of this parable, the Savior taught, “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">(Matthew 25:40</a>). It is entirely possible that this central message of the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats overlaps with the message of the Parable of the Talents. In other words, the best way to increase our talents is to invest them in charity to others. The way to make the greatest, positive difference is to rescue those who need our help the most.</p>
<p>If we were to place charity with other attributes along a scale that measures their relative importance, it would always be the most important, exceeding even faith and hope, according to the Apostle Paul (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). And so today’s third lesson is the most important: Charity, reflecting the pure love of Christ, tightens our focus on making a lasting difference in others’ lives.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The three keys to making a positive and lasting difference together are three Christ-like attributes: faith in Jesus Christ, hope, and charity. I challenge you to continue to learn more about the Savior and to contemplate Him as the perfect role model of faith, hope, and charity. I promise you that if you truly desire to be like Him and to do His will that your faith in Him will increase, your hearts will be knit together with your brothers and sisters in hope, your capacity will increase to emulate Him and His pure and perfect charity, and, together with others who heed this challenge, you will make a positive and lasting difference. In His holy name, even the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>February 18, 2014<br />Lloyd Baird<br />Professor of Management, Boston University<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning and Aloha! Thank you for inviting us to join you at this great university. It is a pleasure to be here where learning is seen as an eternal pursuit and where we have more tools than the secular world. Let me quote from your learning model:&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Motivated by faith<br />•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Active in the learning process<br />•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Self-directed <br />•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Engaged in meaningful reflection<br />•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Open to changing<br />•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Constantly improving</p>
<p>If we learn how to implement that model, we will be amazed at what and how fast we learn, not only in our academic development but our eternal progression as well. My topic is Preparing to Learn. Let me start by reminding us that learning is the purpose of our existence. I am using the word existence on purpose. In our lexicon, we often use the word pre-existence to describe life with our Father in Heaven before we began our mortal journey. I would like to reframe the connotation. Pre-existence might indicate to others that we did not exist before mortality. We know that is not the intent. We existed before our mortal journey. We lived with a loving Heavenly Father who organized our experiences so we could learn as much as possible. We had personalities, characteristics, and associations. At a certain point, it became important for us to go to the next stage. It was explained we could gain a mortal body and learn from<em> our experiences</em> the principles, practices, and characteristics necessary to continue our progression. We understood the challenges and accepted the opportunity to be guided by the Spirit and learn by study and by faith. I hope you have already read Elder Bednar’s book and articles on “Learning by Faith.”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we chose to come here. We understood the purpose was to continue our learning. Every experience, every interaction, every piece of knowledge can help us progress. It is our choice to see this mortal existence as created to help us learn or to simply worry about how comfortably we can make it through. In the final accounting, what we accomplish is not as important as what we become. What we become will be determined by what we learn, which is greatly determined by how well we prepare to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How We Learn&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Within your learning model, let me suggest four ways of learning, each with advantages and disadvantages. First is transferring knowledge already known. Someone has already written it or knows it and can simply tell and explain to us. Much can be learned by simply paying attention. As the New York Yankees baseball manager Yogi Berra once said, “You can observe a lot by watching.” Simply showing up and paying attention is very helpful, but as we will see, you can improve your preparation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second is discovery. Often, nobody really knows the answer, or they will not tell us, so we will need to search, test, and discover. Some things can be learned by structuring proper experiments and then discovering what happens. Other times, we try to do the best we can, keep what is good and what works, and discard the rest. This leads to the third approach: reflecting.</p>
<p>We are here to learn from our experiences. You start, you try, see what happens, and build on the results. In the real world, with fallible people and imperfect knowledge, we learn by trial and error and trying again. We build on the foundation of what we already have learned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth and often most powerful way to learn is to teach. We can only go so far in our eternal progression by worrying about our progression. At a certain point, we have to start worrying about the progression of others. What do they need to know, where are they in their progression, and how can we help? By teaching and helping others, we are forced to be clear in what we know and how to make it useable by others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transfer, discover, reflect, and teach are all powerful tools for learning, if we are prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Before</strong></p>
<p>Now let us consider how to prepare for each. Disseminating knowledge already known is unfortunately the most common way many students, teachers, professors, managers, and even parents approach their responsibilities to teach and learn. I suggest it is unfortunate because you should be able to gain much knowledge before you ever come to the classroom, the presentation, or the discussion. Gathering knowledge before engaging others, however, comes with a caution. Just because you can find it does not make it true. For example, if you search the Internet on any topic, you have no idea why something is listed or if it is valid. Information technology is so pervasive that you will have to be very cautious where you look and for what. Those who have done it before and know what you are looking for can give you guidance. Let me provide an example of <em>learning before</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I teach in a business school. We commonly use cases to help students learn how to analyze, apply knowledge, and understand the way organizations work. Working with colleagues, I asked a question: Might there be a way of enhancing the case method, so students could come even more prepared? Rather than giving the students the case to prepare for the discussion, we gave them the case and told them it represented a historical perspective. A written case describes the past. Depending on when it is published, it may be 5-10 years in the past. We were using a case about eBay, the online auction and marketing firm. We asked the students to do an analysis using the tools and concepts we were discussing to understand the challenges the firm was facing, to describe the strategy eBay was using, and to delineate the leadership capabilities they needed to implement their strategy. This allowed them to learn how to use and apply concepts and tools already known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we asked them to go on the Internet, find the appropriate blogs, read current financial analyst reports, and do whatever other digging could be done to find out eBay’s current situation. What was their current strategy? How successfully were they implementing it? What leadership capabilities did they need now to be successful? The students had the opportunity to apply the concepts and tools in a new context and think much deeper. Then we asked them to project three years into the future and propose an expansion plan targeting a specific geographic area. They had a chance to apply the tools and concepts a third time in a different context. They not only had prepared by learning and understanding the tools and concepts, they had a very deep understanding because of applying them three times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not suggesting this is the approach everyone should take. I am suggesting we can do much to prepare to learn by gathering and applying knowledge already known before we come to together. Of course, class is valuable for conveying knowledge already known, but it can be much richer if we prepare by using all the means available to learn what we can before we come to together. That way the class can be used to enhance, explore, apply deeper, and gain insight from discussions with others. The same suggestions apply to our preparation for Church activities. Image what Sacrament meeting, Sunday School, or Priesthood and Relief Society would be like if everyone came prepared to learn by already gathering what the scriptures, conference talks, lesson manuals, etc. make available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Church to which we belong and the inspired leaders who direct us are much ahead of what happens in most other academic and organizational situations. If you want to see how <em>preparing to learn</em> before can really work, log onto the Church website and go to the curriculum guide for the Youth Sunday School program. “Come Follow Me” is designed to help students prepare by reading, applying, and developing lesson plans before they come to class. Our challenge is to be actively engaged in “Learning Before.” Remember, if you are guided by the Spirit and learn by faith as well as study, you will not only learn faster but be focused on what is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning by Discovery</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, learning by discovery is a principle of action. You do the best you can and move to action. The only way to learn how to ride a bike is attempting to ride the bike. You can read all you want about how a bike functions and the principles of physics that make it work, but until you get on the bike, you cannot learn how to ride a bike. Certain things just have to be experienced. A good example is Alma’s explanation of the Atonement in Alma 7:</p>
<p>"And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p>And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</p>
<p>Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold this is the testimony which is in me." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">Alma 7:11-13</a>)</p>
<p>In order to succor us properly, the Savior had to experience the challenges of mortality. Certain things simply must be learned by experience. Christ had to learn from his experience. Why should we be any different? The Spirit knoweth all things, so why doesn’t the Lord simply chose to have them revealed? The Book of Mormon is filled with situations where the Lord does not remove burdens but lets people learn from their experience. For example, Alma and his people, surrounded by Lamanites:</p>
<p>"And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">Mosiah 24:15</a>)</p>
<p>Now why would the Lord do that, ease their burdens rather than just setting them free as He did later? Certain things simply cannot be learned by study; we have to have the experience over time. In fact, the purpose of our mortality is to learn from our experiences. I am sure Alma and his people were much stronger and better from having waited on the Lord’s time. So how do you prepare to learn from experiences? The best advice is to go into the experience with a clear idea of what you want to learn. Frame a question, and then pay attention to what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice the key. You have the experience and you pay attention to what happens. It does no good to have experiences and not capture what you learned from them. The key to building knowledge from experience is to ask the question, “What did I learn?” The movie Camelot has a great sequence where Merlin, who is youthening (By that, the writers mean he has lived in the future and is moving towards the present. Thus, he already knows what will be happening. ), decides the best way to help the man who is now King Arthur be clear about his purposes is to have him become a fish and swim with the other fish, learning from his experience. As he does, Merlin asks the question, “What are you learning as a fish?” Arthur’s responds, “Oh not very much. Big fish eat little fish, just like everywhere else; somehow that does not seem right does it?” Then Merlin has him become a hawk and fly high over the land. He asks, “Tell me what you see.” Arthur’s responds, “I see lakes, trees, forest,” and Merlin asks, “Can you see the next county?” Arthur responds that he can, but he cannot see the edges. Merlin asks, “Can you see the edges when you are down here?” Arthur’s responds, “Of course I can, the boundaries are clearly marked.” Again, Merlin asks, “So what do you know as a hawk you did not know as Arthur?” Thus was brought to his remembrance the two foundations of the knights of the roundtable and his purposes as King: <em>Might for right</em>, the strong helping the weak, and <em>one England</em>, not separated by boundaries into fiefdoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me emphasize, experiences are not the best teachers. However, experiences reflected on and learnings consolidated and woven into the actions of the future are the best teachers. Repeating the same thing over and over is not going to lead to progression if there is no contemplation, reflection, and learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of how not to do it is Limhi and the people of the Land of Nephi who were “surrounded on every side” by the Lamanites:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the king because of their afflictions; and they began to be desirous to go against them to battle. And they did afflict the king sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires.</p>
<p>And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of their land.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and drove them back, and slew many of them.</p>
<p>And now there was a great mourning and lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for their brethren. …</p>
<p>And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven back again, suffering much loss.</p>
<p>Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the city of Nephi." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21.6-9,%2011-12?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Mosiah 21:6-9, 11-12</a>)</p>
<p>They dressed in their armor and went to battle three times against the same superior Lamanite forces. Each time, the consequences were more widows and children without fathers and fewer warriors. If it did not work the first time, why did they think it would work the second and third time? It was not until they humbled themselves that they began to learn slowly how to rely on the Lord and “Prosper by Degrees.” Albert Einstein has an interesting definition of insanity: “Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” Do not go forth and have experiences from which you do not learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning by Reflecting</strong></p>
<p>Which leads to a third way of learning. We really do not know something until we have tried it, tested it, and applied it in the context of issues, challenges, and further learning we seek. Capture the learning we can from study and faith, and then use it as the foundation for the next level. That is the main message of Alma in his discourse on faith. It is not a one-time event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</p>
<p>Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge. …</p>
<p>But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28-29,%2041?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Alma 32:28-29, 41</a>)</p>
<p>Learning is a process that takes place over time. The key is reflecting on each step and preparing properly for the next. Scriptures refer to this as “the process of time” or “by degrees.” We learn, apply, figure what else needs to be learned, apply that, and continue the process. That is the way the Lord works with us and the way we should work. An example: I was working with a group of four other professors, each of us teaching a section of the same class. We did a marketing simulation where teams from each of our sections competed with each other over multiple time periods. The computer did the calculations after each run and provided feedback on how successful each team was compared to others. I am not a professor of marketing, but for the teams in my class, I told them to make sure and learn after each round. After each submission, the students took breaks. I told my teams, “After you turn in your submission, do not do what all the rest of the teams are doing. (i.e. take a break, check their smart phones, or get a drink.) Rather, immediately get back together and take 15 minutes to talk about how well you worked together and what you could do to improve, and then take your break.” Every semester, our section took most of the top slots in the rankings at the end of the simulation. It was so consistent that another professor wondered whether I was feeding my teams the answers. No, I was only asking them to learn and improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a caution: Sometimes, we do not understand why the Lord is asking us to do what we are doing. The Lord’s ways are not our ways, so you really need to think, pray, and learn by faith. We need to be on the Lord’s errand and learn along the way. An example: The Lord came to a man and asked him to push against a big rock. Being obedient, he put on his clothes went out and started pushing. He pushed and pushed, but the rock was not moving. After many days, Satan came and suggested he stop. He had been working and sweating long enough, and the rock was not moving. The man agreed and sat down; that rock was simply too big to move. The Lord came by and asked him why he was sitting. The man explained that he tried as hard as he could, but the rock just would not move to which the Lord said, “I did not ask you to move the rock, I asked you to push against the rock. Look, you have lost some of that extra weight, your muscles are getting stronger, and you are out here in the fresh air and are healthier. Push against the rock, and when it is time to move the rock, I will come and help you.” He will help us with our big heavy rocks in His time, but you know what happens once that rock is moved? We have learned, we have progressed, and we get to push against an even bigger rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning by Teaching</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, how do we learn by teaching? It is not until we can synthesize, explain, and help other people apply that we really know something. In our leadership class, we decided to implement the principle and have the students teach each other. We were discussing the purpose and power of leading from a clear vision. We assigned the students a chapter in a popular book on leading from vision and Martin Luther King’s “Letter from the Birmingham Jail.” (He explains in the letter his vision of the context and purpose of the Civil Rights Movement.) Rather than us presenting a lecture, we appointed a “content leader” in each group. In addition to the chapter on “Leading from Vision,” we gave them five pages of historical background on the “Letter.” Then, we asked one person in each group to develop a 15-20 minute lesson plan, to teach the other members of their group the key principles, provide examples, and give explanations of how they could be applied. Each of the students was assigned to prepare by also reading the material. The next week, we stood back as they taught their groups. The presentations were amazing. In fact, they were so good we asked if we could keep copies as the basis for future lectures, applications, and experiences. They learned much more by teaching than we could have ever explained. After presenting the concepts and having a discussion with the Dean, we gave an assignment: Now that you know the principles, pick one and apply it during the next week to help make Boston University a better learning environment. We made arrangements with the Dean for them to send reports directly to him, detailing what they did, what they learned, and what they could do going forward. He responded to their reports. It was so successful that each week we rotated to another “content leader” responsible for teaching. Learn the concept, apply it, discover how it works, reflect on the results, and figure out how to apply it again. Then take the learning and teach it to someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for listening. I hope you understand the concepts, but they will have little impact unless you apply them, reflect on the results, and then build to the next level. In fact, if you really want to learn how to learn, summarize the concepts and tell your parents or colleagues back home how the approach to learning is far different here at BYU–Hawaii than at other academic institutions. Explain the learning model and the many ways to learn. Make sure you are always preparing before and reflecting after any event, class, or discussion. Seniors and juniors, become mentors and help the sophomores and freshmen learn better and faster. In summary, Mahatma Ghandi wrote an autobiography, which he entitled “The Story of My Experiments with Truth.” For him, everything was an opportunity to learn. The best summary of his approach is there is no such thing as failure, only failure to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And do not forget to focus on and learn the most important lessons of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">Matthew 11: 29</a>)</p>
<p>My testimony is that we are not here by accident. You are not here at BYU–Hawaii to gain an education. You are here to lay a foundation on which you can continue learning, leading, and building into the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>February 11, 2014<br />Arthur Hannemann<br />President, Laie Hawaii Young Single Adult 1st Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>There’s a story in the New Testament we are all familiar with about the ten lepers who desired, more than anything else, to be healed from the dreaded disease of leprosy, and after being healed, when only one returned, the Savior was left to ask, “Where are the nine?” Where do you think they, the nine, went? What was more important to them, the nine, at that moment of healing than to follow the one who remembered, the only one of the nine, who returned to remember “He” who made it all possible?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think? Did they, the nine, not remember and were they so quick to forget that just a few seconds ago, they were cursed with the dreaded disease of leprosy? Did they not remember the pain of this terrible disease that had cursed their bodies for years? Did they not remember that this awful disease had left them isolated and alone from loved ones and friends every day, every week, every month, and every year? Did they not remember, and were they so quick to forget, the social pain they experienced, that because of leprosy, they were outcasts from society? And then and only then, when a stranger passed by, our loving Savior, upon hearing their plea for help, paused and turned and took the time for them and offered each one His loving gift of healing. Now, they were clean of this painful, dreaded disease. Their prayers were answered! And now, clean because of Him, they are nowhere to be found, leaving the Savior to ask, “Where are they?” Let me ask you this: Do you think they were so caught up in the excitement of this miracle and their new found life that they simply forgot to remember the “One,” Jesus Christ, who made it all possible? &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a pathetic and sad theme from beginning to end in The Book of Mormon that all of us know all too well, which is this: “Slow to remember, quick to forget.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it that when things aren’t going so well, there is a greater tendency to remember Him? And why is it that when things are going well, there is a greater tendency to forget Him, even Jesus Christ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are we in this area of remembering and forgetting? For example, awakening this morning to another beautiful day in Hawaii, did we take the time to remember Him first, in prayer, before we turned our attention to anything or anyone else? That before going to Facebook or checking our email, Instagram, or Twitter. Did we first remember Him in prayer? Or are we like the nine, who after a blessing is received, like the morning of a new life, and sometimes a long sought for blessing, that once received, we forget Him from whom all blessings flow, leaving the Savior to ask, “Where are they?” Where is she? Where is He? Where are you?</p>
<p>Have you ever been there, feeling sick, feeling lousy, and more than anything in the world you wanted to be healed? Then a prayer was offered, a priesthood blessing given, and then miraculously, you were made well.</p>
<p>You ever been there, where you wanted something so badly that you could touch it, feel it, see it, but you were not quite sure if it was possible to get it? And then, through prayer and fasting, miraculously, what you wanted you got? Do you remember?</p>
<p>Have you ever been there, where you felt your life was upside down, lonely, depressed, and with tears, you offered a prayer and pleaded for help, and then as soon as you said amen, almost at that very moment, the phone rang, and it was just the call you needed? Do you remember? Do you still remember that experience today?</p>
<p>The story of the ten lepers and its conclusion illustrates a very valuable lesson for us all, this very important principle of remembering and forgetting, that after we have knocked and it is opened, after we have asked and it is received, and after we have sought and it is found, did we remember Him? What about months and years later? Do we still remember Him, He who opened, He who gave, and He who found, from whom all blessings flow? Or does He stand alone after the good deed is rendered, because of His endless love for you, asking, “Where are you?”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.11-17?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">Luke 17:11-17</a> reads,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p>
<p>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</p>
<p>And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</p>
<p>And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</p>
<p>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</p>
<p>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said, were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?”</p>
<p>Does he ask the same thing of us after taking the time to listen and to bless? Are we slow to remember and quick to forget?</p>
<p>Have you ever been like the “nine”? Where God has made Himself known to you through an answered prayer but through all the excitement and jubilation, you forgot Him? Like before you came here to BYU–Hawaii, for example, and you put your application in and prayed to your Father above that you would be accepted. Your thoughts were probably, “I will do anything to be accepted!” This is Hawaii!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember? Remember when you met with your bishop to be endorsed as one who is worthy to attend BYU–Hawaii, and you said yes to all the standards, and he signed his name, and you signed yours? And then, your prayer was answered. Do you remember how excited you were when you received your letter of acceptance? And now, you are here at this beautiful school, on this beautiful island among beautiful people with the beauty of the gospel all around you. Now that you are here, do you still remember that day in the bishop’s office? Today, do you still remember the commitment you made that day with your bishop and with He who made this all possible.</p>
<p>Did you remember Him this past Sunday, when your alarm clock went off at 7, to be at sacrament at 8?</p>
<p>Did you remember Him in December with Christmas, shopping, finals, papers to be graded, papers to be read, shopping to be done, a lot going on? Did you remember those families that only you have the responsibility to visit each month as their home teacher or as their visiting teacher? Did you remember?</p>
<p>Did you remember Him last Friday night when you were with that cute girl, a friend, and it was late, after 9:00, when you were about to take that step with her, hand in hand, across Kam highway and on to the beach, into the black dark pit of despair, to be deceived, destroyed, for only a moment? Did you remember?</p>
<p>Did you remember Him as you were searching on the internet doing research, when the temptation to go to a different site of deceptive, disgusting pleasure that would only cheapen your soul and destroy the covenants you made with Him, in regards to the priesthood, the temple, and baptism, appeared? Did you remember?</p>
<p>Did you remember Him the other day when that random person asked for your for help and said that it would only take a few minutes, and you stood there looking at your schedule? Did you remember?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Alma 5:26</a>, we learn, “If ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?” Do you?</p>
<p>There’s a story of a man who is walking alongside a cliff with his friend Jack when he steps on a loose rock, tumbles to the ground, and falls over the cliff. In great despair, he pleads in mighty prayer that somehow, someway, his life is saved, and as he continues his deathly descent, a branch embedded in the side of the cliff catches his shirt, stops his fall, and miraculously saves his life. With his life spared, he looks upward and shouts, “Hey Jack you see that? OMG. This branch saved my life!”</p>
<p>Why at times do we not realize and continue to remember that because of Him, and His goodness and love for you, that because of Him you received that grade? That raise? That job? That acceptance letter to BYU–Hawaii?</p>
<p>Do you remember? And, do you still remember today? Or, have you forgotten?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.1-5?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Helaman 12:1-5</a> explains it this way:</p>
<p>“And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</p>
<p>Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, ... doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</p>
<p>And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</p>
<p>O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</p>
<p>Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!”</p>
<p>Each Sunday we hear and utter silently these words:</p>
<p>“O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Ame.” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/5.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Moroni 5:2</a>).</p>
<p>In the sacrament prayer is the line: “That they do always remember him.”</p>
<p>What do we learn from this verse? That when we do remember Him, and He is with us, and we with Him, we have His spirit and power! His power to overcome sin. His power to endure! When we forget Him, he is no longer with us, and we become weak, powerless! We are weak, with no power, to resist, to move away, to overcome the things of the world! Therefore, there is power in remembering and tremendous, tremendous weakness when we forget, when we forget Him. As we are reminded by Mormon, “Nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Mormon 2:26</a>).</p>
<p>What do you do to always remember Him that you may always have His Spirit to be with you? May I make a few suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember to spend the first hour of your day with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost in companionship, study, and prayer every morning.</strong></p>
<p>Realize, that you can’t microwave spirituality. You can’t read for a few seconds and expect to have a spiritual experience. Or as Bishop Stewart Wolthuis of the LHYSA 1st Stake counsels, “You can’t munch on the scriptures and expect to be full.”</p>
<p>And, you can’t rush your prayers and expect to reach heaven and connect with the Almighty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dedicate the first hour of your day and the first thing you do every morning to Him. Give Him the first hour of the day, and He’ll be with you the next 23. Where you will feel His presence, His love for you, and His strength as you move throughout your day, minute by minute and hour by hour. Remember His words, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when we pray, may we remember <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Enos 1:4</a>:</p>
<p>“And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.”</p>
<p>When the Savior was upon the earth, He taught us how to pray and how to respectfully and lovingly address His Father in prayer, using the words Thee, Thy, Thine, and Thou. Never you, never your, or never yours.</p>
<p><strong>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Read and complete The Book of Mormon twice a year, January to June, July to December.</strong></p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “The Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was called to this position almost five years ago (March 1 will be five), I wrote Elder Christofferson, who set me apart, an email a few weeks after being called and asked him, “Now that a few weeks have passed, what counsel would you give me and the members of our stake?” He simply wrote back, “Read the Book of Mormon.”</p>
<p><strong>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Prepare daily to be clean to receive the sacrament.</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of things you can do to prepare worthily to receive the sacrament each week. Here’s an interesting one. I have been to your dorms and your homes and have seen your walls with posters of surfing, basketball, snowboarding, pretty girls, words that say “Rock ‘n Roll,” and occasionally a picture of the Savior! A thought, what if you had on your wall next to that picture of the Savior these bold words: “I am clean! I am clean to partake of the sacrament of my Savior Jesus Christ this coming Sunday. My hands are clean, my eyes are clean, my ears are clean, my heart is clean, and my mind is clean. Today, I am clean! I will remember Him today!”</p>
<p>What if on your screensaver you had your favorite picture of our Savior Jesus Christ and the words “I am clean”? A screen picture of him on your iPad, laptop, iPhone, tablet to remember Him as you search and use your device and travel through the internet. A picture of Him that you can see numerous times throughout the day to remember Him that you may always have His Spirit to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember Him and have His Spirit to be with you always by being humble and overcoming the sin of pride.</strong></p>
<p>It is impossible to have pride and always remember Him because with pride your main focus and priority will always be about you. We need to be humble!</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.28-29?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:28-29</a>, it reads, “O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</p>
<p>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God."</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson continues with this theme on pride and humility: “Selfishness is one of the more common faces of pride. ‘How everything affects me’ is the center of all that matters” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng" target="_blank">Beware of Pride</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, April 1989).</p>
<p>The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other worldly measuring device against others. In the words of C. S. Lewis, “Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man.”</p>
<p>“What will men think of me?” weighs heavier than “What will God think of me?”</p>
<p>The proud love “the praise of men more than the praise of God” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/12.42-43?lang=eng#41" target="_blank">John 12:42–43</a>).</p>
<p>Pride is a sin that can readily be seen in others but is rarely admitted in ourselves. Most of us consider pride to be a sin of those on the top (see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.42?lang=eng#41" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:42</a>). There is, however, a far more common ailment among us and that is pride from the bottom looking up. It is manifest in so many ways, such as faultfinding, gossiping, backbiting, murmuring, living beyond our means, envying, coveting, withholding gratitude and praise that might lift another, and being unforgiving and jealous.</p>
<p>The scriptures testify that the proud are easily offended and hold grudges (see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.1-3?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">1 Nephi 16:1–3</a>). The proud do not receive counsel or correction easily (see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/15.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Proverbs 15:10</a>, <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/amos/5.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Amos 5:10</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pride limits or stops progression (see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10-11?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Alma 12:10–11</a>). The proud are not easily taught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pride adversely affects all our relationships—our relationship with God and His servants, between husband and wife, parent and child, employer and employee, teacher and student, and all mankind.</p>
<p>Pride fades our feelings of sonship to God and brotherhood to man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The antidote for pride is humility. As Rudyard Kipling put it so well:</p>
<p>“The tumult and the shouting dies;<br />The captains and the kings depart.<br />Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,<br />An humble and a contrite heart.<br />Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,<br />Lest we forget, lest we forget.”</p>
<p>Let us choose to be humble.</p>
<p><strong>5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember Him and have His Spirit to be with you always by baptizing someone by December 31 every year.</strong></p>
<p>“Feed my sheep” are the words of the Master when the Savior taught, “Lovest thou me? … Feed my sheep” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/21.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">John 21:17</a>).</p>
<p>Be engaged in “Hastening the Work of Salvation.” Commit that every year by December 31 you will remember by bringing one person unto Him through the waters of baptism. When this is your goal, you will find yourself praying more, fasting more, studying the scriptures more, thinking of others more, thinking of Him more, and thinking less of you a lot more.</p>
<p>From this past October General Conference, Elder Ballard said, “If every member, young and old, will reach out to just ‘one’ between now and Christmas, millions will feel the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. And what a wonderful gift to the Savior” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/put-your-trust-in-the-lord?lang=eng" target="_blank">Put Your Trust in the Lord</a>," Ensign, October 2013).</p>
<p>As the prophet Joseph Smith declared, “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 18:10</a> states, “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.”</p>
<p>A few weeks ago as a Stake, we were trained by Elder Auna of the Seventy and President Warner of the Honolulu, Hawaii Mission on “Hastening the Work of Salvation.” During the training, Elder Auna gave this advice on how he approaches others about the Church. He will meet someone for the first time, begin a conversation, and then ask them where they are from. When they say where they are from, he then says, “Oh, we have a church there.” Then, inevitably, they will ask, “Oh, what church is that?” Then the discussion begins and an invitation is extended.</p>
<p>Well Dave Fullmer, 1st Counselor in the Sunset Beach Branch, attended that training and decided to put Elder Auna’s advice to the test and follow the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
<p>While driving on the North Shore a few weeks ago, Dave picked up a couple of hitchhikers. They began with small talk until Dave asked, “Where are you from?” One of the two answered, “We’re from Honolulu.” Dave then said, “Oh, we have a church there.” Then according to Dave, there was uncomfortable silence for about 30 seconds. Then one of them asked, “What church is that?” From the discussion that then followed, it was learned that the young man who asked the question was baptized years ago and was lost, and he was now found by Brother Fullmer.</p>
<p><strong>6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember Him and always have His Spirit to be with you as you “Look” to God and live.</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.27-28?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Matthew 5:27-28</a>, it reads, “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</p>
<p>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/2-sam/11.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">2 Samuel 11:2</a> says, “And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.”</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.43?lang=eng#42" target="_blank">D&amp;C 84:43</a>, we are cautioned “beware concerning yourselves,” and may I add this: Brethren of the priesthood, beware at how you look at women. Remember your priesthood, and do not forget the oath and covenant you made with him.</p>
<p>I’m going to say that you can’t look at a woman after viewing pornography and look at her the way God would have you look at her, to be looked at as a daughter of God. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took a group of priests on a surf trip, and while at the beach, there were girls in bathing attire. The bishop said with loving caution to our young priests, as they piled out of the van and onto the beach, “Young men, if you don’t look once you’re not a man! However, if you look twice, you are not a missionary!”</p>
<p>I was having lunch with a client and friend one afternoon. He is married with a beautiful wife and three beautiful children. I noticed that every time a woman would enter the restaurant, he would look over at her and continue looking until she took her seat. Then, this one woman in particular entered, and he looked as she entered and continued to look even after she had sat down. As we talked, he continued to look over at her for seconds at a time, which became very annoying to me, and he sensed my annoyance. He said to me, “Art, don’t tell me you don’t look?” I said, “I do, but I don’t look like that!”</p>
<p>Then he said, “Art, don’t tell me that women don’t come on to you?” I said, “Al, I’ve been married for more than 20 years, and no woman has ever come on to me!” Then he said, “Well women come on to me,” and I said, “Really?” Then he said, with a tone of boastfulness, “Yes! All the time!”</p>
<p>As I drove away after our lunch, I thought about what he said about women coming on to him all of the time, and he had me feeling like I had just been to a dance and no one wanted to dance with me. In fact, I think I even grabbed my rear view mirror and started checking myself out and comparing myself to him, but that was only for a selfish moment, when this thought came to me: “I don’t look for it! I don’t look at women the way he does! I don’t look at women like that.” I have always worked with women my whole career and traveled with women as well. Not once has any woman ever come on to me. I have always let them know from day one that I am Mormon, married, and totally in love with my wife, and we have a thousand kids! Knowing that, I believe they look at me and I them in a very respectful and very professional way. Remember, they are daughters of God. That is the only way to look at them. Remember, if you look at the daughters of God any other way, with impure disgusting thoughts, remember, who their Father is! And remember, God will not be mocked!</p>
<p>I remember another time, while living in California, I was in my office at work and the office manager, very attractive at 30, came into my office, shut the door, sat in front of me, and with tears began to complain to me about her husband. As she cried and complained, I grabbed the phone book and searched for the phone number to the mission office in L.A. I then shared my testimony and put her in touch with the missionaries.</p>
<p>Former president of BYU–Hawaii Eric Shumway shared this story when I was a student here back in 1980, a story about Marion G. Romney that I have always remembered.</p>
<p>“Each morning Elder Romney would drive out of his neighborhood on his way to the Church Office Building and would stop at a stop sign where across the street was a bus stop. And each morning, there at the bus stop was Elder Romney’s secretary, waiting for the bus to take her to the same place as Elder Romney, the Church Office Building. As he would stop at the stop sign, they would look at each other and simply wave, and then he would drive on. No matter the weather, he would simply wave and drive on.”</p>
<p>Brethren be wise! Don’t be deceived, and don’t be foolish!&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we were growing up as boys, my mother would always say to me and my brothers, “Manatua Lou Priestua,” which means, “Remember your priesthood!”</p>
<p>Brethren, always remember the oath and covenant of the priesthood you made with God the Almighty. Do not forget! Remember, God will not be mocked! I have had sisters come to me for advice regarding young men they have become interested in. My advice is simple: “Ask him to tell you about the oath and covenant of the priesthood and where the oath and covenant of the priesthood is found, and if he doesn’t know, walk away!”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.33-44?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">D&amp;C 84:33-44</a> states, “For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</p>
<p>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</p>
<p>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</p>
<p>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</p>
<p>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</p>
<p>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</p>
<p>And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.</p>
<p>Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.</p>
<p>But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.</p>
<p>And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you.</p>
<p>And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.</p>
<p>For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.”</p>
<p>Look to God and live. And remember, He is looking too.</p>
<p>I was interviewing a young man and asked him if he lived the law of chastity. He said yes. I then asked, “Would God, who knows all and sees all, say the same thing?” Humbly, he put his head down, and with tears, he shook his head no.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brethren, remember the oath and covenant of the priesthood you made with your loving Father above. He knows you and loves you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful for you good, powerful young men and the power and authority of the priesthood you hold with respect and honor. I am grateful for your example in living it! We are moved as we see you perform your priesthood assignments, as He would. Once, I went ministering to the home of a young sister and before leaving asked her if she would like a blessing. She kindly said no thank you. “My home teachers,” she said, “were just here and gave me one.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sisters, you too have a responsibility to the oath and covenant of the priesthood as well. Your responsibility is to keep your relationship clean. Do not do anything, sisters, in way of dress, speech, or behavior that would have him, he holds the priesthood of God, bring disrespect and shame to the oath and covenant of the priesthood he made with God or that would bring disrespect and shame to you. Don’t you do it! Remember, to look to God and live! And in the heat of the moment, look to God, and do not look away, and walk away! It’s not worth it! Never is and never will be!</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, when looking to God, you have the wonderful blessing of looking into the future and seeing your eternal family, your beautiful children who will look to you as their father and mother and an honorable priesthood holder or a daughter of God who looks to you as his or her eternal loving companion.</p>
<p><strong>7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remind others to remember Him.</strong></p>
<p>We each have a responsibility to remind those who have forgotten Him to remember Him! Be your brother’s keeper. Keep him or her safe from the things of the world. If you see something inappropriate or out of standard in his or her dorm or room, say something. To say nothing is wrong!</p>
<p>Young sisters, if a young man is about to take advantage of you, remind him of his priesthood and remind him of his testimony of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a sister, new from the mainland and very innocent, who shared with me this story. She had just gotten off work at 9:00 at night when she ran into a young man who she knew and trusted. He invited her for a walk and to show her this really cool place, according to him. When they got to this really cool place, and of course it was dark, he began to take advantage of her, holding her inappropriately. She cried out and said, “Remember the Savior, Jesus Christ, is watching us.” Upon hearing the name Jesus, she said, he stopped instantly, backed away from her, and cried, asking for her forgiveness. She reminded him to remember Him, and he did!</p>
<p>For those who need to be reminded, lovingly and kindly help remind them to remember Him! Do not forget! Remember, you have a responsibility to those who have forgotten Him to help them remember Him, Jesus Christ, so that they may always have His Spirit to be with them.</p>
<p>God bless us as we do so, to always remember Him, that we may always have His Spirit to be with us. May we learn from those in The Book of Mormon that it may be said of us that we always remembered Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>February 4, 2014<br />John Bailey<br />Dean of the College of Human Development<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Aloha! Kia Ora Koutou Katoa. I am grateful for many things today.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’m grateful for Mika and Arihia being here and having something to say about me that is possibly interesting to know. Our extended family of 26 is diverse in every way. Our family has come a long way and grown in ways that we could not have imagined at the time of my proposal to Lorretta – one of the miracles of mortality.</p>
<p>I am thankful to these students from New Zealand who have shared their musical talents with us today. Music indeed is a need of the soul. Kia Ora Kyla, Julliet, Tiana, Ani, and Jacob.</p>
<p>I want to thank my students for their suggestions on what I should talk about. One student said, “You should speak about ways to stay driven in school. We get worn out, and sometimes, we need ways to get our drive back when it comes to school.” I appreciated this comment and pray that what I talk with you about today will do just that. School has been going for four weeks now. Assignments are getting heavier, and exams are coming soon if not already, but you are here today. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to thank President Wheelwright for this invitation, which arrived before Christmas and has consumed us, not just me, for the past seven weeks, day and night, and in many ways. I have not sought this opportunity but rather have tried to avoid it for all of the years I have been here, but in a spirit of repentance, I also pray that this will be an edifying hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p>
<p>Okay, we are in school, so let’s have a quiz. Let me ask you three questions. Give yourself an impulse rating on a scale of 1-NO, 2-MAYBE, or 3-YES.</p>
<p>1 – I have so much in life to be thankful for.<br />2 – If I had to list everything that I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list.<br />3 – I am grateful to a wide variety of people.</p>
<p>Now add up your points. Have you got a total? Check with your neighbor.</p>
<p>If your score is over 6, then while I speak, you can nod your head and mentally say, “Amen!”</p>
<p>If your score is between 4 and 6, you probably should make a list as I speak.</p>
<p>If your score is below 4, you could listen attentively and ask someone after Devotional that has a higher score “What was that all about today? Did I miss something?”</p>
<p>We talk often about virtue and virtues; virtues are moral character strengths that ennoble us. For example, as you all know from your parents, “Patience is a virtue.” Did I quote that just right? Courage, mercy, justice, integrity, respect, compassion, honesty, loyalty, chastity, reverence for God, and spiritual things are also virtues. The knights of King Arthur, that mythical king in early England, were warriors who were always on a quest that required their virtue to obtain success. Sir Galahad said, “My strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure.”</p>
<p>Gratitude, or thankfulness or appreciation, is a virtue. Gratitude is the thinking and expressing and giving of thanks to or for those who have helped us in any way. This encompasses those who have come before us, those who are here now, and even those who will come after us.</p>
<p>The Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you; … And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.17,%2019?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">D&amp;C 78: 17, 19</a>).</p>
<p>Someone has said that we are experts at taking things for granted. We know from the experience of the Savior with the ten lepers that only one returned to give thanks. This tells us that gratitude is an uncommon virtue. G. K. Chesterton said, “When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.”</p>
<p>Having a working “gratitude attitude” keeps us on an even keel from day to day, enabling us to meet the challenges of each day with our wits about us. Gratitude keeps us humble, open, able to think under pressure, and enabled to receive the blessings of heaven. John Milton, the poet who became blind, said, “Gratitude bestows reverence, changing forever how we experience life and the world.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, we are too “whakama” or shy to be grateful, but Piglet, in A. A. Milne’s “Winnie the Pooh,” “noticed even though he had a Very Small Heart, it could hold a rather large amount of Gratitude.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it is hard to maintain an attitude of gratitude, especially when terrible things happen (and I am not talking here about quizzes or examinations). Our body and spirit are our soul, physiologically bound together, so when something of a visceral nature hurts us, whether physical or emotional, we are deeply hurt, and we retract and sometimes react. These experiences cause us to shrink, to withdraw from life, from family and friends, and from God. The great blessing is that gratitude can heal us.</p>
<p>Emilie Parker was one of 20 children who were killed by a shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary School just over a year ago. Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve advised Emilie’s parents to not allow “might have beens” to torment them. Emilie’s mother said, “It’s not as simple as forgiving just one time. [Emilie] missed Halloween and I feel anger building up inside of me and I feel that loss. I have to choose to forgive him again and to grieve and then I have to choose to let it go. So that advice Elder Cook gave me was very beautiful. It gave me the power, the control to let things go because he promised me that it would be okay and promised it would help me. It has been one of the greatest blessings that I’ve had – the power to let things go and be ok with it” (Lois M. Collins, <em>Deseret News</em>, December 10, 2013). Forgiving, grieving, and letting go are precursors to gratitude.</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela, recently the president of South Africa, passed away last December. He spent more than twenty years earlier in his life in a jail because of the laws of a racially prejudiced nation. Of his final release from jail, he said, “As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison” (<em>Long Walk to Freedom</em>).</p>
<p>The blind Helen Keller wrote of her well-known upbringing, “It has been said that life has treated me harshly; and sometimes I have complained in my heart because many pleasures of human experience have been withheld from me. … If much has been denied me, much, very much has been given me” (<em>The Open Door</em>).</p>
<p>A gratitude attitude can heal our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>People&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Great friends help us and strengthen us in the achievements of our lives. <em>Ivanhoe </em>is a story written by Sir Walter Scott about a medieval Saxon knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who returned from the crusades and was imprisoned by his enemies. While in his cell, he hears a battle going on outside, and he asks a companion to describe the battle and the attacker, the Black Knight, who turns out to be his hero and warrior king, Richard, back from the Crusades. After the description is given, Ivanhoe says, “I would endure ten years’ captivity to fight one day by that good knight’s side.” Friends whom we can say this of are ones we need to have and whom we will be eternally grateful for.</p>
<p>Let me give you some examples of great friends whom we can be grateful for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first friend whom I recommend to you is our Heavenly Father. Everything he has given us helps us return to him in the celestial world. His first commandment – thou shalt have no other Gods before me – tells us to keep him as our focal point for that very purpose. The Prophet Joseph Smith told us, “Our heavenly Father is more liberal in His views, and boundless in His mercies and blessings, than we are ready to believe or receive; and, at the same time, is more terrible to the workers of iniquity, more awful in the executions of His punishments, and more ready to detect every false way, than we are apt to suppose Him to be” (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, 257-8).</p>
<p>Doesn’t this sound like a real loving father to you? He loves us, protects us, and forgives us, and when we repent, he remembers our mistakes no more, unlike Satan who never wants us to forget our faults and sins and tries to make sure that no one else forgets them either. Satan is the accuser. Joseph Smith said, “If you do not accuse each other, God will not accuse you” (<em>History of the Church</em> 4:445-6).</p>
<p>Today, many Christians regard us as blasphemers and heretics when we say, “As man now is, God once was; as God is now man may become” (<em>The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow</em>, ed. Clyde J. Williams [1984], 1). But this knowledge gives us real intent when we sing the song “I Am a Child of God.”</p>
<p>We all know the story of the prodigal son. He knew that his father loved him but chose to go his own way until finally, after making such a mess of his life, he humbled himself and returned to his father. The point of the parable is that we all can repent and return to God who will kill the fatted calf to celebrate our return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the, parable the son grew up knowing his father and that his father loved him. Some of us, however, do not know personally in our hearts that our Heavenly Father loves us, but we must know it, or we will not come to Him. If we will prayerfully seek out our Heavenly Father, we can receive a witness that He loves us, and that will be so personal that it will become a sacred part of our lives from then on.</p>
<p>Give Him thanks every day for His care for you, and ask that He prepare the way ahead of you each day that you may succeed that day and finally return to Him.</p>
<p>My second friend I know we are grateful to is our elder brother, our Savior, Jesus the Christ. We know so little of His life as a child, as a teenager, and as a young adult, but two wonderful things about Him we do know are one, He loves and respects our Heavenly Father and always gives Him thanks and reverence, and two, though He grew up reading the many detailed prophecies of His own future suffering and death as written in the Old Testament, yet with courage and commitment, He continued on to complete the Atonement, saying often to others, “Be of good cheer” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/6.50?lang=eng#49" target="_blank">Mark 6:50</a>).</p>
<p>Each Sunday as we take the sacrament, we give thanks and remember “For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, … Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.16,%2018?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">D&amp;C 19:16, 18</a>).</p>
<p>Such a great friend to be thankful for, so much about whom can be said, but better that our appreciation is lived more than said.</p>
<p>My third great friend to be grateful for is the Prophet Joseph Smith. What a happy and positive friend he is. We are so blessed by his life and work that now we can hope and live for celestial glory. We know much about his life but little really about his spiritual education. He said, “Could you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that was ever written on the subject” (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, p. 324).</p>
<p>He knew that because that was his experience. He once said, “‘Brethren, if I were to tell you all I know of the kingdom of God, I do know that you would rise up and kill me.’ Brigham Young quickly [and wisely] arose and said, ‘Don’t tell me anything that I can’t bear, for I don’t want to apostatize’” (<em>Reflections of Parley P. Pratt MS</em> 55).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We read in our scriptures, “Joseph Smith … has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">D&amp;C 135:3</a>). You know, men like Adam, Enoch, Noah, Moses, John the Baptist, Peter, James, John, and Paul, and that is saying something! “He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">D&amp;C 135:3</a>).</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph had some tough times, and during one of them, the Savior reminded him “The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than He?” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">D&amp;C 122:8</a>).</p>
<p>And so what do we learn from Heavenly Father, our Savior, and the Prophet Joseph Smith about our own lives? Do we believe in our own eternal significance? Generally, we usually are not too sure, but we do have our patriarchal blessings, we have the assurance of President Eyring, and we know what God said to Jeremiah: “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). Have we ahead of us great and significant things to do and experience? We do. They may not be easy, but we can do them.</p>
<p>Some days, we will be challenged by the Adversary. Satan presents himself as the god of this world, and we learn from the life experiences of Moses, Job, Jesus, and Joseph Smith that Satan has access to us as a part of this mortal experience. But when we are faithful, with the Savior’s help, we can resist him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phillips Brooks, an episcopal bishop and preacher at Harvard University who lived in the 1800’s, wrote, “You may search all the ages. … You may go through the crowded streets of heaven, asking each saint how he came there, and you will look in vain for a man morally and spiritually strong, whose strength did not come to him in a struggle.”</p>
<p>As I might paraphrase, “When things get tough, the celestial get going.”</p>
<p>Now you also need some close and personal friends. This school is a great place to find some friends whom you will treasure for the rest of your lives as we have.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gifts</strong></p>
<p>Some gifts you might also be grateful for are revelation, the priesthood, and our Brigham Young University–Hawaii.</p>
<p>Revelation is a gift to us from Heavenly Father through the Holy Ghost. You know it when you get it. You have heard and probably made these comments: “I was just thinking,” “I just had a thought,” “Guess what,” “It occurs to me that,” or “I am feeling really good about.” These surges of new thought and feeling come to you like that, don’t they?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When revelations are written, they become our scripture. The Christian world struggles by limiting the scriptures to the Bible as it is now printed and packaged. “No man shall add unto this book,” they say. But for us, because Heavenly Father lives and continues to speak, both to the prophet for the Church and to us personally, the collection called scriptures keeps growing all the time.</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott told us in a recent Conference what President Joseph F. Smith said of our loved ones who have passed on:</p>
<p>“I believe we move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. We are not separate from them. … We live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous for our welfare, and they love us now more than ever. For now they see the dangers that beset us; … their love for us and their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel for ourselves. These impressions we can receive from them should be sacred to us and our families.” (Joseph F. Smith, in <em>Conference Report</em>, Apr. 1916, 2–3)&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is instructive to note that when the children of Israel were led out of Egypt and after 40 years were ready to enter Canaan, Jehovah had given them, through Moses, scriptures beginning with Genesis, and as they went along, they received Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Lehi left Jerusalem, he needed scriptures and his genealogy, so sent his sons back to get them from Laban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the gospel was restored in this latter day, one of the first tasks Joseph had was the translation of the Book of Mormon. We now, in addition, have the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price along with our General Conference talks.</p>
<p>When the lost ten tribes return – they who are not lost to God but lost to men and perhaps lost from God – we are told that they will bring with them their scriptures and their genealogy (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">2 Nephi 29:13</a>).</p>
<p>On our mortal journey, scriptures and genealogy are a necessity for us as children of Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use often words like “luck,” “providence,” “serendipity,” and “coincidence” to explain away the events of our lives that should demonstrate to us that Heavenly Father is interested and engaged in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can know of His interest through feelings received through the Holy Ghost. Hopefully, we learned in our Primary years to recognize answers to our prayers. This is a fundamental “know-how” that we must have because we need to be connected to Heaven to succeed in this second estate. A smart phone just won’t do it.</p>
<p>Now I would like to talk about a great blessing to us all: the priesthood. The Priesthood is a real power that enables things to happen on earth upon the principles of Heaven. When our eldest living child, Arihia, was born, she was in severe distress with the expectation of severe brain damage, as a result of oxygen loss, and death within a few days. With we her parents pleading, begging, and fasting for her life, two of Lorretta’s uncles and I blessed her in her incubator in the intensive care unit and immediately, immediately, there was a profound improvement in her health. Where she vomited milk, she now kept it down. Where she convulsed often, she now relaxed. Where she rejected her mother’s milk, she now accepted it. Where her body was failing rapidly, she now went from strength to strength. Of course, she never did meet the doctor’s items on his Denver development chart, but she lives. And from that time until now, she has been the healthiest of our children and also with no cavities ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our children have grown, many and varied emergencies have occurred from cut legs to broken collar bones as well as school semesters, which have required, first of all, a priesthood blessing. The emergencies have not been taken away, but our ability to overcome and to see Heavenly Father at work through “coincidences” and “providence” has been a wonderful testimony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw a man fall off his motor scooter one day and sustain a really serious head injury, which left him unconscious. A neighbor laid his hands on this man and blessed him. The man immediately began to moan and fight to regain consciousness in response to the call. It was a strong testimony to me of the power and reality of the priesthood. Over my life and on many occasions, I have blessed my wife, our children, our homes, our cats and dogs, and our non-member in-laws, even over the phone. I am the family priesthood “doctor” but always I am open to suggestions on what I should offer as a blessing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As young men in the Church, we are given the Aaronic Priesthood and invited to call on and be involved with the ministering of angels to help meet the needs of the members of the Church. We later receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, which holds the keys of the administering of the Gospel and the knowledge of God. The scriptures tell us that in the ordinances of this priesthood is the power of godliness made manifest (D&amp;C 84:19, 20). We learn about doing God’s work by doing God’s work. This priesthood I hope will be something that you learn to depend on as you go through life. Always keep contact with a worthy Melchizedek priesthood holder.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we also should be really grateful for this school. I know that each of you is somewhat of an adventurer in coming here. About 85 percent of you have travelled very far from home to come here. You need to know that this is a special place. Laie in old times was a place of refuge – almost a holy place. In 1864, when the Church was looking for a place to reestablish their headquarters in Hawaii, William Cluff entertained a daytime vision of Brigham Young who discussed with him that this 6,000 acres was the place. Francis A. Hammond, who was assigned by Brigham Young to come with George Nebeker to Hawaii immediately thereafter to formally purchase land for the Church, had a similar vision. This 6,000 acres of land was subsequently purchased in 1865. In Hawaii, Oahu is known as “the gathering place,” and Laie was certainly to become that for us, at least for part of our lives.</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith, whom I quoted earlier, oldest son of Hyrum Smith, who had spent his youth as a missionary in Hawaii, later in 1885 as an apostle encouraged the members here in Laie to stay on this land with a promise that it would flourish. They had no wells of water. Today, we have five wells, and I am given to understand that the rest of the island would love to have access to them. In 1915, he also dedicated the land for the temple, and after his passing, President Heber J. Grant dedicated the completed temple in 1919. Elder David O. McKay visited in 1921, as our mural at the front of the David O. McKay building shows, and the rest, when he became the President of the Church, is, as they say, history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school has matured over the years. We began in a second-hand army barracks where the North Stake Center is and received our accreditation after a number of years in the new campus built in the middle of a sugar cane field. In the beginning, there were 153 students. When I was first here, we had about 800 students. Now, we have about 2,500 students. We have moved in focus from a private version of a small state university to a fully focused faith-based university where we integrate spiritual and secular knowledge – not just package secular knowledge under a church title.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all blessed to be here, but for you, it is a springboard to the rest of your lives. Please take advantage of it while you are here, and you will look back to thank Heavenly Father for this experience.</p>
<p><strong>You and Me</strong></p>
<p>Today, I have tried to talk about gratitude – what it is and some things that we may be grateful for. I have addressed the nature of Heavenly Father, his Only Begotten Son and our Savior Jesus Christ, and the Prophet Joseph Smith who are wonderful people whom we can be grateful to. We can also be grateful for revelation, the priesthood, and our school, this Brigham Young University–Hawaii.</p>
<p>Now you might think, “My score was between 4 and 7 on the quiz. What are some of the things I could have on my to-do list after today?” Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>1 – Decide to be grateful. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks continuously.”</p>
<p>2 – Express your thanks genuinely from your heart. “‘Thank you’ is a wonderful phrase. Use it. It will add stature to your soul,” said Sister Marjorie Hinckley, wife of our last prophet.</p>
<p>3 – Make contact with people as you talk to them. They are God’s children, as are you. Listen attentively to them and to the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>4 – Each day, take time somewhere privately to pray deeply to our Heavenly Father to give thanks and ask about your special situation and your specific tasks and challenges.</p>
<p>As you do these few things, you will know what to do next. Your life will be enriched and your appreciation of the worth of souls will increase (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng" target="_blank">D&amp;C 18</a>).</p>
<p>You may have heard this poem by Myra Brooks Welch called, “The Touch of the Master's Hand.” I will read some verses.</p>
<p>'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer <br />Thought it scarcely worth his while<br />To waste his time on the old violin, <br />But he held it up with a smile:<br />"What am I bidden, good folks," he cried, <br />"Who’ll start the bidding for me?" <br />"A &nbsp;dollar, a dollar. Then two! Only two? <br />Two dollars, and who’ll make it three?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;<br />Going for three…" But no,<br />From the room, far back, a grey-haired man <br />Came forward and picked up the bow; <br />Then wiping the dust from the old violin, <br />And tightening the loosened strings, <br />He played a melody pure and sweet,<br />As a caroling angel sings.</p>
<p>The music ceased and the auctioneer, <br />With a voice that was quiet and low, <br />Said: "What am I bid for the old violin?" <br />As he held it up with the bow.<br />"One thousand dollars, and who’ll make it two? <br />Two thousand! And who’ll make it three?<br />Three thousand, once; three thousand, twice; <br />And going and gone," said he.</p>
<p>The people cheered, but some of them cried, <br />"We do not quite understand.<br />What changed its' worth?" Swift came the reply: <br />"The touch of the Master’s hand."</p>
<p>It is my testimony that we will find that as we practice gratitude, thankfulness, and appreciation, we will come to realize that this poem is about us in the deepest way, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140128<br><title>Personal Transformations | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>January 28, 2014<br />Fraser Bullock<br />Chairman of the Board for the Polynesian Cultural Center<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Aloha! What a delight it is for me to work with President Grace of the Polynesian Cultural Center. He is a great leader, and I am fortunate to be associated with him and the PCC. I also now get the opportunity to work with President Wheelwright as we collaborate with President Grace to make the PCC a great opportunity for BYU–Hawaii students to not only be employed but also to gain important skills for future careers. President Wheelwright is a wonderful man who always has a smile on his face and is so thoughtful. He is upbeat, positive, and high energy, and I really enjoy being around him. He is a great example to me.</p>
<p>President Grace mentioned in his introduction that I was associated with the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. It was the experience of a lifetime. As part of my endeavors, I wanted to experience the Olympics from the athlete’s point of view, so I have skied parts of the men’s downhill at Snowbasin, the mogul run at Deer Valley, and the slalom and giant slalom runs at Park City. I jumped dozens of times at the freestyle aerials practice facility at Park City—that picture is of me doing a front flyaway. I have taken several runs down the bobsled track, and I really lost my judgment when I decided to do the skeleton.</p>
<p>The skeleton is a sport where you lay on your stomach on a sled, and you go head first down the bobsleigh track. Your face is about two inches off the ice. The first time you go down, you travel at about 60 miles an hour through 15 turns, and some of the turns are close to 90 degrees.</p>
<p>To prepare me to go down the track, they gave me a helmet, shoulder pads, a long liability release form, and some advice: “You really don’t know what you are doing, so just put your head down, look at the ice, and pretend you are a sack of potatoes. Don’t move because you will just mess it up.” They put me on the sled, gave me a push, and very quickly, there was this big drop that accelerated me so quickly I felt like I was shot out of a cannon. It seemed like zero to sixty in three seconds. I realized at that moment that I had mixed emotions: fear and terror. I then came to the first turn—a left-hand turn of almost 90 degrees. I was going close to 60 miles per hour. I hit the side wall of the corner, ricocheted off the wall and hit the other side, and then bounced back and hit the other wall again. I couldn’t see where I was going, just the ice on the track inches from my face. I just got stabilized, and then I hit the next corner with the same ricocheting result. Only 13 turns left to go—I realized this was an experience in survival.</p>
<p>After the longest 60 seconds of my life, I reached the bottom. I was alive. My heart was racing, and I was ever so glad that something had ended. There was an Olympian from Turkey there to help me extract the heavy sled from the track. I told him about my ride and asked him if there was a better way. He said that I could potentially totally change my experience. He told me that I would need to look up from the ice and look down the track to see where I was going. When I came to a left-hand corner, I should turn my head to the left, which would shift my weight enough to steer me through the corner. The same principle applied for right-hand turns. I said, “Okay, let’s try it again!” &nbsp;What was I thinking?</p>
<p>On my next run, I lifted my head up from the ice to look down the track and had a completely different perspective. I could see where I was going and what was coming. After the push and the cannon-ball like acceleration, I saw the first left-hand turn approaching. I turned my head to the left, which shifted my weight, and <em>WHOOSH</em>! I flew through the corner without touching a side. I thought that was amazing, but then I realized I was going even faster. Then I came to a right-hand turn. I turned my head to the right and zipped right through the corner without touching a side. I had similar results all the way down until I got a little high on the last turn and bumped at the bottom. However, it was a completely different experience. I decided to go one last time to see if could beat my time and maximum speed down the track. I was now becoming competitive, of all things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience was completely different in two ways. First, my perspective had completely changed. Instead of looking down at the ice, having no control, and being bumped around, I was looking ahead, seeing what was coming, and taking control of where I was going. Second, I applied learning and energy to transform my driving to a different result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to discuss these two principles: first, having a perspective of where we are going; and second, utilizing personal transformations to change where we are headed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we step back to consider where we are and where we are headed, we can look at many dimensions in our lives, including spiritual, intellectual, physical, and our characteristics. I will highlight two: spiritual and our characteristics.</p>
<p>First, spiritual. Alma, in essence, asks us each to evaluate where we are spiritually. “Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts? ... I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?” &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14,%2019?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">Alma 5: 14, 19</a>). Do we have spiritual habits that build us, or do we have persistent sins that drag us down? Do we desire to change, but never quite get around to it?</p>
<p>Second, what characteristics do we have? Are we who we would like to be? Think of someone you know and admire and someone who inspires you to be better when you are around him or her. What is it about that person that compels admiration? On the other hand, think of someone you know that you struggle to be around. Someone you would unfortunately rather avoid. What is it about that person that engenders discomfort or dislike? Which person would you rather be? I believe we all enjoy being around people who are upbeat, positive, kind, inspirational, loving, who care first for others instead of being self-preoccupied. People who smile! People who seem to radiate the spirit of the gospel.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a few examples from my own experience. &nbsp; The first one on the negative side is someone who was moody, self-focused, and always complaining. Never smiled. Something was always wrong. The second individual was cutting and caustic. Everything I did was challenged or wrong. He pushed me towards negativity, which I didn’t like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, let me share with you two people I know who were the opposite. The first, Paul Anderson, who was my bishop when I lived in California, exuded a spirit of warmth and love. He always had a smile on his face. I knew he really cared about me and loved me. He was kind through and through. He was a personification of charity. He had a deep spiritual strength that emanated from his being. I wanted to be better when I was around him. I wanted to be more like him. The second, Mitt Romney, was my colleague at the Olympics. Mitt was always high energy, upbeat, and inspirational. He is very funny, always laughing. He believes in giving of himself to great causes. He tries to better things around him and in an upbeat, positive way, and he is drop-dead smart. He is fun to be around. Plus, he encourages you to be your best. I loved working with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of these categories of individuals are you most like today? Which of these individuals would you prefer to be like? We can seek personal transformations to become who we would like to be.</p>
<p>As we consider all of the dimensions of who we are, spirituality is the foundation. The Atonement is the power to change, to become better. As we follow principles of righteousness, the Spirit becomes more a part of who we are. Many characteristics we seek are in fact gifts of the Spirit. As we have the Spirit in our lives, it can transform us. Peter highlighted for us many of the gifts of the Spirit or characteristics we can seek. “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.4-7?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">1 Peter 1: 4-7</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>One area I have pursued that I consider both a personal trait and a spiritual trait is to be more kind—as we are encouraged by Peter. Kindness makes society better. It makes us better Saints. It lifts people around us. It makes us feel better as people. It builds a bridge to charity. Every morning when I say my prayers, I ask Heavenly Father to help me be kinder. Then for my evening prayers, I report in after reflecting on how I did that day. You see the pattern to transform? Daily focus, personal accountability, and seeking divine help.</p>
<p>Deep kindness can be considered as a gift of the Spirit. We see a pattern for this in <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Moroni 7:48</a>, the last verse of a great treatise on charity. “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he has bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my particular case, one answer to my prayers has been to receive the assignment to work with the Polynesian Cultural Center. Working with the Polynesians and the great students of BYU–Hawaii is transforming me in terms of understanding the beautiful culture of Polynesia—open, loving, welcoming, and KIND. These create a special feeling, and I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>In summary, it seems like many times, we are preoccupied with the things of the moment—looking down at the ice—and miss the opportunity to look up from the ice to see a longer perspective and where we are headed. Instead, we can take a step back, look up from the ice, and look down the track. Where are we today, and where are we headed? Life is designed to be an experience of improvement, of change, but change is not easy.</p>
<p>In physics, there is a physical law of nature called entropy. Entropy dictates that natural systems, left to themselves, go from a state of higher organization to lower organization. Systems basically deteriorate over time, so structures erode over time, cars break down as they get older, hair gets messed up during the day, and testimonies can erode unless there is new energy injected into the system. Buildings can be remodeled, cars can be serviced, hair can be brushed again, and testimonies can be strengthened through daily spiritual habits. This is why spiritual habits such as scripture reading, prayer, Church attendance, and callings are so essential to our lives. They inject new energy into our spiritual status. Absent them and testimonies can naturally deteriorate, hence the ever-present emphasis on the spiritual basics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fundamentally change something from its current state today requires even more energy, so if we desire to transform in some manner, it requires focused energy and does not randomly happen. Personal transformations can make us better people, more of the people we would like to be, and personal transformations are at the heart of the gospel plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal transformations can come about from two different sources: first, because we decide to make a change, have the will, and then put forth the sustained energy to make the change; or second, they can come about due to external factors that intrude in our lives, many times in the form of a crisis, trial, or challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enos is an example of the first case, someone who exerted his own effort for his personal transformation. “And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens. And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed. … Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.4-5,%209?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Enos 1:4-5, 9</a>). We see the transformation, including the transition of worrying about himself to worrying about others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can make changes as well. We can examine where we are and where we are headed. Where are we spiritually, and are we building the characteristics which will uplift and inspire others? Are we becoming who we want to be?</p>
<p>In the second type of transformation, things occur in our lives that CAN be agents of change if we allow them to do so. When challenging events happen, our reaction determines whether we separate ourselves from God or draw closer to Him. We can either give in to despair and distance ourselves from God, or we can turn to Him, seek His guidance, and see what we can learn and how we can change for the better.</p>
<p>Permit me to talk about one such personal experience. Mitt and I had joined the Olympic effort in early 1999 and were working to make a transformation of the 2002 Olympic preparations. We were working as hard as possible with long days, extensive travel, and tireless energy. My oldest son, Mike, was 18 and away at college. He had some familiar traits of a typical teenager: somewhat self-focused and endeavoring to be popular. After about a year of intensive effort on the Olympics, and two years left until the Olympic Games started, I wrote the following in my journal:</p>
<p>March 3, 2000. This has been the most difficult week of my life. Last Sunday, our son Michael was diagnosed with cancer. I don’t think I have experienced anything so traumatic before. Michael had been exhibiting many symptoms, including loss of appetite, loss of weight, night sweats, coughing, and lethargy. Our neighbor, an ER doctor, recommended a chest X-ray. After the X-ray, the technician said they saw something there and sent him over to Utah Valley for a CT scan. The doctor told us Mike had a growth that filled much of his chest and that it was likely Hodgkin’s, a form of cancer. We felt like we had been hit by a truck. We were very positive toward Mike, and he broke down a little, saying that he was scared. The doctor privately told me the cure rate was about 50%. I drove home and called members of my family, sharing tears, and that was tough. I felt at that moment that I wish it could be me and not my son. I would have done anything to change places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn’t sleep much that night. Everything had changed. We recognized that everything was in the Lord’s hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is now Friday, and I am sitting here in the hospital awaiting the results of the Gallium scan, which will indicate the staging (or the extent) of his cancer. It is very difficult waiting for the results of this final test. So far this week, we have had many ups and downs. Yesterday, we found out his cancer is definitively Hodgkin’s, which is one of the most curable from of cancer. We are certainly grateful for this. As we go through this experience, we are clearly reminded of the importance of the plan of salvation and our complete reliance on the Lord. I have given Mike three blessings this week, and it is wonderful to have the divine power of the Priesthood and see the importance it has in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They found Mike’s left chest cavity filled with fluid, which was the first thing they had to deal with. The tumor filled a great deal of his chest, also surrounding the heart, and was pressing on his wind pipe, causing the cough. This put him in a very delicate situation. They decided to wait until Wednesday for the surgery to do the biopsy. The anesthesiologist met with us and said that given that the tumor was pressing against the air passages and that his lung had recently recovered, the surgery was quite risky because his breathing could shut down. He would have to be operated on sitting up because of these risks. In fact, he said that several other doctors had passed on the anesthesia. Mike went into surgery and did fine.</p>
<p>After Mike came home between treatments, Jennifer and I became his nursing care, flushing his IV lines twice a day, giving him his meds, and I would give him his shots to help his ANC (immunity) counts come back up. One day, Mike had over 20 pills to take. Mike was very thin and continued to lose weight to the point that he got down to 126 pounds (he is 6 feet tall) and was so thin that his eyes became hollow and his voice changed because he had a hard time breathing. He had to take a big breath just to say something. All throughout this, Mike was a great trooper and didn’t complain at all. He would be more concerned about others.</p>
<p>Then the third cycle of chemo hit. The cycles have a cumulative effect and create a downward spiral of impact. He kept getting weaker and weaker. He got so weak during his third cycle that he could barely walk. In fact, Jennifer and I had to carry him up the stairs to bed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, see the transformations.</p>
<p>One of the amazing things has been my wife, Jennifer. She has consistently been completely upbeat, particularly around Mike. She knows she has to lift him up, and she has done a wonderful job. Every once in a while, she shows more of what is down deep inside, and she had the same reaction I did, which was “Why not me instead?” She also has thought deeply of the concept of casting your burdens on the Lord. This has really helped her and me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike has gained a deeper appreciation of mortality and what is really important. He gave his testimony at his friend’s missionary farewell and said something we had never heard before. He said that the night he found out he had cancer, that when he said his prayers, the only thing he could think of was to thank his Father in Heaven for the trial he was to receive because he knew it would make him a better person.</p>
<p>It did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Mike was in Primary Children’s hospital, he would go around in his wheelchair every day to visit his little buddies who also had cancer. One of his buddies, four-year-old Alec, would only talk to Mike and his mother. Alec didn’t make it. Only Mike and one other person from that group made it, which was very, very hard. Mike came away with a tremendous love for children we had never seen before. It has become part of who he is. Now when Jennifer and I go to visit the grandchildren, if Mike is in the building, they all run by us and directly to Mikey. He has developed a kindness and love for children I never see elsewhere to the depth he has. Mike still has periodic health issues and had a close call at New Year’s, but he is different. Mike transformed from a somewhat self-focused high school student to a person who loves and is loved by children.</p>
<p>When external events happen, especially those we would rather avoid, we can seek to use them as schoolmasters to transform us in some way, as happened to Mike. However, we have to have an open and willing heart and the determination to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one of the big challenges—and opportunities—in life is that dismiss external events, we need to have the focus and energy on our own to initiate and work through personal transformations. It requires us to look up from the ice, look down the track to see where we are and where we are going. Instead of being bounced around down the track, WE need to drive where we want go. We read in <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Ether 12:27</a> “And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.”</p>
<p>We see many inspiring examples of personal transformation in the scriptures: Paul, Enos, Alma, Alma the Younger, the sons of Mosiah, &nbsp;King Lamoni, his wife, and much of the Lamanite nation,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are on the ultimate journey of transformation—pre-mortal life, to mortal life, to hopefully eternal life. These are all made possible by Heavenly Father and the Atonement of the Savior. The opportunity to fulfill this ultimate journey of transformation is to make changes and transformations in our lives: to become better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us look up from the ice, see where we are and where we are headed. Let us choose a transformation to make, perhaps overcoming some weakness we have, perhaps something as simple as kindness, accompanied by a warm smile. By making our transformation effort part of our daily prayers, we can seek divine assistance, remind ourselves of our purpose, and hold ourselves accountable. Such transformations can make us happier, lift others around us, and bring us closer to the Lord and make us the people we want to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my prayer and my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140121<br><title>Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>January 21, 2014<br />Kim B. Clark<br />President, BYU–Idaho<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today, and I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to speak to you about the Lord Jesus Christ and the divine call of Joseph Smith to be the prophet of the Restoration. For just a moment, I want you to hold in your mind the image of the First Vision. The boy Joseph is kneeling in the Sacred Grove, speaking with God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. That beautiful image represents the founding moment of the Restoration. It portrays two things each of us needs to know deep in our heart:&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, Jesus Christ is the Beloved Living Son of the Living God. Like His Father, He is a glorious, resurrected being, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, Joseph Smith was called and chosen by the Lord to lead the dispensation of the fulness of times as the great prophet, seer, and revelator of the Restoration. Joseph was divinely called and divinely inspired. He was, in very fact, the prophet of the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We worship Jesus as the Savior and Redeemer. He is the way, the truth, and the life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We honor Joseph as the prophet of the Restoration, as the head of the dispensation of the fulness of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that glorious moment in the Sacred Grove until his last breath, Joseph revealed the Living Christ and the fulness of His gospel to a world starved for the truth. Among all the great prophets who ever have lived on the earth, Joseph occupies a special place. In the words of the 135th section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>“Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gained a testimony of the Prophet Joseph when I was a boy. In the summer of 1960, when I was 11 years old, President David O. McKay dedicated our ward chapel in Salt Lake City. I felt a compelling desire to be at that dedication. I went early and got a seat at the front of the chapel. When President McKay walked down the aisle and up onto the stand, I was a few feet from him. I remember his eyes, his bearing, and his voice. I listened to him speak, and I listened to him pray. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, I knew in my little-boy heart that David O. McKay was the prophet of God. I also knew that there was an unbroken chain linking President McKay to Joseph Smith. My testimony of David O. McKay was a testimony of Joseph Smith and all the prophets in between. Since that day, every time we have sustained a new prophet, I have received that same witness: this is the prophet of God; he stands where Joseph stood.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ called Joseph Smith to be the great prophet of the Restoration. Through Joseph, the Savior restored the fulness of His gospel to the earth, including the holy priesthood, sacred ordinances and covenants, and His true and living church. He gave to Joseph new revelations and power to bring forth the Book of Mormon and other new scripture written by ancient prophets, thus fulfilling a prophecy made by Joseph in Egypt:</p>
<p>“Thus saith the Lord unto me: &nbsp;A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; ... and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word. ... Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written ... shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon testifies of the truth of the word of God in the Holy Bible and illuminates, clarifies, and deepens our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Bible and the Book of Mormon, together with the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, teach us the truth about Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness and the way to salvation and eternal life through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. These scriptures, ancient and modern, come alive in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Through the Restoration, we can know and live the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and enjoy all of its blessings in the Lord’s true and living Church. This is the “marvelous work and a wonder”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> foretold by Isaiah:</p>
<p>“In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This is the work Joseph was called to do: to make the plain and simple truths of the gospel of Christ come alive in the Lord’s true and living church and in us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph did the work the Lord gave him to do. Let me give you two examples. They come from the fourth Article of Faith written by Joseph Smith in 1842:</p>
<p>“We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, the Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to consider first the principles of faith in Jesus Christ and repentance and second the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Faith in Jesus Christ and Repentance</strong></p>
<p>Joseph taught that faith in Christ is a principle of action and power. Our faith is in the love, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. When we act with faith in the Savior to repent of our sins, we see through the eye of faith the glorious, resurrected, living Christ acting with His pure love and almighty power to forgive, heal, and strengthen us. He has that power because of His atoning sacrifice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atonement of Jesus Christ is at the heart of the Father’s plan of salvation. Through His atoning sacrifice and His resurrection, Jesus overcame the consequences of sin and death. He brought to pass the resurrection of all mankind and opened the way to salvation and exaltation for all who act in faith to come unto Him with repentant hearts. Repentance—or the process through which Christ changes our lives and transforms our very nature—is a supernal gift from a loving Father and His Beloved Son.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this passage of scripture, and I love the way the revelations of the Restoration both witness of its truth and deepen our understanding of what it means. The Book of Mormon makes clear that Christ’s love was deeply expressed in His suffering for each one of us and in His gift of repentance and forgiveness. The Atonement of Christ is personal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two examples from the teachings of Book of Mormon prophets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long before the birth of the Savior, Jacob wrote that Christ would “[suffer] the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> The prophet Abinadi used a passage from Isaiah to teach the personal nature of the Atonement. Speaking of Christ, he said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed? Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets ... and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jacob and Abinadi testified that Jesus knows us individually and suffered our pain and the effects of our sins in the Garden of Gethsemane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal nature of the Atonement extends to every aspect of our lives. Jesus chose to experience every temptation, every pain, every sorrow, every moment of despair, every weakness, every mistake, and every infirmity we suffer. He did this so that He would know how to lift and strengthen us through His love and power. Alma taught of the depth of the Savior’s love in these words:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Through Christ’s mercy and grace, we may obtain forgiveness of our sins and be clean and pure before Him. This is a miracle of His redeeming love, which extends to everything that stands in the way of our progress toward becoming more and more like Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atonement of Christ is infinite. The Lord taught the Prophet Joseph that Jesus “descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things.”<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> The power of His Atonement extends to all of God’s children, whether in mortality now or in the world of the spirits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the power of Christ’s infinite Atonement penetrates into, through, and beyond the darkest sins, the deepest addictions, and the very most awful things in mortal life. Except for those who have known a fulness and then choose perdition, His love and His power can change and transform every heart, every mind, every soul, every child of God, no matter what they may have done, no matter how far they may have fallen from the light. If they will come unto Christ, repent of their sins, and keep His commandments, He will heal them and change them and make them His.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These marvelous truths come alive in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is in the Lord’s church that His authorized servants teach these truths by the power of the Holy Ghost. It is in His church that we have access to the ordinances of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost and to sacred ordinances and covenants administered in holy temples by the authority and power of the Lord’s priesthood. It is faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and obedience to those ordinances and covenants that opens to us the redeeming and strengthening powers of the Atonement of Christ and the fulness of the Savior’s love, mercy, and grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I served as a bishop, a woman who had recently moved into our ward came to see me. She told me she had been involved in a very serious sin in her previous ward. She had sought to change her life and obtain the Lord’s forgiveness for a long time. In that meeting, and in every meeting I had with her, I could see in her countenance the pain and sorrow she felt for what she had done. As I worked with her and learned more of her faith and her diligence, the Lord made it very clear to me that He had forgiven her of her sins and changed her heart. She was clean and pure before Him. I called her in and told her what the Lord had told me. I will never forget what happened. She bowed her head and began to weep. After a few minutes, she raised her head. The transformation in her countenance was miraculous. I watched as the Spirit of the Lord descended upon her. Light streamed from her face. She was radiant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Baptism and the Gift of the Holy Ghost</strong></p>
<p>Through this experience and many others, I know that faith in Jesus Christ and repentance are eternal principles that come alive in the Lord’s true church. The same is true of the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus taught Nicodemus that baptism by water and the Spirit are essential to spiritual re-birth and salvation in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>“Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon witnesses of the importance and the truth of these ordinances and illuminates their central role in the plan of salvation. Nephi taught:</p>
<p>“Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow ... your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold ... then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; ... And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ... And now ... I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; ... Wherefore, ye must press forward with a &nbsp;steadfastness in Christ ... if ye ... endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we remain true to the covenants we make, baptism by immersion and the baptism of fire through the Holy Ghost bring us marvelous gifts and blessings in the Lord’s church. These blessings include a remission of sins, membership in the Church, and the sanctifying and strengthening companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost are not the end of one’s spiritual journey; they are the gateway ordinances of salvation. The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph that enduring to the end involves qualifying for the oath and covenant of the priesthood and the ordinances and covenants of the temple, including eternal marriage. These ancient ordinances and covenants have been restored in the Lord’s true church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we receive all the ordinances of salvation and keep the associated covenants, we become heirs to the blessings of the holy priesthood, a place of gathering in Zion, and exaltation and eternal life in an eternal family. We also become heirs to all the sacred responsibilities, duties, and obligations of those ordinances and covenants, including the responsibility to build up the kingdom of God on the earth and to establish Zion in preparation for the Lord’s millennial reign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the grand sweep of these covenant promises and obligations. What begins in baptism continues in the temple with divine promises that are breathtaking in their scope and in their power. They connect us to the ancient prophets, to the great work of the Lord in the earth, and to the Second Coming of the Savior. Yet, I also love the sweet truth that they are very intimate and personal. I have felt this many times in the house of the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once, I sat in a temple sealing room where I saw a young man and young woman sealed for time and all eternity. I knew the young man, and I knew of the path he had traveled. It was a hard path, full of pain and heartache, but the path was also filled with the Lord's tender mercies and His grace. I looked across the room at the young man's mother. I knew of the pain she had felt for her son, and I could see on her face pure joy as tears flowed down her cheeks. I knew also the path the young woman had walked. I knew of her goodness and her great faith that had sustained her in difficult hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I watched this beautiful scene, there came into my mind a thought I knew was from the Holy Ghost. These are the words I felt: “This is why He did it—this is why Jesus went into the Garden and hung on the cross. This is why He suffered crushing agony and gave His life. This is why Jesus descended below all things—so that this young man, so precious in His eyes, and this young woman, so choice, so beloved of Him, could be clean and worthy, healed and whole, sealed forever by His power as husband and wife in the new and everlasting covenant, heirs to all the promises and all the blessings a loving Heavenly Father could bestow.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want you to hold in your mind for just a moment the image of the young man and young woman in the temple of the Lord. Everything about that scene that matters comes from Jesus Christ. They are in the Lord’s house; the ordinance was given by Him; it is His priesthood, His sealing power that joins them forever; the keys of the priesthood that authorize that ordinance are His; it is His atoning sacrifice that cleansed the couple from sin and made possible their entrance into His house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything that matters in that glorious, blessed scene is a reality on earth today because Jesus Christ and His ancient prophets restored to the earth all of these great blessings through the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is with joy that we declare Jesus is the Christ, and Joseph is His prophet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you and I need a testimony, a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer and that Joseph Smith was divinely called to restore the fulness of the gospel of Christ and the Lord’s true Church to the earth. We need to act on that witness to receive sacred ordinances and live the covenants, laws, and commandments in the Lord’s true and living church. If we do, we will experience a deeper and deeper conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ born of resilient faith in the Savior and the ministry of the Holy Ghost. We need that deepening conversion because we live in challenging, even dangerous times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been so since Joseph’s day. From the moment he walked out of the Sacred Grove until the mob murdered him in Carthage Jail, Joseph was persecuted and attacked. The members of the Church were driven from their homes many times, and many were killed. The early Saints also faced the temptations and distractions of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacks on the Prophet Joseph and the Church and its members in our day are more spiritual and subtle but no less deadly. We face a world of growing evil and darkness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is exactly why the Lord called Joseph and why He calls prophets, seers, and revelators today in His true and living church. The Lord said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord called many to support and help Joseph in the great work of the Restoration. One of these was Oliver Cowdery, to whom the Lord said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word’s sake.</p>
<p>... Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love.”<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Oliver was commanded to stand by Joseph faithfully, to defend him and support him in proclaiming the fulness of the gospel of Christ in the world no matter what difficulties might arise. The Lord promised Oliver that if he would stand by Joseph and keep the commandments of God with faith in Christ and with all diligence, the Lord and Savior would stand by Oliver and “encircle [him] in the arms of [His] love.”<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>You may be wondering, would I have defended Joseph and supported him in the dark hours of apostasy in Kirtland? Would I have stood by Joseph in Zion’s Camp, in Missouri, in Liberty Jail, in Nauvoo, and at Carthage? Would I have stood by Joseph through all of that? But those were not our days. Our days are now, wherever we live now. The question is do we stand by Joseph now? Do we bear witness of Joseph as the great prophet of the Restoration? Do we stand by Joseph when people heap ridicule upon him or call him a fraud? Do we stand by Joseph by standing by the living prophet in our day, President Thomas S. Monson? He stands where Joseph stood. We cannot stand by Joseph if we do not stand by the Lord’s living prophet. Do we stand by Joseph by being valiant in the testimony of Jesus and true to the covenants we have made? Are our lives a living witness of the Christ whom Joseph revealed to us in this last dispensation? Is the restored gospel of Jesus Christ alive in us?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Oliver’s call to stand by Joseph is our call and his promise is our promise. I pray that each of us may have a witness that Jesus is the Christ and Joseph is His prophet. I know that if we act with faith in Christ, in all diligence to live that witness, the plain and simple truths of the gospel of Christ will be alive in us. We will stand by Joseph, and the Lord Jesus Christ will stand by us and encircle us in the arms of His love.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> I know that is true. I bear witness of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. I know He lives. And I know that Joseph is His prophet. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sephra Kinikini: "God Is a Perfect Being"</strong></span></p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, Aloha! In the words of the prophet Joseph Smith, “Without the knowledge of all things, God would not be able to save any portion of his creatures; for it is by reason of the knowledge which he has of all things, from the beginning to the end, that enables him to give that understanding to his creatures by which they are made partakers of eternal life; and if it were not for the idea existing in the minds of men that God had all knowledge, it would be impossible for them to exercises faith in him” (<em>Lectures on Faith</em> [1985], 51–52). Brothers and sisters, this is an eternal principle; since we were made in His image, we have the potential to know all that God knows, for God is the God of all truth. We know that truth is having a full understanding of both temporal and eternal truths. As students at Brigham Young University – Hawaii, we are learning temporal knowledge. In order to learn eternal knowledge, we must go to Heavenly Father. We must seek for truth in everything that we learn in this life.</p>
<p>However, sometimes people stop learning after they graduate; sometimes people stop learning about the Gospel after returning home from their full-time missions. Brothers and sisters, we cannot do this. What is the counsel that the prophet Joseph Smith gives in <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19</a>? He said, “Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.” This is a key principle in achieving exaltation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that Heavenly Father has given us a mind with which to reason, to analyze, and to understand like He does. He has guided you to this university to learn so that you may gain knowledge that will change your character. We are to “seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#117" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:118</a>). Pray for the Holy Ghost to help you understand the things that you need to learn in your classes. I promise you that the Spirit will open your mind so that you may understand, and like Heavenly Father, you will be on your way to obtaining this higher learning. My little brother Daniel, has been an example to me of studying by study and also by faith. He is an example of humility and diligence in putting the Lord first and always seeking to learn. He always reminds me that a person’s present circumstance doesn’t determine his or her future success. It only motivates it. That success depends on your attitude to never stop learning both temporal and spiritual things. Do we have this type of motivation towards our studies? Brothers and sisters, we must never stop learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that Heavenly Father only has one motivation, which is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Moses 1:39</a>). President Dieter F. Uchtdorf explains that because of this desire, “He is a God of creation and compassion. Creating and being compassionate are two objectives that contribute to our Heavenly Father’s perfect happiness. Creating and being compassionate are two activities that we as His spirit children can and should emulate” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage?lang=eng" target="_blank">Happiness, Your Heritage</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2008). As such, we can be like Him in these ways: when we are sealed to our eternal companion in Heavenly Father’s holy temples. As we are all descendants of Adam and Eve, we should look to them for an example of fulfilling our creation as co-creators with Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Through revelation, the prophet Abraham learned that after Adam had named all of God’s creations, Adam’s eternal wellbeing was on the brink. “And the Gods said: Let us make an help meet for the man, for it is not good that the man should be alone, therefore we will form an help meet for him” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/5.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">Abraham 5:14</a>). Thus came the complete creation of man. For Adam was not complete until Eve was created. This union between a man and women is a huge reason for our creation. Whether we are single or married at this time, we all share in this divine power. This power is sacred, and I invite all of you to review the words of President and Sister Wheelwright in our last devotional over this sensitive matter. I know that what they said is true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brethren, you can be like Adam by being presiders. To preside is to watch over and care for the needy. We need you to preside as the priesthood holders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We need you, brethren, to faithfully and worthily exercise that power to bless us. We cherish the blessings of comfort, healing, and companionship that only you can give, but also, please remember to treat us with the same kind of respect that you would want the choice woman in your life to be treated. You can fulfill these callings as you rely on the Lord. I’m grateful for my father and two brothers who are worthy priesthood bearers and are great examples of servants of the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sisters, you can also be like Eve by being an help meet. Elder Bruce C. Hafen explains, “The original Hebrew word for <em>meet </em>means that Eve was adequate for, or equal to, Adam. She wasn’t his servant or his subordinate. And the Hebrew word for <em>help </em>in 'help meet' is <em>ezer</em>, a term meaning that Eve drew on heavenly powers when she supplied their marriage with the spiritual instincts uniquely available to women as a gender gift” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/2007/08/crossing-thresholds-and-becoming-equal-partners?lang=eng" target="_blank">Crossing Thresholds and Becoming Equal Partners</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Aug. 2007). Sisters, that gender gift is being a nurturer. A perfect modern example is Emma Smith; the Lord declared to her, “And the office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">D&amp;C 25:5</a>). Being a comfort is like being a friend. Having the spirit of meekness is to be accepting and patient. Remember that being co-creators with God must also be built on the foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The words of the prophet Gordon B. Hinckley can be applied to both men and women in our relationship with our eternal companion. He said, “Aim high, but do not aim so high that you totally miss the target. What really matters is that he [or she] will love you, that he will respect you, that he will honor you, that he will be absolutely true to you, that he will give you the freedom of expression and let you fly in the development of your own talents. He is not going to be perfect, but if he is kind and thoughtful, if he knows how to work and earn a living, if he is honest and full of faith, the chances are that you will not go wrong, that you will be immensely happy” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/10/to-the-women-of-the-church?lang=eng" target="_blank">To the Women of the Church</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2003). We should follow this counsel so that we can experience the happiness that comes through Heavenly Father’s plan. I am so grateful for all of my experiences as a student and in BYUHSA because they have made me realize that Heavenly Father knows what’s best for me to become who I am supposed to be. I simply needed to give my will to Him and all will be well. I bear my witness that Heavenly Father loves us. He will always love us, no matter how much we fall short of His glory. I know that Jesus is His Beloved Son and that through His Atonement we may be as compassionate as He was. I know that we are here to build His kingdom. We will be able to return back to our Heavenly Father with an appreciation for all that we have learned. I say these things in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Raife Campbell: “In the Quiet Heart”</span></strong></p>
<p>My brothers and my sisters, Aloha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of you has blessed the lives of your fellow man through your faithfulness in the gospel, and I thank you as your friend, as your brother, and as your representative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask that the Spirit be present &nbsp;today as we share our testimonies with you all.</p>
<p>Shakespeare once wrote, “What win I if I gain the thing I seek?” This question asks us to evaluate our intents and decisions deeper than the face value, which we often give them. I wish to use this quote to springboard my topic, which I have taken from hymn number 220, “<a href="http://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/lord-i-would-follow-thee?lang=eng" target="_blank">Lord, I Would Follow Thee</a>,” of the standard LDS hymn book, which states, “In the quiet heart is hidden sorrow that the eye can’t see.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I wish to talk about the sorrow that exists in every one of us, and then I want to share some tools to help you overcome what sorrows may exist. I wish to discuss this for the purpose that you cannot fulfill the measure of your creation when weighed down by the sorrows of the heart. We can see how Satan will deform your growth and potentially disable your destiny by simply reminding you of the inflictions of the past.</p>
<p>I have felt the need to talk about this subject because I have visited with a great number of you who have suffered either because of the actions of others or because it was and is self-inflicted. I wish to state that any examples I use will only be of my own personal experiences.</p>
<p>On this earth, there are human beings, people, with names, with dreams, hopes and beliefs, people with visions and potential, people who could change this world and the world of others. Every day, their minds, their hearts, their souls, and their bodies are being manipulated and mistreated. Every day, sorrow upon sorrow is being added into their internal accounts never to be sufficed or equalized. If you think that you are excluded from this number, think again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single one of us in our quiet hearts carries sorrows that the eye can’t see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I ask you, as we seek to support these sorrows, what do we inevitably, ultimately gain?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that in the garden of Gethsemane, our Savior, Jesus Christ, knelt at a tree and took upon himself our transgressions, our weaknesses, and our sins with us in mind and in focus. More importantly and probably the most significant of all, he took upon himself our sorrows. As it states in <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 19:16</a>, “For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent.”</p>
<p>His Atonement means that we need not carry these burdens throughout our mortality. So why do we? Why do we latch on to these internal infernos that destroy us?</p>
<p>Releasing this history is easier said than done. I know. I get that, but it is possible, and it is for this purpose that the Savior did suffer for us: so that we can relent through and by him. It is my prayer that all of us will come to realize that we need not carry this any more. As the Savior invited us in <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Matthew 11:28-30</a> to give unto him all of our burdens that they may be light, he didn’t ask for a portion. He didn’t ask for the majority; he asked for all of it so that your burdens may be light and “ye shall find rest unto your souls.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that the Atonement is the balm of Gilead that will sooth the soul from all abuse and battering that we are encumbered with every day of our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish now to give you a three-step method on how to best utilize the healing forces of the Atonement.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Change your thinking.</strong></p>
<p>Human nature always draws us to focus on the negative because it is so delicious. What we need to do before we can change anything is shift our thinking. Ultimately, if we try to fix a problem using the same mindset that created or supported the problem in the first place, then we will ultimately be doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different results. We need to start focusing our thoughts and training our minds to believe the positive, to focus on that one ray of sunshine that always appears on a rainy day. There will be some days that tears come, and we will have to drink the bitter cup because it will not pass us by. Elder Holland stated, “Drink it and be strong, trusting in happier days ahead” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel?lang=eng#5-10791_000_27holland" target="_blank">Like a Broken Vessel</a>," Ensign, Oct. 2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life will not be easy, and it never was designed to be so, but I testify that the Gospel is the easiest way to live.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Only embrace diamond truth.</strong></p>
<p>Bruce R. McConkie stated, “Truth, diamond truth, truth unmixed with error, truth alone leads to salvation” ("<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=658" target="_blank">The Seven Deadly Heresies</a>," BYU Fireside, Jun. 1980). As you shift your thinking, you need to start embracing eternal diamond truths. Diamond truths are both unchanging and valuable. To define truth, truth is not subjective, it is not circumstantial, and it is not reasoned. Truth is not as you believe it or as we define it, but it is given to us from God, and we accept it.</p>
<p>The TRUTH is that you are a child of God with unmeasurable potential, the only limiting factor being the natural man, an enemy to God, and limiting in the sense that you define your limitations through fear and by the influence of others.</p>
<p>Accept truth and you accept freedom. Accept lies and you will always be in bondage to your own self.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Gain a conviction of self.</strong></p>
<p>My definition of conviction is this: that it is the result of a synergistic relationship between both body and spirit. Conviction is what you gain when your mind accepts what your spirit has been teaching you all along. When the Savior was born, he was born a baby. He was limited to the mortality that we all have to deal with, so for him to be able to complete his destiny and perform the Atonement, he needed to gain an understanding, a testimony, a conviction of who he really was. Following in the footsteps of the Savior is not only gaining a testimony of him but of yourselves as well. “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">John 14:6</a>). “I am a Child of God, and He has sent me here.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gain your conviction, and cultivate it through prayer and study. Fight off the natural man and become what your spirit is trying to teach you about what you always were.</p>
<p>My testimony is that within the quiet heart, there can be conviction and a belief that will trump all gossip and hearsay. As we overcome our sorrows and delete from our souls the deepest of depressions, we will win the strength that we seek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>God bless you all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">John Fisihetau: "Fulfilling the Measure of Your Creation"</span></strong></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>I am humbled to stand before you today to share the feelings of my heart. I will speak on fulfilling the measure of your creation. I pray that the Spirit may enter unto and into our hearts as we seek to be better servants to the Master, our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>As a son or daughter of an eternal royal family, the Lord knows our divine potential. He has a personal plan of salvation for each of us. As students of Brigham Young University–Hawaii, the Lord is preparing you to become his chosen vessels for the rest of your lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean to fulfill the measure of your creation?</p>
<p>The Savior, in speaking about the world, defines it in this phrase: “Therefore, [we] must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that [we] may be prepared for the celestial glory; For after [we] hath filled the measure of [our] creation, [we] shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.18-19?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:18-19</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord is pleading with us to prepare and be clean and pure to enter back into His presence.</p>
<p>How do we do this? How do we fulfill the measure of our creation?</p>
<p>I will share five ways in which to do this.</p>
<p><strong>First, we believe in ourselves and trust God. </strong>At this pulpit, during the commencement of December 2011, Elder Jeffery R. Holland said, “It is incumbent upon us as students, as Latter-day Saints, and as children of God to see the divine potential in ourselves, to believe in ourselves, and to know that with God’s help there is quite literally nothing in righteousness that we cannot become.” He continued, “Take your dreams, take your education, take the love of a whole Church full of people, and go make something of yourself” (“<a href="http://devotional.byuh.edu/media111217holland" target="_blank">The Parable of BYU–Hawaii.</a>” BYUH Commencement, Dec. 2011).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Holland is saying that through our belief in ourselves and our trust in God, we can become all God has intended for us. Elder Richard G. Scott states, “We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day. Righteous character is a precious manifestation of what you are becoming” (“<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/10/the-transforming-power-of-faith-and-character?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Transforming Power of Faith and Character</a>,” &nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that our Father in Heaven chooses to see us as what we can become. Believe that you can do all things in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Second, we should have an assurance that God believes in us.</strong> <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Moses 1:39 </a>declares, “For behold, this is my work and my glory – to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. We are his reason. We are his passion. I testify that he has no private agendas that would pull his attention away from his most prized possession: you, his children. You can put your trust and direct your fervent prayers to him who beckons you to come.</p>
<p><strong>The third way we fulfill the measure of our creation is building faith and testimony. </strong>We learn from the Gospel of John that “this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">John 17:3</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion, just prior to his ascension into heaven, Christ’s disciples asked him when he would restore the kingdom of Israel and usher in the Millennium. It reads, “When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/1.6-8?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Acts 1:6-8</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ teaches us that having a witness or testimony of the gospel is prized above knowing the time of the Millennium.</p>
<p>Listen to Elder Richard G. Scott’s powerful witness of Christ: “Jesus Christ lives. He is our Savior, our Redeemer. He is a glorious, resurrected being. He has the capacity to communicate love that is so powerful, so overwhelming as to surpass the capacity of the human tongue to express adequately. He gave His life to break the bonds of death. His Atonement made fully active the plan of happiness of His Father in Heaven.” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/he-lives-all-glory-to-his-name?lang=eng" target="_blank">He Lives! All Glory to His Name!</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come to know him. By so doing, your anchored faith will give you confidence in the road he has prepared you to travel.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth, we need to be true. </strong>Elder Holland again stated, “Be strong. Be true. Teach quietly, by example if by no other way—and that’s the best way—rather than being taught. You can’t control everyone else’s morals—you’re about to learn that—but you can control your own. You can’t control everyone’s language, but you can control your own. You can’t control everyone’s personal standards, but you can control yours” (“<a href="http://devotional.byuh.edu/media111217holland" target="_blank">The Parable of BYU–Hawaii.</a>” BYUH Commencement, Dec. 2011).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finally, the most important thing we can do to fulfill the measure of our creation is to accept and embrace the enabling power of the Atonement of Christ. </strong>Elder Richard G. Scott states, “There is an imperative need for each of us to strengthen our understanding of the significance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ so that it will become an unshakable foundation upon which to build our lives.” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/he-lives-all-glory-to-his-name?lang=eng" target="_blank">He Lives! All Glory to His Name!</a>,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 2010).</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar teaches us that the grace of the Atonement is the source by which we can fulfill the measure or our creation: “Grace is the divine assistance or heavenly help each of us desperately needs to qualify for the celestial kingdom. Thus, the enabling power of the Atonement strengthens us to do and be good and to serve beyond our own individual desire and natural capacity. … The enabling power of the Atonement of Christ strengthens us to do things we could never do on our own. Sometimes I wonder if … we ever learn to acknowledge our daily dependence upon the enabling power of the Atonement” ("<a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/2012/04/the-atonement-and-the-journey-of-mortality?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Atonement and the Journey of Mortality</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 2012).</p>
<p>The sons of Mosiah in the Book of Mormon knew of the enabling power of the Atonement. They suffered greatly while seeking to serve their brethren the Lamanites but were strengthened by the Lord’s Atonement while on the Lord’s errand. Ammon recalls, “Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Alma 26:27</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that the Lord will provide us with success in our lives as we seek him. He will lift us beyond what we could possibly imagine. His love embodies his actions to purify and sanctify us through his Spirit. I leave you with a poem which embodies how we can fulfill the measure of our creation as a constant reminder to seek him:</p>
<p>“Disturb us, Lord, when<br />We are too well pleased with ourselves,<br />When our dreams have come true<br />Because we have dreamed too little,<br />When we arrived safely<br />Because we sailed too close to the shore.</p>
<p>Disturb us, Lord, when<br />With the abundance of things we possess<br />We have lost our thirst<br />For the waters of life;<br />Having fallen in love with life,<br />We have ceased to dream of eternity<br />And in our efforts to build a new earth,<br />We have allowed our vision<br />Of the new Heaven to dim.</p>
<p>Disturb us, Lord, to dare more boldly,<br />To venture on wider seas<br />Where storms will show your mastery;<br />Where losing sight of land,<br />We shall find the stars.<br />We ask You to push back<br />The horizons of our hopes;<br />And to push into the future<br />In strength, courage, hope, and love.</p>
<p>This we ask in the name of our Captain,<br />Who is Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>(attributed to Sir Francis Drake - 1577)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that through believing in ourselves and trusting in God, having an assurance that he believes in us, and building unshakable faith and testimony in knowing God and His Son, we will find confidence and peace in storms of affliction and gratitude and love in times of plenty. I also bear my witness that by being true to ourselves, others, and God, we will be worthy to enter into the presence of our Father. I testify to each of you that through your reliance on the enabling power of the Atonement of Christ, you will fulfill the measure of your creation, and your joy will be full in Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>January 7, 2014<br />Steven C. Wheelwright and Margaret S. Wheelwright<br />President and First Lady of BYU–Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>SCW: Brothers and Sisters, Aloha! We welcome you to the opening devotional of 2014. We hope that you have enjoyed a wonderful Christmas season and the opportunity to remember and celebrate the birth of our Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSW: And we hope that the start of a new year has provided an opportunity for you to reflect on the bounteous blessings that a loving Heavenly Father and His Son have provided for you. Today, we would like to discuss one of the most important and precious of those blessings – the blessings associated with virtue and moral purity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: Our young brothers and sisters, there is such great power in virtue and moral purity! Its value is priceless!</p>
<p>We read in the Doctrine and Covenants, “Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, … and take upon you my whole armor that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">D&amp;C 27:15</a>).</p>
<p>MSW: And in Paul’s letter to the Ephesians we read, “Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.10-13?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>).</p>
<p>Today we’d like to discuss with you the Lord’s whole armor, that which has the greatest power of protection in these perilous times, even virtue and moral purity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: Because of the sensitive nature of this topic, we have chosen to use a team approach in discussing it. Thus, both of us will share the podium throughout today’s devotional. This is a topic we feel strongly prompted to address for the benefit of all of us at this time and place. We humbly seek the guidance of the Spirit so that each of you might know and feel the things a loving Heavenly Father and His Son would have you receive here today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSW: We also feel strongly that the nature of this topic merits the use of video footage from many of our prophets, so that you can sense and feel their conviction and spirit as they discuss the power and blessings of virtue and moral purity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: We have chosen to organize our message around four essential questions:<br />1-Why is virtue and moral purity so important?<br />2-Why has Satan made this his primary battleground here in mortality?<br />3-What are the blessings of virtue and moral purity?<br />4-How do we put on the “whole armor” so we can secure these blessings?</p>
<p><strong>1-Why is Virtue and Moral Purity so important?</strong></p>
<p>MSW: To understand why virtue and moral purity are so important, we must first acknowledge that marriage, parenthood, and eternal families are central to our Father in Heaven’s plan of happiness. This truth was stated clearly by President Gordon B. Hinckley when in September of 1995, he first read <em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</em>.</p>
<p>VIDEO OF PRESIDENT HINCKLEY</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. &nbsp; ”The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. &nbsp;”We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and its importance in God's eternal plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.” [Hinckley, Gordon B., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/10/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1995.]&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: As we just heard from President Hinckley, our sexual identities and procreative powers are an integral part of our Father in Heaven’s plan. We are His sons and daughters, and we have the potential to become like Him. He has entrusted each of us with a portion of His creative powers and provided specific guidelines on the proper use of those powers within the bonds of marriage as we strive to create an eternal family. Our obedience to those guidelines in the use of that power will determine in large measure whether we will merit additional creative powers in the eternities.</p>
<p>Listen to what Elder Dallin H. Oaks has shared concerning the appropriate use of these procreative powers:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER OAKS&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The power to create mortal life is the most exalted power God has given his children. Its use was mandated in the first commandment, but another important commandment was given to forbid its misuse. The emphasis we place on the law of chastity is explained by our understanding of the purpose of our procreative powers in the accomplishment of God’s plan.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The expression of our procreative powers is pleasing to God, but he has commanded that this be confined within the relationship of marriage. President Spencer W. Kimball taught that ‘in the context of lawful marriage, the intimacy of sexual relations is right and divinely approved. There is nothing unholy or degrading about sexuality in itself, for by that means men and women join in a process of creation and in an expression of love’ (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</em>, ed. Edward L. Kimball, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982, p. 311).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Outside the bonds of marriage, all uses of the procreative power are to one degree or another a sinful degrading and perversion of the most divine attribute of men and women. The Book of Mormon teaches that unchastity is ‘most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost’ (Alma 39:5). In our own day, the First Presidency of the Church has declared the doctrine of this Church ‘that sexual sin—the illicit sexual relations of men and women—stands, in its enormity, next to murder’” (“Message of the First Presidency,” 3 Oct. 1942, as quoted in Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, comp. James R. Clark, 6 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75, 6:176). [Oaks, Dallin H., “Plan of Happiness,” Ensign, Nov. 1993.) [Oaks, Dallin H., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/10/the-great-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng&amp;query=Oaks,+Dallin+H.,+%E2%80%9CPlan+of+Happiness,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">The Great Plan of Happiness</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1993.]</p>
<p>MSW: As stated by Elder Oaks, the use of our God-given procreative powers within the bonds of marriage are an appropriate and important part of God’s plan for each of us. But outside the bonds of marriage, any and all uses of that power are a sinful and degrading perversion of the most divine attribute of men and women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: In other words, our physical bodies and the senses we experience through them are an essential part of Gods plan for us. They are not merely incidental to God’s plan; they are essential to it. In his conference talk of April 2013, Elder David A. Bednar explained more fully the essential role of our physical bodies as we pass through mortality:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER BEDNAR&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Our physical bodies make possible a breadth, a depth, and an intensity of experience that simply could not be obtained in our pre-mortal existence. Thus, our relationships with other people, our capacity to recognize and act in accordance with truth, and our ability to obey the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ are amplified through our physical bodies. In the school of mortality, we experience tenderness, love, kindness, happiness, sorrow, disappointment, pain, and even the challenges of physical limitations in ways that prepare us for eternity. Simply stated, there are lessons we must learn and experiences we must have, as the scriptures describe, ‘according to the flesh’” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">1 Nephi 19:6</a>; <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.12-13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Alma 7:12–13</a>). [Bednar, David A., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/we-believe-in-being-chaste?lang=eng" target="_blank">We Believe in Being Chaste</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May, 2013.]</p>
<p>MSW: Our physical bodies are indeed such a wonderful blessing that they caused all of us gathered at that grand council in Heaven as spirit sons and daughters of God to “shout for joy” when we learned that we would receive a mortal body as a result of God’s plan (see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/38.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Job 38:7</a>). &nbsp;</p>
<p>But precisely because our physical bodies with their procreative powers are such a fundamental and essential element of God’s plan of happiness, God through his living prophets has also provided unequivocal bounds on the use of those powers. Listen further to Elder David A. Bednar as he describes these bounds:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER BEDNAR&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a single, undeviating standard of sexual morality: intimate relations are proper only between a man and a woman in the marriage relationship prescribed in God’s plan. Such relations are not merely a curiosity to be explored, an appetite to be satisfied, or a type of recreation or entertainment to be pursued selfishly. They are not a conquest to be achieved or simply an act to be performed. Rather, they are in mortality one of the ultimate expressions of our divine nature and potential and a way of strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife. We are agents blessed with moral agency and are defined by our divine heritage as children of God—and not by sexual behaviors, contemporary attitudes, or secular philosophies.” [Bednar, David A., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/we-believe-in-being-chaste?lang=eng" target="_blank">We Believe in Being Chaste</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May, 2013.] &nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: We refer to this, the Lord’s standard for virtue and moral purity as the law of chastity – “total abstinence before marriage and full fidelity afterwards” (Kimball,&nbsp;Spencer W.&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1978, p. 105.). It is an undeviating law of God, given to protect and bless us. One of the true keys to happiness in marriage and within our families is adherence to the law of chastity. Contrary to what the world would have you believe, moral purity is not a sliding scale. It is a constant, timeless standard the Lord has set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we follow this law and utilize our sexuality and procreative powers only in a manner and within the bounds the Lord has set, we prepare ourselves to receive all of the blessings of the Plan of Happiness both in mortality and in the eternities. This is precisely why virtue and moral purity are of utmost importance to each of us. But it is also why Satan has chosen to focus his primary efforts on challenging virtue and moral purity in his continuation of the War in Heaven. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2-Why has Satan made this his primary battleground here in mortality?</strong></p>
<p>MSW: While our loving Heavenly Father has a plan for our Happiness and Exaltation, Satan has a plan for our unhappiness and destruction. Through his disobedience, Satan is denied a physical body. As a result, his goal is to have us misuse our bodies because he knows such misuse will result in pain and sorrow and the loss of those blessings so integral to the plan of happiness.</p>
<p>For Satan, the battle for our souls is a continuation of the war in Heaven. Long before any of us came to Earth, Satan and his followers were battling against God’s plan. In that premortal council, our Savior stepped forward and offered to help our Father in Heaven accomplish His divine work. At that stage of the battle, good triumphed over evil. Here in mortality, on a new battleground and with new weapons, Satan and his followers continue to wage a war against righteousness. Again, our Savior has stepped forward to show us the way. Though the warfare continues, the end result of this stage of the battle is as certain as was the first stage. The only question is which side we will end up on; will we triumph with the righteous or fall with the wicked?</p>
<p>SCW: Satan’s most tried-and-true tactic is to attack our bodies, as described in these words by Elder Melvin J. Ballard, over eighty years ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“All the assaults that the enemy of our souls will make to capture us will be through the flesh, because it is made up of the unredeemed earth, and he has power over the elements of the earth. The approach he makes to us will be through the lusts, the appetites, the ambitions of the flesh” (Ballard, Melvin J. “<a href="http://www.lds.org/liahona/1984/09/the-struggle-for-the-soul?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Struggle for the Soul</a>,” <em>Liahona</em>, Sept. 1984.).</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar recently expanded on why Satan is so focused on tempting us to misuse our physical bodies and abandon God’s plan of happiness.</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER BEDNAR</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Because a physical body is so central to the Father’s plan of happiness and our spiritual development, Lucifer seeks to frustrate our progression by tempting us to use our bodies improperly. One of the ultimate ironies of eternity is that the adversary, who is miserable precisely because he has no physical body, entices us to share in his misery through the improper use of our bodies. The very tool he does not have is thus the primary target of his attempts to lure us to spiritual destruction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Violating the law of chastity is a grievous sin and a misuse of our physical tabernacles. To those who know and understand the plan of salvation, defiling the body is an act of rebellion (see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.36-37?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:36–37</a>; <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.34-35?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">D&amp;C 64:34–35</a>) and a denial of our true identity as sons and daughters of God. As we look beyond mortality and into eternity, it is easy to discern that the counterfeit companionship advocated by the adversary is temporary and empty.” [Bednar, David A., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/we-believe-in-being-chaste?lang=eng" target="_blank">We Believe in Being Chaste</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May, 2013.]</p>
<p>MSW: Our prophets have repeatedly warned us about avoiding the many seemingly small but inappropriate activities that Satan knows would inflict misery and spiritual destruction on our souls by entrapping and enslaving us in a web of deceit and infidelity. Listen to the warning and guidance offered by Elder Richard G. Scott concerning our physical emotions:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER SCOTT&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Satan knows that those powerful emotions can be aroused by things you could see, hear, or touch. When stirred, those emotions can be used to lead one to destructive experimentation, then to serious transgressions. He uses pornography through videotapes, movies, magazines, computer images, or contaminated music for this purpose. Close your eyes, ears, mind, and heart to it. Unchecked, it would surely grow unrelentingly from initial curiosity step-by-step to become a raging monster. That demon would wreck wholesome desires, worthy companionship, noble thoughts and acts until it could destroy you. Don’t lift the cover of salacious material in any form, and you will not be captured by it. If you have become entangled in that devastating web, stop immediately and seek help. Ask the Lord to guide you to that help and give you the strength to overcome that addictive habit.” [Scott, Richard G., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/10/the-power-of-righteousness" target="_blank">The Power of Righteousness</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov 1998.]</p>
<p>SCW: What precious and heartfelt advice from one we sustain as a prophet, seer, and revelator. As Elder Scott clearly states, if we will conscientiously and consistently avoid “salacious material in any form,… [we] will not be captured by it.” Even seemingly insignificant and minor compromises regarding our moral purity provide an opportunity for Satan to “poison us by degrees.” Sister Elaine S. Dalton, formerly the General President of the Young Women, recently described this process of being progressively poisoned:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF SISTER DALTON</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Lehonti in the Book of Mormon was well positioned on the top of a mountain. He and those he led were ‘fixed in their minds with a determined resolution’ that they would not come down from the mount. It only took the deceitful Amalickiah four tries, each one more bold than the previous, to get Lehonti to ‘come down off from the mount.’ And then having embraced Amalickiah’s false promises, Lehonti was ‘poison[ed] by degrees’ until he died. Not just poisoned, but ‘by degrees.’&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Could it be that this may be happening today? Could it be that first we tolerate, then accept, and eventually embrace the vice that surrounds us? Could it be that we have been deceived by false role models and persuasive media messages that cause us to forget our divine identity? Are we too being poisoned by degrees? What could be more deceptive than to entice the youth of this noble generation to do nothing or to be busy ever-texting but never come to a knowledge of the truths contained in a book that was written for you and your day by prophets of God—The Book of Mormon?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“What could be more deceptive than to entice women, young and old, you and me, to be so involved in ourselves, our looks, our clothes, our body shape and size that we lose sight of our divine identity and our ability to change the world through our virtuous influence? What could be more deceptive than to entice men—young and old, holding the holy priesthood of God—to view seductive pornography and thus focus on flesh instead of faith, to be consumers of vice rather than guardians of virtue?” [<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/a-return-to-virtue?lang=eng" target="_blank">Dalton, Elaine S., “A Return to Virtue</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 2008]</p>
<p>MSW: It should be abundantly clear to all Latter-day Saints, that outside the bonds of marriage, all uses of our God-given procreative power are a sinful degrading and perversion of the most divine attribute that we have been given as sons and daughters of God. Satan knows this. Thus, Satan has chosen such sins and temptations as the chief battleground in his continued struggle to destroy our happiness and our very souls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satan would have us start down that slippery slope – through what we see, hear, touch and think, so that he might poison us by degrees. As President Henry B. Eyring has taught,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Satan will expand the space that is not safe. He will try every way he can to persuade you that there is no danger in trying to come as close as you can to that dividing line. At the same time, he is trying to persuade people that there really is no line at all. Because he knows that you know it is there, he will say to you, ‘Come close to the line.’” (Elder Eyring,&nbsp;Henry B. "<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=775" target="_blank">Waiting upon the Lord</a>," <em>BYU Devotional</em>, Sept. 30, 1990.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: No wonder the Book of Mormon teaches that unchaste behavior is “most abominable above all the sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Alma 39:5</a>). And no wonder that the First Presidency in our day has declared “that sexual sin – [defined as] the illicit sexual relations of men and women – stands, in its enormity, next to murder” (“Messages of the First Presidency,” 3 Oct. 1942, as quoted in <em>Messages of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>, comp.

<p><strong>3-What are the blessings of virtue and moral purity?</strong></p>
<p>Knowing the eternal importance of our physical bodies to the plan of happiness, and knowing that Satan would pursue every avenue imaginable to entangle and destroy us, a loving Father and His Son have provided us with a host of blessings that enable us to “stand against the wiles of the devil” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:13</a>) to “withstand the evil day” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">D&amp;C 27:15</a>) and emerge victorious. Whatever stage of life you are in, single or married, young or old, there are powerful blessings promised to those who maintain virtue and moral purity. Elder David A. Bednar recently summarized some of these blessings:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER BEDNAR&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“President Marion G. Romney declared, ‘I can think of no blessings to be more fervently desired than those promised to the pure and the virtuous. Jesus spoke of specific rewards for different virtues but reserved the greatest, so it seems to me, for the pure in heart, “for they,” said he, “shall see God” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Matt. 5:8</a>). And not only shall they see the Lord, but they shall feel at home in his presence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“‘Here is … the Savior’s promise: “Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45?lang=eng#44" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:45</a>)’ (“<a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/05/trust-in-the-lord?lang=eng&amp;query=%E2%80%9CTrust+in+the+Lord,%E2%80%9D+Ensign,+1979,+42" target="_blank">Trust in the Lord</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May 1979, 42).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We also are promised that, as we pursue the pathway of virtue, ‘The Holy Ghost shall be [our] constant companion’ (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.46?lang=eng#45" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:46</a>). Thus, living the law of chastity invites some of the greatest blessings men and women can receive in mortality: appropriate spiritual confidence in the presence of family, friends, Church associates, and, ultimately, the Savior. Our innate longing to belong is fulfilled in righteousness as we walk in the light with hope.” [Bednar, David A., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/we-believe-in-being-chaste?lang=eng" target="_blank">We Believe in Being Chaste</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May, 2013.]&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSW: What a wonderful blessing to know that we can have confidence standing in the presence of God. But it is not just the blessings of eternity that come from living the law of chastity and pursuing a life of virtue and moral purity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also a number of important blessings promised in mortality to all who are obedient to these commandments. One of those relates to the blessings that come as a result of the covenants made in the temple, and moral purity is a pre-requisite to obtain those temple blessings. Listen to Sister Dalton as she explains the strength and power that accompany these temple blessings.</p>
<p>VIDEO OF SISTER DALTON</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Virtue [and moral purity] are prerequisite[s] to entering the Lord’s holy temples and to receiving the Spirit’s guidance. Virtue ‘is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards’ (<em>Preach My Gospel</em>, 2004, p. 118.) It encompasses chastity and moral purity. Virtue begins in the heart and in the mind. It is nurtured in the home. It is the accumulation of thousands of small decisions and actions. Virtue is a word we don’t hear often in today’s society, but the Latin root word virtus means strength. Virtuous women and men possess a quiet dignity and inner strength. They are confident because they are worthy to receive and be guided by the Holy Ghost. President Monson has counseled: ‘You be the one to make a stand for right, even if you stand alone. Have the moral courage to be a light for others to follow. There is no friendship more valuable than your own clear conscience, your own moral cleanliness—and what a glorious feeling it is to know that you stand in your appointed place clean and with the confidence that you are worthy to do so’” (Monson, Thomas S., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/examples-of-righteousness?lang=eng" target="_blank">Examples of Righteousness</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May 2008.) [Dalton, Elaine S. “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/a-return-to-virtue?lang=eng" target="_blank">A Return to Virtue</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 2008]</p>
<p>SCW: Clearly, the temple is one of the “appointed places” where we should stand, worthy and confident. There is such great power to be freely had through the temple. It is a place where we can escape the battle for a time and find healing comfort and renewed strength. There is another kind of power also found in purity. This is a unifying power. When obediently reserved for marriage, as commanded, intimacy strengthens our ability to “become one,” as the Lord has commanded us to do. Listen to the counsel of Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in this regard:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER HOLLAND</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In matters of human intimacy, you must wait! You must wait until you can give everything, and you cannot give everything until you are legally and lawfully married. To give illicitly that which is not yours to give (remember, ‘you are not your own’) and to give only part of that which cannot be followed with the gift of your whole self is emotional Russian roulette. If you persist in pursuing physical satisfaction without the sanction of heaven, you run the terrible risk of such spiritual, psychic damage that you may undermine both your longing for physical intimacy and your ability to give wholehearted devotion to a later, truer love. You may come to that truer moment of ordained love, of real union, only to discover to your horror that what you should have saved you have spent, and that only God’s grace can recover the piecemeal dissipation of the virtue you so casually gave away. On your wedding day, the very best gift you can give your eternal companion is your very best self—clean and pure and worthy of such purity in return.” [Holland, Jeffrey R., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity?lang=eng&amp;query=Holland,+Jeffrey+R.,+%E2%80%9CPersonal+Purity," target="_blank">Personal Purity</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1998.]</p>
<p>MSW: One of the greatest blessings the Lord has promised to those who commit and follow a path of virtue and purity is that we will be worthy of the guidance of His Spirit at all times and in all places. There can be no stronger shield to complement our armor than the guidance of the Holy Ghost as we seek to avoid evil and temptations. As summarized by the First Presidency in the booklet, For the Strength of Youth, “[Through virtue and purity,] you will be able to do your life’s work with greater wisdom and skill and bear trials with greater courage” (The First Presidency, <em>For the Strength of Youth</em> (2001).) &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also love the security and safety described by Elder Richard G. Scott as he outlines the blessings and power that come from virtue and purity:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER SCOTT</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Continually bless your life with the power of righteousness. It builds confidence. It engenders trust. It yields enduring, worthy achievement. To be righteous is to seek intently to be obedient to the commandments of God. It is to be clean in thought and act. It is to be honest and just. Righteousness is shown more in acts than in words. A righteous life requires discipline. Discipline is that characteristic which will give you the strength to avoid giving up what you want most in life for something you think you want now. It is a friend, not a harsh taskmaster that makes life miserable. Discipline is easier to acquire when it is rooted in faith in Jesus Christ, when it is nourished by an understanding of His teachings and plan of happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“By making choices consistent with eternal truth, you will develop righteous character and increasing strength to resist temptation. You are assured of the help of God in fulfilling your worthy decisions. You qualify to be led by the Spirit, to choose the correct path. It will warn you of temptations you might not otherwise recognize.” [Scott, Richard G. “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/10/the-power-of-righteousness" target="_blank">The Power of Righteousness</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Nov 1998.]</p>
<p>SCW: As we make choices consistent with eternal truths and in keeping with the laws of God, we deny Satan an opportunity to pick the battlefield. Rather, we make him fight on our terms, where we have the advantage. This is one of the great blessings of avoiding evil and concentrating on activities that strengthen our commitment to virtue and moral purity.</p>
<p>One of the great blessings of the Restoration is that we have living prophets to warn us and counsel us not only on how best to sense danger early and avoid the snares and traps set by Satan but to provide specific insight and guidance on how best to develop and pursue an ever strengthening life of virtue and moral purity. Through our living prophets, the Lord Himself teaches us how to strengthen ourselves and put on His whole armor so that we can have the power of purity to bless our own lives and the lives of those around us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4-How do we put on the “whole armor” so we can secure these blessings?</strong></p>
<p>MSW: The process of securing the blessings and power of virtue and moral purity for ourselves and our posterity are what the scriptures refer to as “putting on the whole armor of God.” &nbsp;Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke recently about the daily, incremental processes that fortify and strengthen that armor:&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER BALLARD</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The Lord has given us specific doctrines and principles that show us how to clothe ourselves in the armor of God so that we can stand against the powers of evil. I have suggested a few ways to incorporate gospel principles into your lives. In most cases, we are not talking about massive changes of behavior. As with chain mail, you need simply to add small, individual pieces of armor each day through prayer, scripture study, focusing on things that matter, and acting in a reverent manner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Let us go forward, keeping the commandments of God and following the admonition of the Apostle Paul:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“‘Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“‘Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil’” (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.10-11?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:10–11</a>). [Ballard, M. Russell. “<a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/07/be-strong-in-the-lord?lang=eng" target="_blank">Be Strong in the Lord,</a>” <em>Ensign</em>, Jul. 2004.]</p>
<p>SCW: What are some of the things that we can do to incorporate gospel principles more fully into our lives and thus add to our armor each day? Certainly, such activities as immersing ourselves in the scriptures on a daily basis can be a source of great power and strength. So, too, is daily heart-felt prayer, seeking the Lord’s guidance in all we do and counseling with Him in all things. Fasting offers the opportunity to gain special strength and power beyond our normal ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And renewing our covenants with him weekly and, where endowed, regular temple attendance can all help. As President Ezra Taft Benson taught, “We must do more than simply remove the negative influences from our lives. We must replace them with righteous activities that fill us with the strength and determination to live as we should” (Benson, Ezra Taft. “<a href="http://www.lds.org/new-era/1988/01/the-law-of-chastity?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Law of Chastity</a>,” <em>New Era</em>, Jan 1988.).</p>
<p>MSW: As we follow the gospel of Jesus Christ and the teachings of His living prophets, we will develop even greater strength of moral discipline and faith in the Atonement, and over time, we will become steadfast in our commitment to virtue and moral purity regardless of the challenges we might face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCW: No one steps into immorality in an instant. The first seeds of immorality are always sown in the mind. This is one of the reasons that the First Presidency has not only counseled but chosen to require that all of those involved in any of the Church’s institutions of Higher Learning – students, faculty and staff – must agree to adhere to the Honor code. Each of the four elements of the honor code – the dress and grooming standards, the standards for academic honesty, the residential living standards, and the standards for continuing ecclesiastical endorsement – are designed to strengthen not only our individual armor but our collective BYU–Hawaii armor. Indeed, when we conform our lives to both the letter and the spirit of those standards, we not only protect ourselves and those around us from evil, but we add to the power of virtue and moral purity on this campus. And that power can further strengthen our ability to learn both spiritual and academic truths, whether single or married, young or old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSW: No matter how hard we try, on occasion, our armor may become damaged and need repair. We need to learn to avail ourselves of the Lord’s plan of repentance. That is the process by which we can become clean. Following such repentance, we can move forward to strengthen ourselves and gain the greater power he has promised all those who humble themselves and follow Him. Unfortunately, some have the impression that a few indiscretions now are no big deal and that they can repent quickly later and move on with a happy life. Speaking to a gathering of Priesthood, but it applies equally to sisters, Elder M. Russell Ballard taught the following on this subject:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF ELDER BALLARD</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Young men, please believe me when I tell you that this scenario is a gross deception by Satan; it is a fairy tale. Sin will always, always, result in suffering. It may come sooner, or it may come later, but it will come. The scriptures state that you will ‘stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God’ (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">Jacob 6:9</a>) and that you will experience "a lively sense of . . . guilt, and pain, and anguish’ (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:38</a>).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“A related misconception is that repentance is easy. President Kimball said that ‘one has not begun to repent until he has suffered intensely for his sins. . . . If a person hasn't suffered, he hasn't repented’ (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</em>, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982, pp. 88, 99). You need only talk to a person who has truly repented of serious sin to understand that the momentary pleasure of an immoral act is simply not worth the pain that always follows.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now, let us consider the grand blessings the Lord has promised those who are obedient to the commandment to be morally clean. You never need to repent of a sin you have not committed. That seems obvious, but I want to emphasize it. Repentance is a great blessing, but you should never make yourself sick just so you can try out the remedy. You are infinitely better to maintain your spiritual health by staying morally clean. If you feel confident in the presence of your parents, peers, and priesthood leaders, you can sense how you will feel when you have the confidence and acceptance of the Savior.” [M. Russell Ballard, "<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power?lang=eng" target="_blank">Purity Precedes Power</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1990.]</p>
<p>SCW: As Elder Ballard states so clearly, we are infinitely better off to maintain our spiritual health by staying morally clean. As we do so, we are then prepared to develop our own personal program for growing in virtue and moral purity – developing a stronger and more complete set of armor – one with no chinks and with multiple layers of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSW: As many of you know, President Wheelwright travels to Salt Lake City regularly to meet with the Board of Trustees, which consists of President Monson and his counselors, a few of the Apostles, and other General Authorities. Upon his return, he regularly shares with me the great love and concern that these inspired leaders have for you, the youth of the noble birthright. We would like to conclude by having you listen to a recent summary and plea to all of us, but especially to you students, from our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, regarding the power and blessings of virtue and moral purity:</p>
<p>VIDEO OF PRESIDENT MONSON</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I turn next to the courage you will need to be chaste and virtuous. You live in a world where moral values have, in great measure, been tossed aside, where sin is flagrantly on display, and where temptations to stray from the straight and narrow path surround you. Many are the voices telling you that you are far too provincial or that there is something wrong with you if you still believe there is such a thing as immoral behavior.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Isaiah declared, ‘Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness’ (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Isaiah 5:20</a>).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Great courage will be required as you remain chaste and virtuous amid the accepted thinking of the times.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In the world’s view today, there is little thought that young men and young women will remain morally clean and pure before marriage. Does this make immoral behavior acceptable? Absolutely not!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The commandments of our Heavenly Father are not negotiable!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">……</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Some years ago another First Presidency made this statement, and your First Presidency today echoes the appeal. I quote: ‘To the youth … , we plead with you to live clean [lives], for the unclean life leads only to suffering, misery, and woe physically,—and spiritually it is the path to destruction. How glorious and near to the angels is youth that is clean; this youth has joy unspeakable here and eternal happiness hereafter. Sexual purity is youth’s most precious possession; it is the foundation of all righteousness’ (First Presidency, in Conference Report, April, 1942.).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“May you have the courage to be chaste and virtuous.” [Monson, Thomas S., “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/may-you-have-courage?lang=eng" target="_blank">May You Have Courage</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May, 2009.]</p>
<p>SCW: Our dear young brothers and sisters, please know that we love you and pray for you. Together we testify of the wonderful truths that we have reviewed here today. We hope that you have felt the love that our chosen leaders have for each of you and that has been manifest in their direct and forthright manner on this most challenging and important subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We testify that Satan is real and that he desires only your unhappiness and destruction whereas your loving Father in Heaven and His Son desire only your happiness and exaltation. We know and testify that the doctrine of moral purity and virtue is one of power and of eternal importance. May each of us increase in our ability and commitment to exercise this power, thereby gaining the blessings of Heaven for ourselves and all of those around us, we pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
