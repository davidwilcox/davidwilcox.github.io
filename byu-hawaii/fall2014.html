<p>November 25, 2014<br />Elder Gene F. Priday<br />Director of the Laie Temple Visitors&#039; Center<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha! It is a pleasure to be with you today. I am grateful for my wife. People ask me how I like serving a mission in paradise. I tell them I’ve been in paradise since I got married. We love Hawaii. We especially love serving at the Visitors’ Center. There is a sacred feeling as we serve on the Temple grounds. I acknowledge the wonderful sister missionaries who serve at the Visitors’ Center. Many of them are in the audience today. These sisters come from many different countries and cultures, yet they have one powerful thing that unites them: their love for Jesus Christ and His restored gospel. We love serving with them. I invite all of you to come to the Visitors’ Center.</p>
<p>I love being on BYU–Hawaii campus – almost as much as I love being on the Temple grounds at the Visitors’ Center. You are an amazing student body! Thank you, President Wheelwright for all that you, the faculty, the administrators, and the support staff are doing to move BYU–Hawaii forward. President, thank you also for this opportunity to speak. I love to be among the youth of the Church. I love your energy, your optimism, your faith. I have heard others say they always feel younger when they spend time with young people. This has always been my experience too.</p>
<p>I have given much thought and prayer and have studied the words of latter-day prophets to help me decide what I could say to you today. I have felt promptings that I should speak on how each of us can truly be happy in our lives. I’ve come to the conclusion that happiness begins by being filled with a thankful heart.</p>
<p>This week, we celebrate a wonderful holiday in the United States – Thanksgiving! I recognize that many of you are from countries other than the United States, so let me explain why we celebrate Thanksgiving in the USA. The first Thanksgiving celebration took place in Plymouth Colony, in present-day Massachusetts, in the year 1621. Settlers had arrived in the country earlier and had endured many hardships. In the fall of 1621, the settlers and Native Americans united to celebrate the harvest. More than 200 years later, President Abraham Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November as a national day of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The Thanksgiving holiday is a time to give thanks for our many blessings. A traditional Thanksgiving in the United States includes gathering with loved ones and having a meal together. The meal is not limited to but generally includes turkey, dressing, cranberry sauce, potatoes, other vegetables, and pumpkin pie for dessert. This will be our first Thanksgiving in Hawaii, so we are anxious to see if it is celebrated differently here. I also associate Thanksgiving with “over-eating” because everything tastes sooo good! One of the events our family always does is to take time for everyone to tell one thing for which they are grateful. That discussion always brings thoughtful reflections by everyone else and even a tear or two.</p>
<p>I’d like to ask you to reflect on what you are thankful for today?</p>
<p>• How have you been blessed?</p>
<p>• What opportunities or challenges have blessed your life?</p>
<p>• Do your “blessings” have to do with health? School? Family? Friends? The Gospel?</p>
<p>I’m sure your answers are varied but each blessing is important!</p>
<p>We, of all people in the world, have much to be thankful for: knowing that we are created in the image of God and that we are His children and that He loves us; the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; our membership in His Church; understanding and applying the Atonement of the Savior in our lives; and that we have a prophet upon the earth today to lead and guide us.</p>
<p>I hope you also count as one of your current blessings the opportunity to attend BYU–Hawaii. This is a unique campus. The leaders of the Church appropriate many tithing dollars to create a physical campus such as this and to provide excellent teachers and administrators—all of which combine to make a sacred, safe place to learn. I hope you are taking the opportunity to be involved in your ward. I encourage you to get involved in clubs, attend the special lectures sponsored by the university or your academic department, and go to the cultural and sporting events. These are all part of your educational experience. You have a very short window of opportunity here at BYU–Hawaii. Soon you will graduate and be gone from campus. Love your time here. Make the most of each learning opportunity so that you will be prepared to serve your fellow men when you leave here.</p>
<p>Think for a moment of someone you know who is truly happy. We’ve all met those who seem to radiate happiness. They seem to smile more than others. They laugh more than others—just being around them makes us happier as well.</p>
<p>What makes them so happy? Is there something we can do to radiate happiness too? I believe there is a relationship between a grateful heart and being happy. What are the keys that will bring happiness into our lives? I have four suggestions that may help.</p>
<p><strong>Open Your Eyes</strong><br /> <br /> The first key to being happy is to open your eyes. As you do so, you will recognize there are many blessings in your life. It is a fact of life that the more we see things, the less we notice them. We must open our eyes and pay attention to the good things happening in our life. We must not take these things for granted! Blessings are happening every single day in our life – if we will just take time to notice them.</p>
<p>Our minds have a marvelous capacity to notice the unusual. However, the opposite is true as well: the more we see the things around us – even the beautiful and wonderful things – the more they become invisible to us. That is why we often take for granted the beauties of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds – even those we love. Because we see these things so often, we see them less and less. Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, have a way of opening their eyes and seeing the wonders and beauties of this world as though seeing them for the first time.</p>
<p>We can see this in the Book of Mormon. Nephi sees things so differently from his brothers Laman and Lemuel. These brothers were on the same journey, in the same sweltering heat, in the same desert wind storms, struggling to get food for their young family, struggling to keep their family moving forward each day, yet they saw things so differently. Nephi – always displayed the “I-will-go-and-do” type attitude while Laman and Lemuel often murmured and complained about what they were required to do. In 1 Nephi 17, you can catch a glimpse of these brothers and their opposite attitudes.</p>
<p>Laman and Lemuel’s view is reflected in these verses: “... we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all&nbsp; things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions. Behold these many years [8 years camping and hiking] we have suffered in the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy. ... And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur and complain against us” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.20,21,22?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">1 Nephi 17:20-22</a>).</p>
<p>Murmur and complain? Yeah. We MIGHT have been happy? Wow!</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nephi said, "... we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness . And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.1-2?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">1 Nephi 17:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>Such a different perspective from these brothers. One murmuring and complaining, the other seeing the blessings!</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was going through a difficult time and was weighed down with the challenges I was facing. About that time, my wife and I were reading the General Conference issue of the <em>Ensign</em> and read President Eyring’s talk where he spoke on gratitude and encouraged members to keep a thankful journal. He counseled us to write in the journal each day the blessings that had come into our lives for that day, so we could look back on them and see the Lord’s hand in our lives. I started by making a list of the blessings in my life. My blessings included my wife, our children and their spouses, our grandchildren, my parents and my wife’s parents, my brothers and sisters and their families, my wonderful friends – these were easy to include. Then I recognized the way the Holy Ghost had inspired me about how to help a person I was working with, I was grateful to have a calling in the Church to serve others, I was grateful that I lived close to a temple and could go there often. I was thankful for the fresh clean air to breath, my health, four seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall), our garden with fresh fruits and vegetables, a warm home, prophets on the earth, the Savior, and His Atonement. My “Thankful List” list kept growing. My problem was the things I’d just mentioned were common things, but I wasn’t seeing them! Once I focused on my many, many blessings, life became much easier for me! The problems that weighed me down didn’t go away, but those problems seemed much smaller, and I was able to see things from a different perspective – a perspective founded on gratitude. My whole attitude on life changed. I came to know just how near our Father in Heaven really is and just how much He desired to bless me and my family.</p>
<p>I quote from the hymn “<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/count-your-blessings?lang=eng" target="_blank">Count Your Blessings</a>”:</p>
<p>“Are you ever burdened with a load of care? <br /> Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear? <br /> Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,<br /> And you will be singing as the days go by.”<br /> (<em>LDS Hymns</em>, 241)</p>
<p>Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact—not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those around us – our family and friends.</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf said, “We sometimes think that being grateful is what we do after our problems are solved, but how terribly shortsighted that is. How much of life do we miss by waiting to see the rainbow before thanking God that there is rain?” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/04/grateful-in-any-circumstances?lang=eng" target="_blank">Grateful in Any Circumstances</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May 2014).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we need to recognize the Lord’s hand in our life – every day. We have much to be thankful for. When we open our eyes and truly recognize the blessings coming to us, we will be much happier and live in thanksgiving daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Show It!</strong></p>
<p>Once we truly open our eyes and recognize the blessings we have received, then the second key to being happy in our life is to show it! We show our gratitude with our attitude. Yes! Gratitude begins with attitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult to even imagine a resentful person who is grateful or a grateful person who is resentful.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, “Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. It expresses itself in ugly egotism and frequently in wanton mischief. ... Where there is appreciation, there is courtesy, there is concern for the rights and property of others. Without it, there is arrogance and evil” (“With All Thy Getting Get Understanding,” <em>Ensign</em>, August 1988).</p>
<p>I believe that many people are unhappy because they have not learned to be grateful. Some people carry the burden of bitterness and resentfulness for many years. Others are unhappy because life didn’t turn out the way they thought it would.</p>
<p>“If only I had money, then I could be happy.”</p>
<p>“If only I were better looking.”</p>
<p>“If only I could get through the semester with A’s.”</p>
<p>“If only I had a car, a college degree, a job, a wife, or if I was a few inches taller, or a few pounds lighter.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we will only look around us, there are a thousand reasons for us not to be happy. It is easy to blame our unhappiness on things we lack in life. The problem is the more we focus on the things we don’t have, the unhappier and more resentful we become, and we become ungrateful people and forget about all that we have been given. Attitude is so important.</p>
<p>In the <em>For the Strength of Youth</em> pamphlet, it says, “Live with a spirit of thanksgiving and you will have greater happiness and satisfaction. … Even in your most difficult times, you can find much to be grateful for.”</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon prophet Moroni witnessed the entire destruction of the Nephite nation. He was hunted by the Lamanites. If the Lamanites were to find him, they would have killed him, yet Moroni remained optimistic as he reminded us of the importance of gratitude. He said, “... remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts” (Moroni 10:3).</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson has taught, “We can lift ourselves, and others as well, when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude. If ingratitude be numbered among the serious sins, then gratitude takes its place among the noblest of virtues” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1992/04/an-attitude-of-gratitude?lang=eng" target="_blank">An Attitude of Gratitude</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May 1992).</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was diagnosed with lung cancer! Cancer is a very scary thing. The doctor informed me that the cancer had attached to one of the lobs of my lung. He was concerned that the cancer might also be attached to the aorta. He recommended immediate surgery. I asked myself a few times, “Why me?” I was serving as a bishop at the time, and I had just retired and was looking forward to some time with my wife, our children, and our grandchildren and to serving another mission. Why was this happening to me? Prior to the surgery, I was given a priesthood blessing by my three sons and son-in-law. It was humbling to hear the words spoken in that blessing, reminding me that the Lord was aware of me and my situation and that I should put my trust in Him. I didn’t know then, or for some time in the future, if I would be healed or not, but I realized I was in the Lord’s hands, and I put my trust in Him. The surgery went well, and my recovery was complete. I testify that I felt the Lord’s hand every step of the way through my surgery and recovery. As you go through trials, you can feel the Lord’s sustaining influence too.</p>
<p>The earth and all of its creations—everything—belongs to God. He has ownership and blesses us with His possessions—even the gift of life. Yet, I sometimes find myself thinking about what I created, what I purchased, or what I own, such as my home, car, food, clothing, and my health. However, in reality, I have created nothing; I own nothing!</p>
<p>King Benjamin clearly understood this principle of God’s ownership and our indebtedness to Him, as he so beautifully explained in the Book of Mormon: “And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him. And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast? (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.23-24?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:23-24</a>).</p>
<p>King Benjamin also said (and I’m paraphrasing) that if we were to muster up all of the thanks and praise we could possibly give, that it would still be insufficient given the multitude of blessings we receive from God. King Benjamin was not saying, “Well, you can’t possibly thank God for what He has given you, so why even try?” On the contrary, I believe he was saying that we ought to do our very best in rendering our heartfelt thanks to Him every day of our lives.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, no matter our circumstances, no matter our challenges or trials, there is something in each day to embrace and cherish. Those who live with an attitude of gratitude are usually among the world’s happiest people. As we have an attitude of gratitude, it radiates from us like sunshine and helps lift others and makes them happy as well.</p>
<p><strong>Regularly Offer Prayers of Thanksgiving</strong></p>
<p>This brings me to the third key to being happy: regularly offer a heart-felt prayer of thanksgiving. I emphasize the importance of offering the heart-felt prayer “regularly!” Prayer is a time to talk privately and openly with Heavenly Father. Pour out your heart to Heavenly Father. He loves you. He wants you to talk to Him. You are His precious child. You are created in His image. He truly wants you to be happy! He wants you to return to live with Him again. He wants to bless you now. He said, “This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). That is His greatest desire!</p>
<p>The Bible Dictionary says this about prayer: “The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them” (“Prayer,” <em>Bible Dictionary</em>, p. 753)</p>
<p>I’m reminded of the story told of a man working on the roof of his home who suddenly lost his footing and began to slide down the roof, fully expecting to fall to the ground far below. He quickly offered a prayer asking the Lord to help him when his pants caught on a protruding nail on the roof and stopped him quickly. He stopped his pleading with the Lord and said, “Never mind, Lord. I’ve taken care of it myself.” We generally are very good at asking the Lord for help but are not so good in recognizing His help or His blessings and thanking Him for His help. He is helping us more than we often realize.</p>
<p>President Howard W. Hunter said, “If prayer is only a spasmodic cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and we come to think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our emergencies. We should remember the Most High day and night – always – not only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately need help” (<em>The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter</em>, p. 39).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what help are you seeking in your life? Just as important, what help have you recently received? Prayer is a perfect time to talk to Heavenly Father and to acknowledge His help and to thank Him for all He has done to help us.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley taught, “The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries – we place our order and then hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another” (<em>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</em>, p. 469).</p>
<p>Don’t get up off your knees too quickly. Wait patiently and ponder what He would have you do. Your morning prayer is a time to review what is going to happen in your life today and to seek Heavenly Father’s help. The end of the day is time to report to Heavenly Father about what you accomplished during the day. An important part of both morning and evening prayers is to thank Heavenly Father for all His many blessings that He has given you.</p>
<p>I saw a post on Facebook recently that said, “It’s funny because we ask God to change our situation not knowing He put us in the situation to change us.”</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said, “There is a tendency for us in our prayers and in our pleadings with the Lord to ask for additional blessings. But sometimes I feel we need to devote more of our prayers to expressions of gratitude and thanksgiving for blessings already received. We enjoy so much.”&nbsp; (<em>God, Family, Country</em>, p. 199).</p>
<p>I hope you will have a spirit of thanksgiving in all you do and say. Take time to thank Heavenly Father each day for your blessings. As you consistently express gratitude in your prayers, you will be blessed with a spiritual confirmation that Heavenly Father really loves you. He is aware of you. He is there to support you. It will surprise you what the Lord has done.</p>
<p><strong>Look for Opportunities to Serve Others</strong></p>
<p>The fourth key to being happy in your life is to look for opportunities to serve others! As you pray, ask Heavenly Father to guide your footsteps to those in need. We have been taught when you lose yourself in the service of others, you find yourself. In the process of helping others, you quickly forget about your own worries and you come to love those whom you serve. I’ve witnessed missionaries leave their homes and go to places around the world and truly love the people they serve. They see the good in them. They see the Lord’s hand in the lives of the people they serve. They spend time loving, encouraging, and lifting them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our great hymns reminds us of our obligation to serve others:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I have been given much, I too must give.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of thy great bounty Lord each day I live<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall divide my gifts from thee, with every brother that I see<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then shall my thanks be thanks indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I have been blessed by thy great love, dear Lord. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll share thy love again, according to Thy word. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall give love to those in need; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll show that love by word and deed: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus shall my thanks be thanks in deed.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/because-i-have-been-given-much?lang=eng" target="_blank">Because I Have Been Given Much</a>,” <em>LDS Hymns</em>, 219)</p>
<p>And how do we render thanks unto God? King Benjamin told us how: “And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:17</a>).</p>
<p>Watch this short video on serving others:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXNoRDDoXSQ" target="_blank">Mormon Channel: “Unselfish Service”</a></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, every time we cheer another’s heart, every time we ease another’s burden, every time we lift a weary hand, we show our gratitude to Heavenly Father for all that we have and all that we are.</p>
<p>There are people all around us who are struggling or going through a difficult time – you may be the only person who knows about their struggles and can help them. Sister Linda Burton, General President of the Relief Society, recently spoke on serving others. She said, “First observe, then serve!” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/first-observe-then-serve?lang=eng" target="_blank">First Observe, Then Serve</a>" General Conference, October 2012). That is a good motto for each of us.</p>
<p>There are people needing encouragement that only you can give. In the spirit of being grateful for your blessings, reach out and be an angel to someone who needs your help. Ask Heavenly Father in prayer whom you can serve today. The Spirit will guide you to that person. The blessings that come from serving others are among the choicest this earth has to offer!</p>
<p>In closing, I quote our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. He said, “To express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/10/the-divine-gift-of-gratitude?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Divine Gift of Gratitude</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, November 2010)</p>
<p>I began my talk today by posing a question for each of you to consider: How can we be happier? I have given you four keys to unlock that happiness in your life. I hope you will ponder these suggestions and see how they might apply in your life.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we are blessed in countless ways. Make this Thanksgiving the very best one so far! Every day is a new day. A new opportunity. Choice blessings are there for us if we live in thanksgiving every day. “He who receiveth all things with thankfulness,” the Lord has promised, “shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea more” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">D&amp;C 78:19</a>). Don’t wait to start. Open your eyes, be filled with an attitude of gratitude, regularly give thanks to our Father in Heaven for His many blessings He has poured out upon you, and look for opportunities to serve others. This is my prayer for each of us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>November 18, 2014<br />Gregory P. Gonsalves<br />President of the Kauai Hawaii Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>It is an honor to be with the students, faculty, and staff of BYU–Hawaii this morning. I’d like to thank President and Sister Wheelwright for this special opportunity to speak to you. I would like to thank my wife for that that lovely introduction. I am truly blessed to have had her at my side through 22 years of marriage. I first attended BYU–Provo 25 years ago and cherish the foundation of gospel living that was established in my life by attending devotionals like this. I hope that taking you away from your studies for this time will be a blessing for each one of you. To some degree, I envy the position you are in. It’s exciting to be young, full of life, and looking forward to a life full of dreams. Laie is a special place for my family. My parents both attended the Church College of Hawaii in the 1960s and after they married, raised their seven children on Kauai where many of us live today. I have been serving as stake president on Kauai for more than six years, and it has been a tremendous blessing to provide spiritual leadership for the people on our island. I hope that my message today will inspire and motivate all of us to become better disciples of our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We live in a world that is so divided with numerous differences and philosophies. There are countless ways of thinking, believing, and living. There is one thing that all human beings have in common: we all want to be happy. The manner in which we seek happiness varies tremendously. Our Father in Heaven wants us to find the kind of happiness that is everlasting and eternal. Everything in the gospel is designed to help us towards this goal. The commandments, gospel principles and teachings, our families, priesthood ordinances, covenants, temples, leaders, and a living prophet help us to find true joy. His plan for us is called the “great plan of happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Alma 42:8</a>).</p>
<p>Many try to find happiness and fulfillment in activities and pursuits that are contrary to the Lord’s commandments. The irony is that they think they are seeking pleasure, but in reality, they are rejecting the source of real happiness. Giving in to the devil, who “seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:27</a>) may seem very enticing, but the results are usually very sad, painful, agonizing, and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I am in my 20th year of working with high school students. I have spent many years as a teacher and athletic administrator. I have observed the trends and tendencies of young people in the islands. Many of our LDS youth strive to live the principles and standards as taught in “For the Strength of Youth.” I could probably write a pamphlet for the opposition. It would be titled something like “For the Shortcomings of Youth” or “For the Deficiency of Youth.” Many make choices that are the complete opposite of what is taught in this church. Improper dress and appearance, vulgar entertainment and media, dishonesty, crude language, distasteful music and dancing, Word of Wisdom violations, and teenage pregnancy are just some of the ills of our society. These are all norms that I observe on a consistent basis. We know the truth of Alma’s warning to his son Corianton: “Wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Alma 41:10</a>).</p>
<p>The enduring joys of spiritual growth, service, and hard work are what we should be striving for. We need to remember that the only way to real happiness is to live the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. A lifetime of strengthening our faith, helping others strengthen their faith, prayer, repentance, and service to our fellow man will bring eternal happiness. I have learned some valuable lessons throughout my life as a husband and father but also by serving as a stake president and working as an athletic director that I think can help all of us understand Father Lehi’s declaration: “Men are, that they might have joy” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.15,%2025?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:15, 25</a>). I’d like to make sure we are following the formula presented by Nephi when he said, “It came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Nephi 5:27</a>). He had recently left his wicked brothers and established a society founded on gospel truths. I believe it a worthwhile pursuit to explore this topic.</p>
<p>Recently, I read an article written by a seminary teacher, Brother Hank Smith, who gave a talk during BYU Education Week on “The Science of Happiness.” He shared some interesting things. He said that it is absolutely clear in science that human beings want to be happy. They cannot get rid of that pursuit. Even evil people pursue things that will make them happy. Type in “happiness” on Amazon.com, and you’ll find 2,000 books on the topic. He explained that happiness hasn’t increased much over a 50-year time frame. Even though technology that is supposed to make a person happy has increased tremendously since 1972, life hasn’t gotten happier. He quoted President Boyd K. Packer: “It was meant to be that life would be a challenge. To suffer some anxiety, some depression, some disappointment, even some failure is normal. Teach our members that if they have a good, miserable day once in a while, or several in a row, to stand steady and face them. Things will straighten out. There is great purpose in our struggle in life” (<em>That All May Be Edified</em> (1982), 94). He shared that factors that influence happiness are 50 percent genetics, 10 percent circumstances, and 40 percent activities a person chooses to do. A comparison study was done by the National Institute of Health in 1978 between the happiness levels of lottery winners and people with paraplegia. The study showed that happiness levels were about equal between the groups. Another happiness researcher, Kate Bratskeir, took data from multiple happiness studies from the past 40 years and put together a list of what she called “The Habits of Supremely Happy People.”&nbsp;I’d like to share this list with you.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Things that Supremely Happy People Do:</strong></p>
<p>It is this last point, happy people are spiritual, that I would like to explore to a greater extent with you this morning. The common restored gospel of Jesus Christ that we all share should set us apart from the world. I’d like to suggest my own list of gospel principles that will help us to find eternal joy and happiness.</p>
<p>As an athletic director, I have worked with numerous coaches, athletes, and teams. I have come to find that sports are a great metaphor for life. In the course of athletic pursuits, many analogies can be made to what transpires in a person’s life. There are ups and downs: the endless challenges, constant adversity, and what it takes to meet them head on. As in sports, so is life. I will share seven spiritual life lessons from sports that I believe will help us to live after the manner of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>1. Learn and Master the Fundamentals</strong></p>
<p>Before you play a sport, you must learn the basics or fundamentals: how to play, how to pass, dribble, run, tackle, or shoot the ball. You have to develop the necessary technical and tactical skills to play at an acceptable level. In life, we must also focus on the basics. We must understand what Heavenly Father’s plan is for us to develop the requisite skills and strategies for attaining it.</p>
<p>It takes hard work to bring about success. You are furthering your education and preparing for your life’s work. You are developing good habits that will have great power in your life. Nephi suggested that sowing seeds, reaping in abundance, and the raising of animals of every kind brought joy into his people’s lives. Our 11-year-old son Ala is learning this lesson well. In the spring, he was contacting people via Craigslist in hopes of starting his own chicken farm. He purchased a dozen Rhode Island Red chicks, built them a home and nesting boxes, and has diligently cared for them for many months. When they started laying eggs a few weeks ago, he was overjoyed with his contributions to the breakfast table. I’m hopeful that these lessons and responsibilities early in his life are paving the way for him to develop good work habits that will bless his life. I believe that developing these kinds of characteristics help us be better disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We are taught to be industrious people. The mental, spiritual, and physical work about us is endless. Our sense of accomplishment comes when we do well in our world. Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915–85) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles commented on this vital element of a happy life: “We are here on earth to work—to work long, hard, arduous hours, to work until our backs ache and our tired muscles knot, to work all our days” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1979/04/stand-independent-above-all-other-creatures?lang=eng" target="_blank">Stand Independent above All Other Creatures</a>,” <em>Ensign, </em>May 1979, 93).</p>
<p>Another habit we should develop is to read the scriptures regularly. This will help us to develop a clear perspective of our eternal goals. The scriptures will help us to resist temptation and comfort us in times of need. They will keep us in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. I love the expression of joy that is described in Elder Parley P. Pratt’s autobiography, in which he describes his first encounter with the Book of Mormon, which he called “that book of books.”</p>
<p>“I read all day; eating was a burden, I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred reading to sleep.</p>
<p>“As I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and comprehended that the book was true, as plainly and manifestly as a man comprehends and knows that he exists. My joy was now full, as it were, and I rejoiced sufficiently to more than pay me for all the sorrows, sacrifices and toils of my life” (<em>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt</em>, ed. Parley P. Pratt Jr. [1979], 37).</p>
<p>There are many other little habits or basics that demonstrate our commitment and devotion to the Lord. These habits will help us to guard against spiritual apathy. I have witnessed many members of my stake become complacent and be influenced by the world “to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they [begin] to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and [begin] to disbelieve all which they [have] heard and seen” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.1?lang=eng#0" target="_blank">3 Nephi 2:1</a>). This complacency in the Church leads many to believe Satan’s lies, such as “You don’t need to attend church for 3 hours. You’re wasting your time saying your prayers and reading your scriptures. It’s no big deal to watch this movie or listen to that music.” “And thus [does] Satan get possession of the hearts of the people” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 2:2</a>).</p>
<p>Elder M. Russell Ballard said, “True discipleship, therefore, precludes any complacency. The Lord expects us to continue moving the Church forward and even to accelerate our pace toward the literal fulfillment of Daniel’s prophetic vision of ‘a stone … cut out without hands … that … became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/2.34-35?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">Daniel 2:34-35</a>). To do this more effectively, each one of us needs to follow Nephi’s counsel to ‘press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. [For] if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). The power of the Holy Ghost will fill our hearts and minds as we look to the Savior for answers to the many challenges of life.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us?lang=eng" target="_blank">“How Is It with Us?” </a><em>Ensign</em>, May 2000)</p>
<p><strong>2. Mental and Physical Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Elite athletes know that optimal performances and winning games only happen if you are prepared both mentally and physically. You must be in great physical shape to withstand a long, grueling, and demanding season. Equally important is the mental fitness needed that includes a positive, willing, and winning mindset. In life, being prepared both physically and mentally is also essential.</p>
<p>I believe that our best preparation comes from the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Our baptismal covenants and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost set us on a course in life and prepare us for anything that will come our way. In 2 Timothy, we read one of Paul’s stirring statements that should give us great courage. “Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.6-7?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">2 Timothy 1:6-7</a>).</p>
<p>Paul encouraged Timothy to “stir up the gift of God, which is in thee.” This is an admonition to revive the gift of the Holy Ghost and keep it strong and alive in his life. Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pointed out, “These four words—‘Receive the Holy Ghost’—are not a passive pronouncement; rather, they constitute a priesthood injunction—an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:26</a>). The Holy Ghost does not become operative in our lives merely because hands are placed upon our heads and those four important words are spoken. As we receive this ordinance, each of us accepts a sacred and ongoing responsibility to desire, to seek, to work, and to so live that we indeed ‘receive the Holy Ghost’ and its attendant spiritual gifts” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2010/11/receive-the-holy-ghost.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank">Receive the Holy Ghost</a>,”<em> Ensign</em> or <em>Liahona,</em> Nov. 2010, 95).</p>
<p>I have encouraged the members of my stake to make this goal a mathematical problem. I’ve asked them to add to their lives things that bring the Spirit to a greater measure and to subtract from their lives the things that hinder the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives and families. Truly receiving the Holy Ghost in our lives will bring eternal joy. If you are struggling in this area, you might want to apply a little CPR. Church, Pray, Read. The little fundamentals in your lives will make a big difference to bring a greater measure of the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be an Unselfish Team Player</strong></p>
<p>Sports require contributions and cooperation from every member of the team in order to play well and win. Everyone must focus, work together, and fulfill their individual roles for the common good of the team. Trusting in your teammates and understanding that personal glory will not get the job done is critical. In life, it is essential to contribute, cooperate, and share.</p>
<p>For me, there was no better place to learn this lesson than in the mission field. Missionaries join the Lord’s army, and each contribution adds up to a massive worldwide effort for good. I often think of the missionary experiences that I had as a young man in the Canada Winnipeg Mission. Besides the freezing cold, I grew from each experience and each day spent as a missionary. My mission president, Jess Christensen, and his wife continue to be an inspiration to me. They are currently serving as a senior missionary couple here on the BYU–Hawaii campus. They have served a number of missions as a couple. That dedication to the Lord and this church is impeccable. I’ll never forget the counsel he gave me as I left the mission field. He said simply to go home and serve. I have tried to do that ever since. I love missionaries and missionary work. Our missionary son has told us on more than one occasion that the greatest preparation he had for his mission was having the missionaries teach our family and friends in our home. Over the years, we have been blessed to have many of our friends, neighbors, and loved ones join the Church.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story of a great missionary in our stake. Tyler is a young man attending high school. He loves to share the gospel and is bold in sharing his faith. He started talking to one of his teachers in school about baptism, and there was some interest in learning more. Tyler made a referral to the sister missionaries in his ward, who made a referral to the elders in my ward. The missionaries quickly discovered that this teacher is a neighbor to the stake president. The elders showed up to my home, and the pressure was on. I immediately took them across the street, through the pasture, and to the home of Dave, Bidya, and their two daughters. The invitation was made to come over and continue the discussion about baptism. The missionaries taught all of the discussions, and they were baptized just a few months ago. They are doing well in their early efforts to live the gospel. It’s always a joy to see God’s children accept and embrace the restored gospel. I love the missionary scripture found in section 18 of the D&amp;C: “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance. And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth! Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10-16?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 18:10-1</a>6). If you are thinking of serving a mission, go. If you have returned from a mission, continue being a missionary and be a part of the team.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be Alert and Aware</strong></p>
<p>The best athletes know how to anticipate the play. They have extraordinary court or field vision and awareness. They know where other players are on the court or field, the other’s player’s tendencies, and the plays that work best against the opposing teams. They have the ability to anticipate and be active, rather than reactive, players in a game. This is one factor that separates great athletes from good athletes. In life, we achieve much more when we are conscious and aware of what is going on around us.</p>
<p>Satan wants us to believe that we are an exception to God’s commandments. We not only offend God by breaking His laws, we offend ourselves and those around us and are subject to suffering and misery, the opposite of happiness. The contrast between good and evil is explained so well by Alma to his son Helaman: “Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Alma 36:21</a>). Obedience is a matter of exercising our agency in a righteous way. In this world, everything has its opposite.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to witness the obedience displayed by members all over the world. Every six months, we are blessed to participate in General Conference and have the opportunity to be instructed by the servants of God. We are often encouraged to keep the commandments, to love our fellow man, to serve, and to rescue the lost or less active. The prophets of our day communicate the voice of God to all the Church and the entire world. We should pay attention and follow their instruction and suggestions. It is inspiring to witness the faithful payment of tithes and offerings and faithful members who live the law of chastity and keep the Word of Wisdom. I feel fortunate to witness the tremendous blessings that come into the lives of members who are obedient to God’s commandments and heed the counsel of his living prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>King Benjamin gave this wonderful advice: “And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:41</a>).</p>
<p><strong>5. If Things Are Not Working, Readjust the Game Plan</strong></p>
<p>If things are not working, you have to adjust and then adjust some more. The opponents’ strengths and styles require different tactics. You must be able to withstand and respond to whichever attacks an opponent uses on you. Life is also full of challenges, which require us to adjust our game plan.</p>
<p>The temples that dot the earth teach and orient God’s children to His plan of happiness. They also provide the ordinances and covenants that are essential to attain that happiness. Happy people go to the temple as often as circumstances allow. Utilizing the temples will help us to make the necessary adjustments to move onward and upward in life. The members of our stake often pay a high price to be able to attend the temple here in Laie. Travel costs make it very expensive to attend the temple. However, we have many that regularly make the sacrifices necessary to participate in temple ordinances. I regularly encourage every member of my stake to be a current temple recommend holder. I believe we are happier people when we are living the standards that the Lord has set and are worthy of a recommend. We receive a greater understanding of God’s ways and a greater commitment to living our lives His way.</p>
<p>I love Elder Boyd K. Packer’s expression of feelings about the temple: “When we say <em>temple</em> I would list what in essence are Latter-day Saint synonyms for the word: marriage, family, children, happiness, joy, eternal life, resurrection, redemption, exaltation, inspiration, revelation” (<em>The Holy Temple</em> [1980], 260). The path of coming unto Christ must include experiences in the temple. The temple is synonymous with happiness and joy. We should be able to see the reality of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in the ordinances of the temple.</p>
<p>The Savior and his teachings were the focus of Nephi’s work. “And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">2 Nephi 25:26</a>). Peace and happiness in this world come as we repent of our sins and forgive one another. It is the Atonement of our Savior and his role as the advocate with our Heavenly Father that allows us to readjust our lives.</p>
<p>We understand His love for us as we read the account of His visit to the American continent. “And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome. And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise. And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.18-20?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">3 Nephi 17:18-20</a>)</p>
<p>It is heartwarming to watch members apply the Atonement of our Savior in their lives. They exercise their faith unto repentance, must learn to repair the hurt they have caused, and master the principles of forgiveness and demonstrating godly sorrow for past transgressions. They continue to adjust and readjust their thinking, speaking, and actions. They follow the Savior.</p>
<p><strong>6. Never Give Up on the Play</strong></p>
<p>Perseverance means never giving up on a play. These athletes get after the ball; they dive for loose balls, outwit defenders, and make every last second count. You must be willing to do the small things that the statistics of the game don’t necessarily reflect. You must never give up, not on the play, not on the game, not on yourself. In life, we must persevere. Never, ever, ever give up.</p>
<p>The way that we interact with others around us will largely determine the level of satisfaction we enjoy in this life. We must persevere in the relationships that we form in life. Many of you may be preparing for marriage in the temple. I counsel you to make it an important objective to live worthy of a temple recommend that you may be ready for this important step in life. Be positive and upbeat about your future, and make sure you are acting accordingly. Once married, be fiercely loyal to one another. The need for belonging and happiness will come in our family relationships. We will experience the greatest joys of life within the family.</p>
<p>Stake presidents become familiar with a good amount of marriages and families that become subject to the enticings of the devil. Marriages relationships can grow cold when one spouse or the other pursues selfishness in one of its many forms. Guard against letting anything but your eternal companion being the top priority in your life. The decision to divorce can have consequences for generations to come. Never stop dating and courting one another. The associations you have with your children, the engagement in worthwhile recreational activities, and the love shared in the home will be among your most treasured memories and fondest remembrances. Our children have certainly provided that for us.</p>
<p>In 4 Nephi, a valuable lesson is taught that will help us build and maintain positive relationships in our families: “And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.15-16?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">4 Nephi 1:15-16</a>).</p>
<p><strong>7. Accept Both Victory and Defeat Graciously</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to win, but no matter what sport you play, you can’t win every game. It takes blood, sweat, and tears to win a championship. If you give it everything you’ve got, no matter the outcome, you can walk away with your head held high. Learn what it takes to win, and come back and try again. Accepting defeat can help you learn what it takes to win. So it is with life. Everything will not always go your way. There will be both losses and wins. Giving your best shot and learning the lessons along the way make you a winner.</p>
<p>Our goal is eternal life. We strive for that goal each day. The journey of mortality will provide the lessons that will strengthen and refine our souls. Legendary basketball coach John Wooden once said, “Success comes from knowing that you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.” I also love what Nephi taught about enduring to the end: “And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save. Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, may we live after the manner of happiness taught in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. May we apply these seven spiritual life lessons to find eternal joy. I testify that our Heavenly Father loves each one of us. Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. He is our example and our light. May your thoughts, words, and deeds lead to happiness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>November 11, 2014<br />Grant Hardy<br />Professor of History and Religious Studies, University of North Carolina at Asheville<br />Joseph Smith Lecturer<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I have here a book that was given to me by an investigator while I was serving a mission in Taiwan in the early 1980s. We had shared with her the Book of Mormon, and in return, she gave me this English translation of the <em>Buddhacarita</em>, a biography of the Buddha written by Asvaghosa around 120 AD. Inside, she had written her testimony of Buddhism. Since we were asking her to read a book that meant a great deal to us, that we held sacred, it seemed only fair to take a look in return at a book that she regarded as scripture. I didn’t spend a lot of time with the Buddha’s biography since a mission is not really the right setting to study other religions in depth, but I was touched by her gesture of faith, and after I returned home, I learned much more about Buddhism as well as Daoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Islam.</p>
<p>Growing up Mormon, I had naturally encountered other forms of Christianity, and I knew the story of the Apostasy and the Restoration, but it wasn’t until my mission that I realized how much of the world is left out of that narrative. Many of you come from places where you have much more exposure to non-Christian religions, perhaps even among your own friends and family, and you already know what I only discovered at nineteen—there are devout, good people around the world who are not of our faith, and much of what they believe is inspiring and even admirable. (Of course, this is true of other Christians as well.) As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">D&amp;C 1:30</a>), how should we respond to other religions? Particularly when it is obvious that many of their teachings are “virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank"><em>Articles of Faith </em>1:13</a>).</p>
<p>It can’t simply be a matter of “we’re right and you’re wrong” or “our beliefs are true and yours are false.” Such polarized, even close-minded thinking hardly seems worthy of disciples of Christ, let alone Latter-day Saints. Joseph Smith once taught that “we should cultivate a meek, quiet and peaceable spirit,” and he extended that to interfaith dialogue: “Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc. any truth? Yes. ... We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true ‘Mormons.’”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Nearly eighty years later, in 1921, George Albert Smith acknowledged the good in other religions, telling a nonmember friend: “We have come not to take away from you the truth and virtue you possess. We have come not to find fault with you nor to criticize you. ... Keep all the good that you have, and let us bring to you more good, in order that you may be happier and in order that you may be prepared to enter into the presence of our Heavenly Father.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;And some eighty years after that, in 2004, the <em>Preach My Gospel</em> manual noted that “just as the Christian world was blessed by the courage and vision of the reformers, many other nations and cultures have been blessed by those who were given that portion ‘that [God] seeth fit that they should have.’ Teachings of other religious leaders [including Buddha, Confucius, and Mohammad] have helped many people become more civil and ethical.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I will be speaking this morning about three scriptures that can guide our interactions with those of other faiths.</p>
<p>The first of these is <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/6.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">Luke 6:31</a>, the Golden Rule, which is probably good advice in any situation: “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” Just as we would like others to be respectful of our beliefs, and to be generous and fair-minded in representing the tenets of our faith, so we in turn should treat the religious commitments and understandings of others in a similar fashion. I know how frustrating it can be when people get the basic principles of Mormonism wrong or dismiss them lightly, and I try hard not to be guilty of the same mistake when I teach world religions.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of a time when I was the beneficiary of the Golden Rule. Several years ago, our family hosted an LDS high school exchange student from Japan, Takeshi Ikeda. (Some of you may know him; he’s a BYU–Hawaii student right now.) And last January, we had an opportunity to travel to Japan and spend a day with his family. His mother was excited to take us around Tokyo and asked what we would most like to see.</p>
<p>High on my list was the Meiji Shrine—a key site in Shinto, the native Japanese religion. It was a last minute suggestion on my part, and she called the shrine the day before to try to arrange for someone to show us around only to be told that it was too short notice, and they only did that for educational groups. But when she mentioned that we were Mormon and that I once taught at BYU, they said, “Wait a minute. We’ve got someone here who might be willing to help you.” One of the Shinto priests, Moriyasu Ito, was delighted to serve as our guide since he had visited Utah a few years ago on a religious outreach trip and had studied for a semester at BYU, staying with an LDS family in Provo. He had had a wonderful experience and wanted to repay the kindness he had been shown.</p>
<p>So our tour of the beautiful Meiji Shrine included not only information about Shinto beliefs and practices but also conversations about family home evenings, questions about where our son wanted to serve a mission, and a story about the time the priest met President Hinckley.</p>
<p>It was a most unusual, marvelous tour that only happened because some Latter-day Saints treated this man and his religion with the dignity and respect that they themselves would have liked.</p>
<p>My second scripture comes from <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/29?lang=eng" target="_blank">Alma 29</a>. One of the things I love about the restored gospel is its expanded view of revelation. God cares for all His children, and His interactions with humanity were not limited to a few nations on the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times. One of the most significant messages of the Book of Mormon is that the Lord has spoken to men and women around the world, throughout history, and even in the modern era. That particular book of scripture is a record of Israelite prophets in the Americas, but it contains promises of still more records yet to come forth from elsewhere on the globe (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.10-14?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">2 Nephi 29:10-14</a>). In addition, Moroni testifies that everyone has received the spirit of Christ, or a conscience, to guide their actions (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.15-19?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">Moroni 7:15-19</a>), and there are oblique references to more specific instances of revelation.</p>
<p>For example, when Alma, in a fit of missionary exuberance, wishes that he could speak as loudly and forcefully as an angel, to “cry repentance unto every people!” (it makes you wonder what he would have done with a Facebook or Twitter account), the Spirit urges patience and contentment.</p>
<p>Alma says, “I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Alma 29:1</a>) I love that last line. But then he realizes that our Heavenly Father has things well in hand, that his plan of salvation is unfolding on schedule, and that the work of redemption is already underway. Even in Alma’s day, in the first century BC, people all over the world were choosing good or evil, life or death, according to their desires and the light and knowledge they had so far received.</p>
<p>Alma continues, “For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that the seeth fit that they should have” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Alma 29:8</a>).</p>
<p>“Of their own nation and tongue” means that the Chinese had been hearing some portion of God’s word from inspired Chinese sages, Indians from Indian gurus, Africans from African elders, and South Sea Islanders from island teachers, or as a First Presidency Statement dated February 15th, 1978 put it, “The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a familiar concept to many of you, and we might nod in agreement with the general sentiment, but let me give you some specific examples from my own studies of world religions. For this talk, in the interest of time, I’ll stick to a single faith tradition—Buddhism. How do we know which of the Buddha’s teachings convey a portion of God’s word? It might be easy to respond, “Well, the ones in which he agrees with us,” but I think there’s more to it than that. Reading the sutras or talking to Buddhists just to find parallels with what we already know isn’t that satisfying or helpful. It also fails to take their beliefs seriously, on their own terms. We should be alert to both similarities and differences and even to places where we can learn from other religions. I believe that Buddhism contains spiritual insights that can enlarge and enrich our understanding of God, humanity, and nature. We may have the truth, but we certainly don’t have all truths.</p>
<p>For instance, the Buddha taught his followers to live by the Five Precepts, the first four of which are no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, and no false speech. This sounds like inspired counsel to me, and I’m sure that you recognize the parallels with the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>The fifth precept, however, may be somewhat unexpected: no intoxicants. Latter-day Saints, of course, will say, “That’s good advice; it’s just like the Word of Wisdom.” And indeed, it is easy for me to view the Buddha’s Five Precepts as an example of the Lord “grant[ing] unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word.” And yet in digging a little deeper, there are things we can learn from Buddhists about our shared values. For instance, many Buddhists have taken the prohibition against killing as not only forbidding murder but as not causing harm to any living beings—human or animal. There is a keen sense that all life is sacred and valuable and much discussion of the numerous ways in which we might harm others. And that has made me think harder about my treatment of all of God’s creations.</p>
<p>According to the scholar Peter Harvey, “The second precept is seen as ruling out any act of theft, but also fraud, cheating, borrowing without the intention to return, and taking more than is one’s due.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;The fourth precept, against false speech, has been defined not only as not lying but also not deceiving others, manipulating others, engaging in idle chatter, or using hurtful words. And that reminds me that it is possible to lie without saying a word—sometimes being silent and allowing a false impression to remain can be a form of deception. The prohibition of intoxicants is familiar to Latter-day Saints, but the reasons given by the Buddha are a little different. When we explain the Word of Wisdom to our friends or to each other, we often talk of health, our bodies being temples, and the blessings that come from obedience. Those are valuable concepts, but Buddhists tend to speak of the importance of always being in a state of mental clarity and mindfulness. Intoxication makes a person more likely to break the other precepts and less likely to keep his or her attention focused on what is truly important in life. In addition, some may turn to alcohol or drugs to escape their troubles rather than looking toward the true source of liberation from suffering—the Four Noble Truths in the case of Buddhism but Jesus Christ in our own tradition. The word “mindfulness” never appears in our LDS standard works, but I have found it both useful and inspiring in my own spiritual discipleship. Can studying Buddhism make me a better Latter-day Saint? I think so.</p>
<p>There are certainly great differences between Buddhism and Mormonism. For example, the Buddhist doctrine that nothing has a permanent self, or soul, stands in stark contrast to our understanding of being spirit children of heavenly parents with an eternal destiny ahead of us, and yet in the New Testament, Jesus says, “He that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Matthew 10:39</a>). Jesus may have been talking about actual martyrdom, but we often read this in terms of “selfless action,” and Buddhists have a great deal to say about that. How much of what we do is colored by selfish considerations? Even when we offer service, aren’t we often motivated by concerns for rewards—spiritual or otherwise—or a desire for others to think well of us? Or perhaps we just enjoy the feeling of saying, “I’m a good person.” Is it ever really possible to help others with no thought of self?</p>
<p>Buddhists spend a lot of time thinking about these issues, and they teach that truly selfless actions are not only possible but are characterized by the “Four Immeasurables”: loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. These have been explained as follows: “Loving kindness is an attitude of pure goodwill toward self and others that always seeks the welfare and happiness of all beings. ... Compassion, an attitude of pity or empathy for oneself and others who are suffering, contains the desire to free all beings from pain.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;So far, it sounds a lot like Alma’s exclamation “O that I were an angel,” which, as you will remember, culminates in the hope that “there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth” (Alma 29:2). To continue: “Sympathetic joy is joy at the joy of others, and is the antidote to jealousy and discontent. Equanimity is an even-minded serenity towards beings, which balances concern for others with a realization that suffering is an inevitable part of being alive.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;This reminds me of Lehi’s teaching about the necessity for “opposition in all things”. Brigham Young once taught the Saints that “’Mormonism,’ so-called, embraces every principle pertaining to life and salvation, for time and eternity. No matter who has it. If the infidel has got truth it belongs to ‘Mormonism.’ The truth and sound doctrine possessed by the sectarian world, and they have a great deal, all belong to this Church. ... All that is good, lovely, and praiseworthy belongs to this Church and Kingdom. ‘Mormonism’ includes all truth.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;I like to think that Mormonism, in President Young’s expansive definition, encompasses such principles as loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.</p>
<p>In that same passage, Brigham Young also pointed out, again speaking of non-Mormons, “As for their morality, many of them are, morally, just as good as we are.” I saw a Buddhist example of this a few months ago in a visit to Myanmar or Burma. Burma is a very religious country with about 500,000 monks and 75,000 nuns out of a population of 60 million, 90% of whom are Buddhist.</p>
<p>We were invited at attend a novitiation ceremony where five boys, about 8-10 years old, were being ordained monks. Nearly all males in Burma are ordained when they are boys, and they spend at least a week living in a monastery learning about Buddhism, wearing maroon robes, getting up at 4:30 am, and eating their last meal of the day before noon. It’s a little like a vacation Bible boarding school, and it gives everyone a good idea of the lives of monks. Those who choose to make their stay in a monastery permanent (usually when they return as young men) are given a great deal of respect, and one of the precipitating events that led to the recent, welcome political reforms was the so-called “Saffron Revolution” when tens of thousands of monks joined in the demonstrations.</p>
<p>The ceremony we saw was a joyous occasion, complete with a procession, music, and feasting.</p>
<p>Imagine what this means, not only to the boys but also to the adults in their lives. Wilfred Cantwell Smith, writing about the Burmese novitiation ceremony, observed, “Here the parents are participating in that profoundly moving experience of dramatically expressing their handing over of their son from their own personal charge to that of the society, and in a sense handing him over to his own charge, to be responsible now for himself. ... It is a thrilling and solemn moment to see a son cut the ties that relate him directly to his parents and at the same time turn his face in the direction that those parents have found to be supremely good.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>In Mormonism, baptism occurs at about this age, but the real parallel comes later. As the boys had their heads shaved and donned new robes, with parents and grandparents anxiously and proudly looking on, we were reminded of what Latter-day Saints feel when they send their children off to the MTC. There’s a sadness at parting, of course, but also joy at the realization that those young elders and sisters are choosing to follow the path that their parents themselves have trod and found supremely good.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of our visit, we were able to participate in feeding the 1400 monks and nuns in residence. As they passed by giant vats of food in double file, we put scoopfuls into their begging bowls, and I found it quite moving. There is a close, mutually-supporting relationship between the monks and the laity that acknowledges self-sacrifice, devotion, generosity, and faith. It is perhaps a model for how Mormon missionaries might connect to a strong ward, especially one with a number of returned missionaries, parents of missionaries, and members who were themselves converts.</p>
<p>It is a blessing to be a missionary and a blessing to able to feed the missionaries and support them in all sorts of way (including introducing them to your friends).</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the Burmese ritual recreates a moment in the life of the Buddha who was raised as a prince in luxurious circumstances and then chose to give that up in order to pursue spiritual enlightenment and to benefit all sentient beings. And it made me consider the role of religious sacrifice within our own tradition. What am I, or you, willing to give up in order to follow God’s will? When I taught at BYU–Hawaii several years ago, I was impressed by the faithfulness of many of the students here who are sometimes asked to do harder things than their peers in Provo or in Idaho. When I graduated from BYU–Provo, it was understood that I could serve the kingdom by being as successful in my profession as I cared to be. By contrast, BYU–Hawaii students are often urged to return to their home countries after graduation, which means forgoing professionally and financially satisfying opportunities in the United States in order build up the Church in your native lands. It is a sacrifice that I was never asked to make, or even consider, but it will allow you to join the ranks of those messengers praised by Alma, who teach the word of God in “all nations, of their own nation and tongue.”</p>
<p>Another thing that I love about the restored gospel is its expansive vision of the plan of salvation. If baptism is required of everyone who enters the kingdom of God, what about those who lived before Christ or in regions never visited by Christian missionaries or even those who might have accepted the gospel had they just lived a few years longer? This is a serious theological conundrum for most Christians, since unlike Buddhists or Hindus, they believe that this life is our one chance to find and embrace the truth. But Mormonism provides an answer. Not only has God been inspiring religious figures throughout the world with a portion of his word, He also allows the opportunities of mortality to be extended into the spirit world so that missionary work will continue on the other side of the veil, assisted by vicarious ordinances for the dead performed in holy temples. Before the final judgment, every soul who has ever lived will have a chance to hear the fullness of the gospel taught in plainness by missionaries whom they love and trust. It is a doctrine of exquisite fairness and compassion.</p>
<p>Yet there may seem to be something of a contradiction here. If other religions enjoy some portion of the truth and all individuals will someday have the opportunity to hear the gospel message and make an informed decision, whether in this life or the next, why are Latter-day Saints so anxious to convert the world? Why worry about hastening the work?</p>
<p>And here I would like to share another scripture with you—the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, from Matthew 20. Early in the morning the master of the vineyard hires some workers and offers them the usual daily wage. About nine o’clock, he sees others standing around in the marketplace and he hires them as well, promising that he will pay them what is right. He goes out at noon and does the same and then again at three o’clock. And finally, at five o’clock, he finds still others who have been waiting all day, and he hires them. An hour later, as the sun is going down, he pays all his workers, and he gives each of them the same wage, regardless of how long they had labored, which causes some grumbling among those who had been working all day out in the hot sun. The master reminds them that he gave them exactly what they had agreed upon, and he gently criticizes them for being envious at his generosity to their fellows.</p>
<p>I’m never quite sure if Latter-day Saints are the ones who have been working hard all day, while others can accept the gospel later in life or even posthumously, or if Mormons are the well-paid latecomers, as we certainly are in terms of the history of world religions. In any case, there is a lesson here that God can do as He will with His gifts, and we should not worry too much about whether others have more or less than we do—in the end, our Heavenly Father loves all His children, and those who come to Him, whether early or late, will enjoy the same reward of eternal life. (Remember Buddhism’s “sympathetic joy,” that is, joy at the joy of others.)</p>
<p>Nephi spoke along these lines when he reproved modern Christians for believing that God had only spoken through their own scripture: “Thou fool, that shall say, ‘A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible.’ Know ye not that there are more nations than one? ... Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written. For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them, for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.6,%2010-11?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">2 Nephi 29:6, 10-11</a>). It may be that God will judge Buddhists in the light of Buddhism, Hindus in the light of Hinduism, and Muslims in the light of Islam. We know a great deal about the covenants that the Lord made with the house of Israel, yet He may have made different covenants with other peoples around the globe (as, for example, with the Jaredites, who left Mesopotamia long before Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and thus were definitely not Israelites). Yet at some point, every person who has ever lived will have an opportunity to accept the gospel of Jesus Christ and be numbered among those who have entered into the covenants that will lead to exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom.</p>
<p>That, indeed, is the covenant we entered into at baptism, and our particular agreement for laboring in God’s vineyard comes with the responsibility to share the gospel with others. Doctrine and Covenants 81 includes an injunction to seek out learning of all kinds: “things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad ... and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.” Does that include knowing about other religions? Of course it does. And why is this knowledge necessary? To help us become better Latter-day Saints and better missionaries. The passage continues, “Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.79-81?lang=eng#78" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:79-81</a>). But it is impossible to be a good teacher without being a good listener and a good learner as well.</p>
<p>How many of our brother and sisters around the globe have enjoyed a portion of God’s word but have felt some uneasiness as well, some uncertainty, or the feeling that something was missing? What a joy it is to know what we believe—to be able to proclaim the fullness of the gospel boldly and confidently to our friends, our neighbors, and our families</p>
<p>We can seek out truth and goodness throughout the world, among all cultures and religions, and we can do so humbly and sincerely. We have so much to learn. But at the same time, we should not hesitate to share what we know. There are marvelous blessings that come from keeping the commandments and living the principles of the Gospel, in this life, right now. God’s plan of happiness, through Jesus Christ, is open to everyone, and we are his messengers, inviting all who hunger and thirst to come to the feast and be filled (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.42?lang=eng#41" target="_blank">Alma 32:42</a>). Of this I bear witness, in Jesus’ holy name. Amen.</p>

<p>In my short life, I have never had the necessary standing to actually say this with authority, so may I, here today? My brothers and sisters, Aloha.</p>
<p>I always enjoy speaking after my wife has spoken because it answers so many questions people have. Now you know how a guy like me ends up in places like this.</p>
<p>I grew up in Northern California with a brother who is just a year older than me. We got along the way brothers do except for one major disturbing difference between us: he is a genius. He really is. He grew up to become a Ph.D. physicist. He has helped build scientific devices that are today doing experiments on the planet Mars, but even as a child, he was brilliant and curious.</p>
<p>One day, when we were about 12 and 13, he came home from a used bookstore very excited about a dusty old book he had found. I wasn’t all that excited about dusty old books until he explained, “This is a ‘Formulary.”</p>
<p>I had no reaction.</p>
<p>“I was flipping through the index, and there is a formula in here for rocket fuel.”</p>
<p>“Ok?”</p>
<p>“Steve, I’ve got all this stuff. We can make a rocket.”</p>
<p>So, he had me. We went off and measured and stirred the ingredients together, but the final step was to use a mortar and pestle to grind the chemicals into a perfectly fine powder so the blended chemicals would react with each other when we lit it on fire. We didn’t have a mortar or a pestle. We were 12, and it’s not like we were going to ask our parents for help—building explosives.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there were warnings in the book about how volatile, and how toxic, and how these combinations of chemicals needed ventilation… all written for lesser mortals. We had this.</p>
<p>So, he took the powder to the back porch and pounded it with a brick and with a hammer but could never get the right consistency for it to actually burn. We would try to light some of it, and it would just smolder and sputter, so I gave up and walked away.</p>
<p>But Mark was a genius. It occurred to him that all of those ingredients were water-soluble. If he dissolved them together, the chemical molecules would become perfectly inter-mixed. He got a glass mason jar and filled it halfway full with water, stirred in the powder, and put it on a shelf in our room, reasoning that in a few days the water would evaporate away, and he would be left with a perfectly blended pellet of rocket fuel.</p>
<p>A few nights later, I was slumped on a couch in our family room watching Star Trek on television. My parents were not home. I was pretty absorbed in the program. The lights were off. The Klingons were threatening somehow, and Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock were engaging the dilithium crystals or whatever. I was vaguely aware that Mark had stepped into the room and fallen into a chair near the door and was watching, too. &nbsp;The Enterprise was taking enemy fire, losing its shields. I was concerned.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a tremendous sound erupted from the kitchen for which I could find no explanation in the natural world. It was a deep menacing, rumble. My muddled teenage mind wondered for a moment, “Really? Klingons?—but in our kitchen?” I jumped up and ran toward the noise, crashing into Mark as we tried to squeeze through the doorway together. As I rushed into the kitchen, I was astonished at what was going on.</p>
<p>The sound was deafening. I could see nothing but dense smoke. I followed the sound, and there was a brilliant red column of flame over the stove, blasting upward out of a steel soup can. It was like a welding torch that had already burned a hole through the stove’s steel cooking-exhaust hood and was working on the ceiling.</p>
<p>I gasped, “What is that?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark knocked me out of the way, grabbing the edge of the glowing can with a pair of pliers, and then he ran and flung it through the front door onto the lawn where it blasted and smoked and spun and sputtered like Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>I was slack jawed. “What was that?” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“That,” he said, “was… rocket fuel.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Rocket fuel?!!! Are you nuts? You put rocket fuel on a hot stove?”</p>
<p>Now, remember, my brother’s a genius, right?&nbsp; In the most condescending way, he said, “Don’t be ridiculous. It was perfectly safe. The water in the jar wasn’t evaporating, so, I decided to boil some of it off.”</p>
<p>“On a stove?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes. It should have been safe. The boiling of the water won’t let it get hotter than 212 degrees–you should know this. Everything was under control, but it boiled dry… and got too hot. Now, dad’s going to kill us.”</p>
<p>He was a genius.</p>
<p>Stuff like rocket fuel is pretty exciting. It is powerful—it can push us into space—but it requires judgment because it also has the power to destroy our homes, our lives, and everything that matters to us.</p>
<p>Perhaps a child can be forgiven for thinking for a moment that he can control the powers of chemistry, but I don’t have my brother to blame when I have been tempted to think I am such a genius that I might substitute my judgment for that of Heavenly Father or of his prophets—which, incidentally, I think my brother has seldom or never done.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the secret to happy lives. He’s given us the scriptures, which are a formulary of best-practices for safe, happy lives.</p>
<p>Then He has warned us that “Wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Alma 41:10</a>).</p>
<p>As simple as He has made it, we sometimes lose faith in Him and instead trust our own inner-genius that a little sin will bring us more happiness than will His plan.</p>
<p>We sometimes believe that we can release our grip on the iron rod just for a few miles, perhaps walking a few forbidden but enticing paths and then return with nothing more than a few stickers in our socks. We say to ourselves things like, “I know that unclean pictures on the internet may be a problem to some people, but not to me. I am strong enough to enjoy a little bit of the dark side without blowing out the light. Drugs, alcohol, gambling, or immorality in any of its varieties in small doses may be a problem to lesser creatures, but I am stronger than that. I’ll be fine. I can safely place on the flames this explosive rocket fuel that has burned to the ground untold millions of people, but I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Well, my brothers and sisters, I have stood with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">many</span> geniuses in the smoke and horror rising from such decisions.</p>
<p>When I was your age, I spent three years in the active military, and in all that time, I never lost a single friend or comrade to battle, but I lost several who either lost–or ruined–their lives doing things they knew better than to do</p>
<p>Maybe the problem of pride is the reason the scriptures warn that even the very elect would be deceived. “For in those days there shall also arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch, that, if possible, they shall deceive the very elect” (JST Matthew 1:22).</p>
<p>So, let me be plain. Explosives have a place in this world, but they have no place in the kitchen, and likewise, we, here, are men and women of God. Given who we are and given what we know and what we are called upon to do, there are places in this world <em>we</em> simply cannot go and things <em>we</em> simply cannot do.</p>
<p>So, what then is it that we <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span></em> we called upon to do?</p>
<p>A little over 2000 years ago, one of Heavenly Father’s prophets named Alma was writing in what would become the Book of Mormon about the difficult world he lived in. After describing the horrors of 15 years of continual soul-scarring conflict and warfare, he steps back and draws this conclusion about wars and about you and me. He said:</p>
<p>“And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin and transgression. … And thus we see the great call of diligen[t] men [and women] to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; … we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing—sorrow because of death and destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ unto life.” (Alma 28:13-14).</p>
<p>It’s pretty straightforward. With the clarity of a seer, Alma exposes the timeless narrative underlying the great struggle between good and evil as finally coming down to this: the powers of evil and sin ultimately being overwhelmed by diligent men and women animated by the light of Christ.</p>
<p>The scriptures explain how this miracle of light over darkness is accomplished, how “good” will come to prevail, and how “evil” will be vanquished. How do “diligent men and women” vanquish evil?</p>
<p>They stand. They stand in Holy Places—and by standing, they make those places they stand Holy, too. They stand, and having endured all, stand (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:13</a>). If they are men, they magnify their Priesthood. If they are women, they stand faithful to the priesthood covenants and blessings they have received. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the trials of living in this fallen world came to our family when our nine-year old son Tanner came home sick one day with what turned out to be a very difficult childhood cancer, which he fought for three long years.</p>
<p>Tanner was a great kid. He was full of life, like he had always known his would be short, so he had to squeeze everything into it. But we didn’t know that. All we saw was him, always full speed ahead, impatient, fun, funny—1000 miles per hour. We used to say of him that he would probably grow up to either become the prophet or a bank robber. We didn’t know which.</p>
<p>One of the Sunday mornings right before he passed away,&nbsp;he was experiencing a lot of pain. He had tumors in his bones and in his head, and he was taking a lot of pain medicine and still hurt. That morning, his mom came into his room to see if he had been able to sleep. She was amazed to find him fumbling to get his Sunday clothes on. “Tanner, I don’t think you should you be going to church. Why don’t you stay home and rest today?”</p>
<p>He hung his head for a moment, thinking about it. “I think I should go.”</p>
<p>His mom answered, “Nobody is going to expect you to come to church when you need pain medicine just to sit up in bed… when you feel this bad.“</p>
<p>“Yes, but I think it matters when I go. I see how people look at me when I pass the sacrament. I think it helps them.”</p>
<p>So, he dressed, went to church, and for the last time of his earthly life, he passed the sacrament. I saw he was right: people were looking at him. Everyone seemed to be looking at him. I saw that it mattered to them. They saw a little boy in a body, spent of all energy, making heroic exertions to present them with those symbols of the Atonement, carrying the tray from the priest’s table, then steadying himself with one hand on the end of the pew, his little bald head glistening with perspiration at the effort and his sacrifice quietly pointing to the Atonement, to Gethsemene, to Galgotha, places where exhaustion and pain and love and commitment had also inspired sacrifice. And, I noticed he had been right: it helped people. It helped me. It helps us still. Members of our ward still sometimes refer to the time Tanner passed the sacrament.</p>
<p>A few years later, I found myself in the Holy Land with my son Ryan and my son-in-law Jeremy and his father John. There was a war on at the time, so there were very few people out and about, but this was our only chance, so there we were.</p>
<p>On the Sabbath, we went to church at the BYU Jerusalem Center. Then we called a taxi and started back into the city when the Palestinian driver asked us if we had been able to visit Lazarus’ tomb. I told him we dared not go there because it was located in a Palestinian neighborhood where we might not be safe as Westerners.</p>
<p>He said, “You would be safe there with me. Let me take you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “I promised these boys’ mothers I would not take them anywhere that might be unsafe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I live in that neighborhood. I drive this car in and out many times each day. You would be among my people. You would be safe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said, “but you don’t know these boys’ mothers. We better not.”</p>
<p>We drove in silence for a minute.</p>
<p>“You really should let me take you. That is the place where our Lord raised St. Lazarus from the dead.”</p>
<p>I glanced over at this Palestinian in his Palestinian clothes with his Palestinian accent. “<em>Our</em> Lord?” I said. “Do you believe in Christ?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>I was fascinated. “How did you become a Christian?”</p>
<p>“My family is Christian.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Really. How long have they been Christian, and where did they learn of Christ?”</p>
<p>“How long? Always. We began to follow Him when He was here. We saw what He did and heard what He taught. We have always lived in Bethany. We have always followed Him.”</p>
<p>Well, we had him turn the car around. We wound through back neighborhoods, eventually arriving in little village of Bethany. The driver waited by his car.</p>
<p>There was no one but the caretaker there at the tomb who told us to just leave the key to the gate on a nail when we left. Then we found ourselves standing in a cave carved deep into a stone wall thought to be the very place Lazarus had been buried. We went down about a dozen spiraling steps to a landing from where we could see light filtering down to us from the street-level three or four meters above, and below, we could see a stone ledge where a body would have been laid.</p>
<p>I realized I was still carrying my Bible that I had taken to church, so I began to read the account from John 11.</p>
<p>Jesus had learned that his friend Lazarus had died, and then He deliberately waited three days before returning to Bethany, so there could be no doubt he was really dead.</p>
<p>Lazarus’ family, Mary and Martha, met him on the road above us. They were devastated that their brother had died.</p>
<p>“Jesus … cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">John 11:38</a>)</p>
<p>From inside the cave, we looked up and imagined how dark this place would be with a stone covering the opening, and we imagined hearing the Lord’s muffled voice from the street above.</p>
<p>“Jesus said, Take away the stone.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">John 11:39</a>)</p>
<p>We imagined the sounds we would have heard as shoulders slid stone against stone and over crunching gravel.</p>
<p>“And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. … And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.41,%2043?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">John 11:41, 43</a>)</p>
<p>We imagined being there as that command echoed down the stone passageway to him. I supposed that we would have detected an immediate movement as Lazarus came to himself, tried to move, and found himself confined by the cloth funerary wrappings and then throwing his feet over the edge of the stone bed and maybe gathering himself for a moment before standing and making his way upward step by step. He would have had to brush by us as he ascended those stairs, going up into the light.</p>
<p>I softly read on.</p>
<p>“And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: … Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.44-45?lang=eng#43" target="_blank">John 11:44-45</a>)</p>
<p>We thought about our taxi driver who was waiting in the small square above us perhaps about where his family may have stood 2000 years ago, and we wondered at their faces as they watched Lazarus walk away.</p>
<p>I closed the scriptures, and our spirits were full because of the influence of the Spirit we were feeling.</p>
<p>We began to move back toward the stairs. I lingered behind for a moment because my mind was on another boy, our 12-year old Tanner, who, like Lazarus, had died. Like Mary and Martha, I suppose, we were devastated. But in that place, made Holy to me by the Spirit that I was feeling there, I thought of the anguish of Martha and Mary a few minutes before and then of the unimaginable joy they felt when they saw their brother “come forth.”</p>
<p>In that silent place that represented restored-life, I almost involuntarily felt to speak aloud our son’s name.</p>
<p>“ Tanner.”</p>
<p>I did not have to travel to Israel to gain a testimony of the resurrection any more than I had to travel to the Sacred Grove in New York to come to know the Restoration. The feelings I felt there are the same feelings you have felt from time to time listening to people speaking in church and reading scriptures. These are feelings that inspire us to live better lives, and they are feelings that deserve our respect. The Holy Ghost inspiring our souls is as great a miracle as the parting of the Red Sea or the raising of the dead. These are instances of the veil parting for a moment as Heavenly Father tells us He loves us and cares about how we live our lives.</p>
<p>I expect my experience in that ancient tomb was nothing less than a tender mercy to one about to be called to be an “especial witness” of the Savior. My testimony was renewed that the Savior loves us—loves me—loves my wife, Kalleen — loves my children Christine and Ryan and Kelsey… and Tanner. I love Him too and testify of His goodness.</p>
<p>I am not a genius, but I have come to a knowledge that I can trust the Savior to save my family. Because I trust Him with that, I am striving with all my might to trust in His commandments. His commandments present the safest, smoothest, most joyful path through this fallen world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;leave you with my particular especial witness that Jesus is the Christ, that because of Him, our mistakes need not define or limit us.</p>
<p>I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>October 28, 2014<br />Samuel A. Erbe<br />President, Hilo Hawaii Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, family, friends, students, and faculty, Aloha! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am humbled and honored to be here today. I remember sitting in this Center not too long ago, being inspired and edified as a student of BYU–Hawaii at Devotionals such as these. I never dreamed that one day I would speak at such a Devotional. I am grateful to my eternal companion, Sister Erbe, for being brave and participating with me here today and for her fabulous introduction.</p>
<p>On January 5, 2012, in the middle of a birthday party for my daughter, I was called to serve as the Stake President of the Hilo Hawaii Stake. Hilo is about as close in environment to our native Kaneohe as we could find in the islands. We moved there by inspiration a little over five years ago. Hilo Stake consists of eight wards and two branches, including a young single adult branch. Our stake stretches from Oceanview, at the southernmost tip of the United States, to Honomu on the north coast of the Big Island.</p>
<p>This morning, I would like to share several important lessons I learned from many experiences while working on a fishing boat here in the Hawaiian Islands to earn money to go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was about the age of eleven when I realized that I had a firm testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and I knew that everything I had been taught as a child was true. I knew from very young that I was going to be a missionary someday, and every experience in my life thereafter, in one way or another, prepared me for my mission. It wasn’t until after I graduated from high school and took a year of college here at BYU–Hawaii that I was able to seriously save money for my mission.</p>
<p>In April of 2000, I was hired to work on a fishing boat called the Libra at the Honolulu Harbor. I was part of a five-man crew, and we traveled throughout the Hawaiian Islands catching schools of akule fishes. Having lived at the feet of the Koolau Mountains in Kaneohe on a banana farm all my life, this farmer boy had no idea what I was getting into, except for the promise that the pay was excellent! Little did I know that the next several months would teach me lessons that I would value for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>The life of a fisherman is not an easy one. We worked long hours from early in the morning to late at night. There is a lot of preparation involved in having a successful fishing trip. We normally traveled all night to get to our fishing spot on another island in order to arrive there first thing in the morning. One of the rules of the boat when crossing the channel from one island to another at night is that you have to tie yourself down when leaving the cabin and going outside. This was a nonnegotiable rule. There are no lights in the middle of the ocean channel between islands, and if a crew member were to fall off the boat, the cold reality is that we probably wouldn't find him alive again. The wind howls in the channel, and the waves can often reach up to 20 feet high. The scriptures also teach us that we are to tie ourselves down to the firm foundations of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;In Lehi's vision, we learn about a terrible darkness that hid the path ahead. There was an iron rod that you could hold onto that would lead you to eternal life. Those that held on found their way. Those that let go were lost in the darkness. The iron rod is the word of God and will safely guide us through. In Helaman 5:12<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, Nephi and Lehi recalled the counsel of their father Helaman and devoted themselves to preaching to the wicked Nephites. “And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.” This scripture teaches us that only by basing our lives on Jesus Christ can we withstand Satan’s temptations. We are to build our foundations upon this rock. The promise is that if we do so, men cannot fall. This promise has impacted every decision in my life.</p>
<p>Another lesson learned is that after every fishing trip, whether big or small, whether we caught a lot of fish or a little bit, we always cleaned and mended our nets. This was an arduous process. Nets are very heavy, especially when they are wet. Nets are also very smelly after a successful fishing trip. It is a stinky and messy job. We would go over every inch of our nets to ensure that there were no holes. It took practice to mend the nets. Many times, fish will entwine and tangle themselves in the net. Overnight, sharks will come and bite the fish that are stuck. Often times, we'd come across holes that were big enough for me to easily swim through. I could only imagine the size of the shark that made that hole. I was glad that I didn't run into that one in the water. Life is similar to our fishing nets. From this experience, I learned that I need to mend the nets of my life all the time. There are daily mending routines and weekly mending routines. Prophets and apostles have taught us to have daily personal and family scripture study as well as daily personal and family prayers. Family Home Evening is a spiritual protection that we do every week. Each week, we have the opportunity to mend our personal nets by renewing our covenants by partaking of the sacrament. The acts of daily and weekly mending of our spiritual nets builds spiritual power in our lives and leads to true conversion. Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has linked this to true conversion to when “you make the gospel of Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and, indeed, the very core of what you are.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has taught, “Your happiness now and forever is conditioned on your degree of conversion and the transformation that it brings to your life.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;As I ponder and consider my discipleship and true conversion, I try to focus on the following questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Where am I today?</p>
<p>2. Where do I want to be tomorrow?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Are my actions today consistently helping me to reach my spiritual goals?</p>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has explained, “Our spiritual journey is the process of a lifetime. We do not know everything in the beginning or even along the way. Our conversion comes step-by-step, line upon line. … But we are not alone.”<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;This statement reminds me of a seemingly small experience on the boat that has impacted my life. One day, our engine broke down, and we were left unable to steer as we left the island of Oahu and made our way towards the island of Kauai. We were about an hour into the ocean channel between the two islands, and the waves were rough. Let me tell you something about traveling through the island channels. It is very scary when the weather is bad. The majority of my experiences traveling through the channels were relatively okay. I learned that you can travel through the rough waters of the channel without really getting shaken up as long the boat is moving forward. However, when our engines failed, we were temporarily unable to move forward. We were at the mercy of the waves. One moment, I was lying on my bunk. The next moment, I found myself lying on the floor. It was as James states in chapter 1:6, "For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.” In my life and throughout the Hilo Hawaii Stake, I see that same lesson being taught in many different ways. &nbsp;In <em>2 </em>Nephi 26:8,<em>&nbsp;</em>Nephi explains,<em> </em>“But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution—behold, they are they which shall not perish.” No matter what hardship comes our way, we should courageously move forward.</p>
<p>On August 7, 2014, Hurricane Iselle approached and directly hit the Big Island. The Waikahe and Pahoa Wards of our Hilo Hawaii Stake were particularly hard hit. Miraculously, there were no reports of deaths or damages to homes. All missionaries were safe and accounted for. Church buildings in Hilo and Pahoa were used as shelters. Many homes and communities were cut off from access to power and communications due fallen trees blocking the roads. On Friday evening at 9:30 PM, we established communications and made a plan to serve. At 12:30 PM on Saturday, August 9, 2014, Member and non-member volunteers from around the island, including members from the Kona stake, separated into groups of eight to ten people at the Orchidland Chapel. There were two chainsaws per group. Volunteers then went throughout the streets in the community where trees had not yet been cleared and moved debris. At 4 PM, the service project came to an end. I witnessed firsthand what Relief Society General President Linda K. Burton phrased, “First observe, then serve.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I experienced two tender moments while serving the Puna Community and Saints that I would like to share. The first house we helped looked like a war zone. You could not see the front entrance into the house. It took us a couple of hours to remove debris and repair the walkway to the house of this widow. I was hot and sweaty and probably didn’t look like the stake president. At the conclusion of our service and as we said our good byes, this poor sister finally recognized that the stake president was there, all hot and sweaty from working in her yard. She was so touched and moved that her stake president would come to her house to help her. The depth of her emotion touched me deeply. The last house we visited was to an active sister and less-active brother, both in their later years. Their backyard was a tangle of broken albezia branches. The tree branches that fell had crushed their chain link fence as if it had been warm butter. With much effort, we cleaned every branch that had fallen into their yard. Upon our saying good bye, this less-active brother gave me the warmest hug. In his hug, I felt the sweet love of our Savior. It was a purifying experience that changed me for the better. I know that we have a loving Father in Heaven who wants us to move forward in our lives despite temporary and long-term hardship.</p>
<p>Now, whether I saw them or not, there were always sharks in the water. The first time that I realized that a shark was in the water with me was in Hanalei Bay on the island of Kauai. We had been working for two days, and on the third day, I saw it swimming nearby. It was only three to four feet long, but for a first timer seeing a shark, it could have been fourteen feet long. I immediately swam to the captain. I didn't even realize that I had instinctively climbed into the boat. The captain nearly exploded seeing me there. He yelled so loud for me to jump back in the water that I wasn't sure what was scarier, the shark or the captain. The next day was Sunday, and our captain kept the Sabbath day holy. I stayed in my cabin and had my personal sacrament service. I was the main speaker, and there was even a special soloist. The rest of the crew, who were not members of the Church, swam out to Hanalei town for the day. I had considered all day after seeing the shark about giving up this whole capital adventure. Was earning money for my mission worth the risk? I decided to talk to the captain. As I sat with the captain, ready to tell him that I was going to swim to the airport, I confided in him that I was terrified of sharks, and then I felt inspired to ask him to give me a priesthood blessing. In the blessing, he told me that I had a mission to perform and that I would need all my limbs to perform my mission. He then promised me that not a hair of my head would be damaged from working on the boat and that I would serve with all my fingers and toes intact. During the ensuing months, there wasn't a time when there wasn't a shark in the water with me. I had some pretty close calls. By close, I mean that while I was working, a shark swam just inches away from my nose. I am happy to report that I stand before you today with all my fingers and toes. I pray that you and I will always courageously rely on priesthood power.</p>
<p>Another time when my guardian angels were frantically working hard to keep me safe from harm was on a trip to Maui. I would like to share with you this experience in the hopes that it will hopefully save someone from future pain and sorrow. The moral of the lesson is to stay away from dangerous things, even if you feel the danger is unwarranted. On this particular trip, we had completely surrounded a nice school of akule fish with our nets. Unbeknownst to us, we had surrounded the wrong school of fish, and we had to retract our nets as quickly as possible. In haste, we quickly pulled our nets back into the boat, and in doing so, a small shark about two feet long was pulled up with the net right into the waiting arms of myself and another curious coworker of mine. Thinking it was dead, we grabbed it by the tail and pulled the limp form out of the water to inspect it. The skin was scratchy and gray. The underside was white. It had yellow eyes. It was one of the most curious things I had ever seen. I really wanted to see the teeth up close. However, the captain saw us goofing around and sent a barking command to throw it back in the water just as I went to open its mouth with my bare hands. When the captain speaks, you quickly obey. My friend did a double swing and threw that shark about 30 feet into the water away from us. As we stood there watching it sink into the ocean, our “dead” shark amazingly wiggled for a second and swam away! I always think about what might have happened that day if I had stuck my fingers into its mouth. The moral of the lesson is to stay away from dangerous things, even if you feel the danger is unwarranted. In a 1976 address, President Boyd K. Packer talked about <em>spiritual crocodiles</em><sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;that can kill or mutilate souls and destroy peace of mind. Beware of dangerous things even if they may not appear dangerous. You will be warned by the Holy Ghost beforehand. Said President Packer, "If you will listen to the counsel of your parents and your teachers and your leaders when you are young, you can learn how to follow the best guide of all—the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. That is individual revelation. There is a process through which we can be alerted to spiritual dangers. Just as surely as that guide warned me, you can receive signals alerting you to the spiritual crocodiles that lurk ahead."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, one of the things I learned from being in the ocean is that there are sharks all around us even when we may not know it or see them. On one fishing trip in particularly murky water, I could feel the sharks swimming around me, but I couldn't see them. It wasn't until the end of the day when we were scooping fish into the boat that we came across the sharks. We pulled out one shark, and then two more, and then two more. I couldn't believe my eyes! Likewise, in our lives there are sharks everywhere. Spiritual sharks that would kill or mutilate our souls. We should never knowingly play with sharks. We must recognize spiritual sharks in our lives for what they are and get out of the water as fast as possible. Stay away from pornography and its companion, masturbation. Never be alone with a member of the opposite sex; in fact, never be alone, period. Stay far away from dangerous substances that would enslave you. Fortunately, the Atonement of the Great Redeemer, who is Christ, can heal those that have been already been bitten or maimed. I testify of the power of the Atonement. I know that His power can heal anything that which is broken. I know that He loves us and wants us to be happy. I pray that we will make "Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and, indeed, the very core of <em>who we</em> are.”</p>
<p>The most important lesson that I learned while working as a fisherman is to always listen to the captain. There is an old saying: “When the captain says to jump, you ask how high.” As a member of our crew, when the captain said jump, you didn't even ask why. The meaning of this phrase is that the captain knows that it's going to be hard and that we'll be in dangerous situations and that his crew must follow every order or instruction to perfection. We had to trust that the captain had a plan and knew exactly what needed to be done. Our safety and our very lives were in his hands. The captain normally sits on the boat and has a vantage point out of the water where he can see things we cannot. When he gives a command and we obey, the job goes smoother and at the end of the day, we are one step to closer to being done with our fishing trip. We were one step closer to getting back home. Likewise, we each have a captain in our lives who has a plan for us. He knows and loves us perfectly and has a plan for our happiness. He is the great and almighty king of heaven and earth. He knows the beginning from the end and our eternal welfare is His work and His glory. "Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;When we follow His plan, we find ourselves in a safe harbor. We can be assured that we are safe and that at the end of the day, we are one step closer to Him and our eternal home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I learned the following lessons that still apply in my life today. They are <br /> 1. Tie yourself down and hold firmly to the Iron Rod<br /> 2. Mend your nets constantly<br /> 3. Always keep moving forward <br /> 4. Rely courageously on priesthood power<br /> 5. Don't play with dangerous things <br /> 6. Trust the captain and follow His plan</p>
<p>I know that God lives and that He loves us. I know we are His children. That makes each of us special to Him. I know that He wants us to be happy in our lives. I know that He has a plan. When we follow that plan, we will prosper. I know that the darkness of this world is very real. I know that each of us can grasp the Iron Rod. May we have the courage and determination to never let go. I know that continuing your education is an honorable endeavor. Don't give up.</p>
<p>Indelibly burned into my mind is the hallway of the McKay Building leading from the Library to the Cafeteria. Sometimes, I still walk its hallway in my dreams at night and wake up thinking I am late for a test. It was in this hallway that I felt the confirming answer of the Lord that my choice to attend BYU–Hawaii was sanctioned by Him. I had a testimony that I was doing what the Lord wanted me to do by attending school to further my education. I realized that I wasn't just attending school for me. I was really on the Lord's errand. I testify that when you are on the Lord's errand, you are entitled to the Lord's blessings. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>October 21, 2014<br />Kevin Kimball<br />Associate Professor of Accounting<br />Director of the Center for Learning and Teaching<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>In January of 1997, my family and I were living in Luxembourg where I was working as an auditor for Deloitte &amp; Touche.</p>
<p>January is the front end of what auditors refer to as “busy-season.” In our family, Teresa and I would start busy season by pulling out our calendar and planning a really fun vacation for the end of busy-season. Then we would take a deep breath, plunge in, and hang on until the end of March when we would come up for air and escape to that that long-awaited vacation.</p>
<p>As usual, this busy season was busy. Except for Mondays for family night and Saturdays and Sundays, I would rarely see my kids awake because I would leave for work before they got up and return after they had gone to bed. One night, I got home particularly late, feeling a bit more stress than usual, so I greeted Teresa, who was finalizing a sewing project, and then chose to de-stress myself by sitting down and reading the Church News. The messages were great, and as the minutes passed, I felt myself begin to relax. As I reached the back of the issue, the following position announcement jumped off the page at me: “<strong>BYU–HAWAII Assistant or associate professor of accounting.</strong>”<strong></strong></p>
<p>I immediately called over to Teresa and said, “Hey, what do you think about this, an Accounting Professor Position at BYU–Hawaii.” To Teresa’s credit and my eternal gratitude, her resounding reply was “I’m there!” I then fired an email off to Bruce Kimzey, and after a couple setbacks, we were at BYU–Hawaii interviewing for the position, and a few months after that, we were packing up our three little children and all of our worldly belongings for a 24-hour flight to Hawaii. I have never regretted what seemed to be a very spur-of-the-moment, life-altering, career-altering decision to effectively say, “Count me in!” to teaching at BYU–Hawaii, a decision that has changed my life and that of my wife and my children for the better.</p>
<p>I often think about that night and how clear it seemed to me and to Teresa that this would be the right thing to do. Naturally, some people would say, “Well of course Hawaii sounded good. You were working long-stressful hours, it was below freezing outside, you weren’t seeing your kids very much, etc. etc. Of course Hawaii sounded good.” However, our motivation felt deeper than that. We felt a spiritual confirmation that at this point in time, the Lord needed us somewhere else and through various means was asking if we wanted to be counted in. Soon after we arrived in Hawaii and after the excitement of moving here had settled down, we realized that saying “Count me in” is easier than sacrificing and working to “be counted in,” but both are necessary. To Teresa’s credit, what really made our move here work out so well was that she was willing to follow-up her words with the necessary sacrifices and required work to be counted in.</p>
<p>It is this willingness to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">say</span></strong> “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Count me in!</span>” AND then the ability to make the sacrifices and put in the work to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BE</span></strong> counted in that I would like to talk about today. These abilities are particularly critical as we seek to fulfill our role in four key areas: 1) the Plan of Salvation, 2) our education, 3) our dating, marriage, and family lives, and 4) the Atonement.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Plan of Salvation</strong></p>
<p>Many moons ago, in fact, even before our moon was created, we all participated in the Council in Heaven. In this council, Heavenly Father proposed a Plan of Salvation, also known as the Plan of Happiness, which would allow each of us to come to earth, receive bodies, and be tested to see if we would be true and faithful to the covenants we would make with Him so that we could return to Him and receive eternal salvation. I believe that as Heavenly Father presented His Plan, He made it clear that in order for us to truly grow and become more like Him, we would need to have free agency and to learn how to act for ourselves, “to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">2 Nephi 10:23</a>).</p>
<p>As the Council in Heaven progressed, two of His sons, Jesus Christ and Lucifer, as Satan was then called, offered to carry out Heavenly Father’s plan.</p>
<p>“And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first,” whom we know to have been Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Abraham 3:27</a>).</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ offered to carry out God’s plan, He indicated His wholehearted willingness to carry out God’s plan as God envisioned it, for he said, “Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Moses 4:2</a>).</p>
<p>In other words, Christ said, “Count me in.” Christ gave no qualifiers, made no stipulations, and proposed no adjustments to God’s plan. Christ was “ALL IN” exactly as God desired.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when Satan made his offer, his proposal came with qualifiers, stipulations, and proposed adjustments to God’s plan. His words were “Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Moses 4:1</a>).</p>
<p>Satan wanted to become the Plan’s CEC, its Chief External Controller. Under Satan’s system for carrying out Heavenly Father’s plan, we would have only been required to <strong>SAY</strong> “Count me in,” then sit back and let Satan’s system of external controls take care of the rest. Satan’s system was not to be a system of free agency but rather one of external controls that would have prevented our spirits from learning how to master the natural man, to sacrifice, and to work to develop obedience and faithfulness, all of which is necessary in order for us to become like our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>“Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, … I caused that he should be cast down” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Moses 4:3</a>).</p>
<p>Satan told us the biggest lie of all; he told us that all we had to do was <strong>SAY</strong> “Count me in,” and we would have been saved without any additional sacrifice or work on our parts. This was a lie because it was contrary to God’s plan; however, this lie was enticing enough to “a third part of the hosts of heaven” that they turned away from Heavenly Father, “And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.36-37?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">D&amp;C 29:36-37</a>).</p>
<p>Now, here is the point I would like to make: none of us who has ever lived on the earth or whoever will live on the earth bought Satan’s lie, that saying “Count me in” would be enough for our eternal salvation. We desired our free agency. We wanted to make choices. We wanted to grow. We wanted to be obedient. We wanted to grow in faith. We wanted to work and to show through our words AND our obedient actions that we would follow the Savior and hopefully be able to return to Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>So, we all made it to earth; we all passed the first test by saying “Count me in” on the Plan of Salvation and have thereby kept our first estate.</p>
<p>Now is our probationary state when the real challenge begins. Will we be able to follow-through on what we said in our pre-mortal commitment and BE counted in? Will we develop faith? Will we repent? Will we be baptized and enter into the other saving ordinances and enter the related covenants? Will we strive to keep the commandments? Will we continue to repent and endure to the end? Only time will tell. The challenge is that none of us knows how long our time on earth will last, so the best option is to live in a manner so that we can <strong>Be</strong> counted in each and every day through our words and our actions or, as President Hinckley has said, “May we go forward with determination to try a little harder to be a little better.”</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Our Education</strong></p>
<p>Many of you have heard that “The glory of God is intelligence” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:36</a>). Well, I don’t know about you, but I have had times in my life where I didn’t feel like the intelligence I possessed was doing much to increase God’s glory. Let me share with you a couple personal stories that reveal my former misunderstandings of intelligence.</p>
<p>My early elementary school years in Southern California were happy, fun, and very active. I enjoyed school, but in contrast to my good friends, I wasn't very academically gifted. For example, one of my earliest childhood memories was in Mrs. Breitenberger’s kindergarten class where we were expected to learn our numbers and our letters. As soon as we could prove to our teacher that we knew all our numbers and our letters, our teacher would write our name on a paper astronaut and tape it to the classroom wall in chronological order of achievement. What this meant is that anyone could walk into our classroom and immediately see who the "smart" kids were and by default know who the “smart” kids were not. If I remember correctly, my good friend Ralphy's astronaut was one of the very first astronauts to go up on the wall and begin its year-long space-walk of glory. I am confident that my astronaut also wanted to float along the wall, but a few letters, particularly the letter J, seemed to conspire against me and my astronaut who remained in my teacher’s drawer. My difficulties with the letter J became particularly embarrassing when I crafted a love note to Julie, with the J spelled backwards. Gratefully, I was finally able to master my “J’s” and liberate my astronaut from my teacher’s drawer so that he could enjoy his short-lived float of glory. Although I was only six at the time, this experience started to worry me. I thought, “Maybe I don't have what it takes; maybe I am just not smart enough.”<br /> <br /> Well, school continued, and my friend Ralphy continued to excel, and I continued to just get by, revealing to me, or so I interpreted, my below-average intelligence. My feeling of inadequacy hit me really strongly on report card day in second grade when I was almost eight years old. Both Ralphy and I had just received our report cards and decided it would be a good idea to compare them. I was wrong. It was not a good idea. Our school's grading structure assigned +'s for above average work, 0's for average work, and -'s for below average work. Ralphy's report card was flush with +’s. On the other hand, my report card was littered with 0's and -'s. I soon said goodbye to Ralphy, crossed the street to my home, and entered my front door feeling quite dejected. I may even have been crying; I don’t recall. Whatever my disposition was, my mother noticed that I wasn't my normally cheerful self and asked, "Kevin, what is the matter?&nbsp;You seem a little sad."&nbsp;I then broke down and told my mom about all the +'s Ralphy had and about all the 0's and -'s I had. I then expressed my concern that I must really be stupid. My mother then changed my life. She sat me down, looked me in the eye, and gave me some valuable advice. She said, "Ralphy IS a very smart boy. That's OK. Maybe for you, you might just need to work a little harder."&nbsp; However she said it, it rang true to me. Maybe I didn’t understand things as fast as the next person, BUT I knew I could try a little harder to do a little better to learn a little more. I knew I really wasn’t giving my best effort in school and could do better to focus on learning, so I buckled down, as much as an active eight-year old, soccer-loving boy could do, and tried harder, began to learn more, and my results started to improve. I came to really love learning and have continued to strive to learn each and every day. To this day, I know I still don’t have the highest IQ, but I have learned how to work hard, and I have learned how to learn some reasonably difficult things. By so doing, I have also been able to assist others in learning reasonably difficult things.</p>
<p>Some of you may currently be going through some emotions that you thought you would never have. Several months ago, you were thrilled to receive confirmation that you were admitted to study at BYU–Hawaii. After waiting for so long, you couldn’t believe it. You finally got accepted and would soon be on campus ready to start your university education. But now, after only a couple months, you are sitting in your classes figuratively imagining all these astronauts floating along the classroom walls but none of them have your name on them because you are still stuck on backward “J’s,” and your astronaut is still sitting in your professor’s drawer. Now is a dangerous time in your academic career because you risk thinking that you are not very intelligent when in fact possibly what you need is little more focused and effective effort or some properly guided learning assistance.</p>
<p>Please do not give up on yourselves. Our campus has plenty of learning resources in the student Counseling Center, the Center for Academic Success, the Center for Learning and Teaching, the Reading/Writing Center, the Speech Lab, the Accounting and various other tutoring labs, and your professors. Each and every BYU–Hawaii professor has office hours set aside for you each week specifically dedicated to help you learn. Please don’t underestimate the value of sitting face-to-face with your professor and receiving his or her help in your learning process. Your professors want to help you, and I don’t think anything makes teaching professors happier than seeing their students learn and succeed. Please take full advantage of your professors’ office hours; you will be glad you did.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I set out to paint lines at Laie Park for a new sport called Pickleball. Within minutes of laying out the masking tape and pulling out my yellow traffic paint and paint rollers, I had 15 kids under the age of ten saying, “Hey uncle, I like try.” Based on their level of fascination with the painting process, I doubt a single one of them had ever used a paint roller in his life, but due to their eagerness to help and their willingness to learn, I chose to change my focus from painting Pickleball lines to helping children learn. I quickly realized it was more important to validate and encourage the children’s innate desire to serve and to learn than it was to paint perfect Pickleball lines. The kids were great. They very dutifully lined up and one-by-one and took turns dipping the rollers in the paint and rolling out the lines. Kids are naturally born with a love for learning. If you feel you have lost that love for learning, seek to regain it by trying something totally new in a safe, loving environment. If I could express one hope in my new responsibilities in the Center for Learning and Teaching, it would be that each of our classrooms become a safe and loving environment but also an environment that challenges each of us to live up to our potential.</p>
<p>On the topic of learning, Elder Bednar said, “When I was younger, I thought education meant going to school, taking tests, and getting good grades. But as I grew older, I began to learn the difference between doing well in school and becoming educated. A person can do well on tests and still not be educated. True education is learning how to learn. Once I discovered that lesson, learning became fun.”</p>
<p>I hope that when each of us are presented with new and challenging opportunities to learn, that we will say “Count me in!” or as my junior associates said, “Hey uncle, I like try,” and then seize the opportunity to sacrifice, to work hard, and to learn, for the Glory of God is intelligence, the intelligences that we are AND the intelligence we can develop through the learning process. Both are essential to God’s glory.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Our Dating, Marriage, and Family Lives</strong></p>
<p>A few years after my mission, I found myself at BYU progressing toward a master’s degree in accounting. I was working, studying, being active in Church, and dating, but I was dating to date. I was not dating to get married, and yes, there is a definite difference between the two. As I look back on that time, I don’t think I had really made the decision to say “Count me in!” on marriage. Although I had told myself that I would like to get married, I hadn’t committed that I would make myself ready to be married; I wasn’t sure I was ready to be “Counted in.”</p>
<p>One night in the spring of 1989, Brian Watkins, my freshman floor mate and a current BYU–Hawaii accounting professor, invited me over for dinner with his wife Cindi and with Ray Richmond, my freshman roommate, and his wife Alicia. You single guys probably already perceive the predicament I was in. As I looked forward to the dinner, I was already anticipating an awkward evening talking about marriage, babies, pregnancy, strollers, diapers etc. and was wondering who I knew that would enjoy going with me and would be able handle the situation well. While contemplating my options, I decided to invite Teresa. Teresa and I had become friends a couple years earlier when we were in the same ward and on the same inner tube water polo team with three of my siblings and some other friends. Gratefully, she accepted the dinner invitation.</p>
<p>As I correctly imagined, the dinner conversation did turn toward marriage, babies, pregnancy, strollers, diapers, etc., but to her credit, Teresa handled it quite well in spite of this being only our second date in two years. As the conversation continued about married life, it then turned toward housing, at which point Cindi turned toward “us” and asked, “Have you two started looking for housing yet?” We both chuckled, jokingly scooted a little closer, and said, “No, no, not yet.” The rest of the dinner passed without a hitch. After that, we went to ward prayer, and as we arrived, we walked up the stairs arm-in-arm, still playing it up as if we were “an item.”</p>
<p>But, something happened to me that night. The ice was broken. I finally realized deep down in my heart, what I already knew in my head, that the dating scene was designed to lead to something more serious. It was not meant to be an eternal means of entertaining yourself on the weekend when you were done with work and were tired of studying. The Lord expected more out of the process, and, for the first time in my life, I decided to say “Count me in” on it.</p>
<p>After that, dating did change for me. I wish I could say that it lead to a smooth and quick marriage to Teresa, my dream girl, but it didn’t. In between that first second date and our eventual marriage, we both dated other people seriously, but gratefully, in Part 3 of our relationship, it all came together and we were married in the Los Angeles Temple right in the middle of my last semester of my Master’s program.</p>
<p>I realize there are many factors that impact the timing of marriage, but I can say that for me, and probably some of you, particularly you young men, I was hampering that timing in my life because I had not yet decided to say “Count me in” and then make the sacrifices and put in the work to BE counted in. For me, my relationship with Teresa only truly began to progress toward marriage AFTER I had decided that I was ready to get married and tried to follow-through with the wholesome, three-pillar dating strategy referred to by Steve Tueller in his excellent Devotional talk a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>So, yes, Teresa and I both did say “Count me in” to our marriage, and we were married in the temple, but was that it? Was that all we needed to do was say: “Yes, count me in” and our eternal marriage would be made sure? Did we make it? Not by a long shot. In fact, we are still working on “making it,” and we will be forever. It was only after we said “Yes” across the altar of the temple that the real hard work needed to live up to our temple marriage covenants could even begin.</p>
<p>Both of us have had to roll up our sleeves and put in some good solid effort to make our marriage work. It is clear to me that in the bliss of the dating that lead up to our marriage, we did not fully comprehend the amount of hard work it would take to live up to the loving covenants we made in the temple. But, after almost 25 years of marriage, we are still together. We have six wonderful children and one wonderful daughter-in-law, and we still need to work hard at our relationship every single day. For example, some of you may have seen us in the mornings riding our tandem bike out to Kahuku, talking and listening all the way out and back. That tandem bike has been great couple’s therapy for us. Every couple needs to find something that keeps their conversation and love going, and this is one thing that has worked for us. I will be eternally grateful for both our decisions to say “Count me in” to our marriage, and I am personally very grateful for Teresa’s commitment to me, to her temple covenants, and to the Lord that she would be willing to put in the hard work to stay with me to help fulfill them.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Atonement</strong></p>
<p>When we asked to be counted in on the Plan of Salvation and chose to keep our first estate, we expressed our willingness to receive the blessings of Christ’s Atonement so that we could keep our second estate and return to Him. Each and every one of us knew, in advance, even before setting foot on earth, that we would commit sins and “fall short of the Glory of God” (Romans 3:23). We knew that we would need a Savior to atone for our sins, and we knew that our Savior would be Jesus Christ. As spirit children, we may even have been able to observe Christ’s Atonement. I don’t know, but I do believe that before the veil of forgetfulness was pulled over each of our eyes, we already knew that Jesus Christ had kept His promise and backed up His words by fully atoning for our yet uncommitted sins. His part of the Plan of Salvation is fulfilled. Our part is in the works. Before coming to earth, we said “Count me in” on the blessings of the Atonement, but our words will mean nothing if we don’t follow through with the requisite faith and repentance so that even though our sins were as scarlet, they may be white as snow.</p>
<p>As a single student bishop, I had the opportunity to help some of my ward members remember their desire to be counted in on the redeeming power of the Atonement. They would come in to see me with what seemed to be a backpack full of burdens resulting from prior sins and transgressions. The burdens they carried weighed down their spirits and correspondingly their studies, their social life, their activity in the Church, their work, and their self-confidence such that they were neither receiving the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">redeeming</span></strong> power of the Atonement nor the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">enabling</span></strong> power of the Atonement. However, through humility, pure repentance, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and good old-fashioned hard work, the power of the Atonement healed them, and the Spirit returned. I felt so blessed to be able to witness the miracle of forgiveness in their lives.</p>
<p>I know that each of us desired to be counted in on the Lord’s Atonement when we chose to come to earth. Now that we are here, we have the opportunity to follow through on that desire. The Lord is waiting and ready to embrace us as we return to Him. I pray that each of us will choose to not only say the words “Count me in” but to take the actions that will allow us to <strong>BE</strong> counted in on His Atonement and thereby be numbered among His fold.</p>
<p>In summary, before coming to earth, we chose to be counted in on the Plan of Salvation, to become educated, to marry and raise a family, and to receive the blessings of the Atonement in our lives. The life we live now will show whether we will live up to our desires to be counted in. God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, church leaders, friends, and family are all available to help us along the way to ensure we are counted in.</p>
<p>I pray that when each of us are resurrected and brought before the judgment seat of God that each of us will be able to say “Lord, please count me in” and that the heavenly gates will swing wide on our behalf.</p>
<p>God is counting on us. I pray that we may all choose to be counted in and act in a manner that will allow us to be counted in on the Plan of Salvation; on our education; on our dating, marriage, and family lives; and on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Remembrance constructs our place in the world. Our awareness of a consistent self relies on a web of memories that represent our relationships and our past. Included in these memories are products of our socialization, the norms and values of the societies where we live. Many times each day, we refer to such memories as we interpret the social events around us and choose our own behaviors. The system works so well that it’s almost invisible—we don’t know what we’ve got until it’s gone. Through memory loss, we may lose the context that provides what we might call an individual’s social positioning. The resulting disorientation can be socially and emotionally devastating. I wrote the following about my mother-in law in 2002:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My mother-in-law is a person with Alzheimer’s disease. She is at the point in the progression of the disease where she struggles with anterior grade amnesia—she is unable to reliably lay down memory traces in the present. She can’t really tell you who visited yesterday or what she had for breakfast. Of course, the disease is progressive, and she has struggled for many years with the foibles of memory that nearly everyone endures as they age. But this last year, a new and most unwelcome memory disruption has appeared: retrograde amnesia—the inability to remember the past. This latter is much more disruptive, not so much disruptive of daily life but of my mother-in-law’s sense of self. The disease is in the process of cutting off access to her memories so that the voices of both distant and recent past go unheard. My father-in-law Duward died five years ago, and her memory of him is faltering. My mother-in-law asks over and over to whom she is/was married:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now tell me, where is Dad?”&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“He’s dead Mom; he died five years ago.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“But, I’m married to Duward, right?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Yes, but Dad died five years ago.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“But now I’m married to Duward, right?” And so it goes, over and over, and over. We always try to explain. Why is it so important? It is because she is trying to hold on to her husband, the most important memory in her life. If she can’t produce this memory of memories, then her self is truly diminished, even lost. So she struggles, struggles to retain selfhood. When one has no accumulation of knowledge that is the past, identity wavers and self is undermined. So we answer my mother-in-law’s questions, over and over. I know it is a losing battle; so does she. But she fights, and we with her. Soon the disease will claim more of her—who we are, finally who she is. The self will be gone before she dies. My mother-in-Law died in 2007 and is reunited with her husband.</p>
<p>In the same way, memory activities construct who we are spiritually. Perhaps most important, as we partake of the sacrament each week, we covenant to always remember the Savior, but many other memories are essential for orienting ourselves within the framework that is the Gospel. For example, we hold memories of doctrine taught to us by our parents, friends, or missionaries. We’ve also learned and remember much by attending Sabbath meetings, firesides, and perhaps seminary. Our study of the scriptures has created a web of memories, and the words of modern prophets, including our current leaders, collectively orient us in our religious experience. Finally, the history of the Restoration provides us with a collective memory of God’s dealings with His church in recent times. It is interesting that when a person joins the Church, this history is added to their potential store of meaningful memories. And these are just a sampling of the possible spiritually relevant memories that influence us on a daily basis. Remembrance is important. I’d like to speak about four ways in which remembrance frames and orders our religious experience and our relationship with God. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. First, remembrance is essential for repentance.</strong></p>
<p>I suppose there are some who have been taught, have repented, and have lived with such dedication that little ongoing repentance is needed. For myself, and I’m supposing many of you, ongoing repentance is necessary. In order to do that, we must remember what we have been taught—commandments we’ve accepted and covenants we have made—and then develop the desire to once again live righteously. As I said before, our memories provide order in our lives. When we sin, we shuffle our priorities and ignore commandments that in the past have brought us happiness. Remembering the things we have been taught in our youth, or more recently, restores order and provides direction. Perhaps we’ve all had occasions where we put important, sacred things in second place only to realize later that we must reorganize our priorities to be consistent with eternal realities. The memories of such experiences are important. I’m not asking that we become paralyzed in reflecting on our past life, but I do want to point to the opportunities that our past provides for us. They give us context, mark the path we’ve been on, and help us so that we don’t end up needing to learn the same lessons over and over. As we hold these examples in remembrance, they may become turning points in our experience, the trophies where the tide changed in the battle for our souls. Let me give you an example of such a memory from my experience.</p>
<p>When I was in graduate school, I had an experience that taught me and changed me. It was near Christmas, and my wife and I had planned a series of special Family Home Evenings to try to tell the Christmas story to our then-young children in a way that would help them understand that Christmas is more than presents. I needed to do some preparation for this lesson. I had been working long hours, and this was a time to spend with my family. But, I was also looking for a job and had an opportunity that day to practice the presentation I would make at an upcoming job interview. The seminar where I could present met on Sunday evenings, and I needed to get ready. The events I’m describing took place over 35 years ago, but I still remember the frustration I felt over feeling so divided. I knew I should spend the time with my family, yet the job seemed so important. I probably gave a substandard FHE presentation, but what I really remember was an awful presentation to the job seminar. The Lord clearly left me to my own abilities, and on that evening, they were insufficient. Afterwards, I knew that I had made a significant mistake and that the feeling of being divided was really because I was distracted from what mattered most.</p>
<p>The feeling of being divided, of being separated, is important. I was separated from my family, but even more importantly, I was separated from God. Thirty-five years later, I realize that feeling of separation is both a <strong>symptom</strong> and a <strong>warning</strong>. A <strong>symptom</strong> because it showed my condition before God. The Lord wants all of our attention. He has made it clear that our spouse and our families are our first priority. A <strong>warning </strong>because God didn’t want me to remain in this separated state. The warning is a call to action, a call to become one with God, a call to become one again with our families. The memory of that experience is precious to me. I certainly haven’t always avoided feelings of separation, but I know that such feelings signal an opportunity for change and improvement. Remembrance is necessary for repentance.</p>
<p><strong>2. A second type of remembrance is of what we might call “revelatory moments.”</strong></p>
<p>These are experiences that serve as anchors for our faith and hope. Accounts of such revelatory moments are found in the scriptures. For example, consider the Lord’s word’s to Oliver Cowdry in the 6<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants. In the revelation, the Lord provided an additional assurance to Oliver that the words that he had been writing were true. Then He provided this additional witness, referring Oliver to a previous spiritual experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, &nbsp;that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, behold, you have received a witness; for if I have told you things which no man knoweth have you not received a witness? (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.22-24?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">D&amp;C 6:22-24</a>)</p>
<p>Many of us have been blessed to enjoy the ministry of the Holy Ghost to some extent in our lives. Although intense spiritual experiences don’t automatically affect us over the years, those memories can connect us to our core knowledge and beliefs even during times when we struggle. Spiritual experiences are renewed with <strong>remembrance. </strong>Think back on the way you gained your testimony. If you aren’t the first generation in the Church, ask your parents or grandparents how they gained their testimonies.</p>
<p>As a young teenager I remember watching my mother read the scriptures each night before she went to sleep. I remember another occasion when she was preparing a Relief Society theology lesson with the scriptures laid out around her. I asked her about how she gained her testimony, and I clearly remember her response. She said, “I have studied the scriptures sufficiently that I know.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That emotional and spiritual memory is important to me. I remember the room, my mother’s tone of voice, the look in her eyes. Likewise, my own testimony is grounded in the scriptures. Such spiritual memories are important occasions that carry deep significance for us as individuals and for our families. Such memories may connect us to our faithful progenitors, to the early members of the Church for whom the Restoration was such a light, and ultimately to the Savior.</p>
<p>Years ago, my family attended a Stake Conference in South Carolina where Elder Neal A. Maxwell was the visiting General Authority. The sessions were wonderful, and the Spirit very strong. Just before Elder Maxwell spoke in the final general session, we sang “How Great Thou Art,” an old evangelical hymn in our current hymnal that is a favorite of saints in the South. The Spirit was especially strong during the singing, and many individuals, including me, shed tears. At the conclusion of Elder Maxwell’s address, he gave the assembled congregation an Apostolic blessing in which he promised us that when we would hear the hymn we had sung, we would remember the feelings of the Spirit that we had experienced that day. I don’t know about others, but it has been so for me, if I pray and claim the blessing that was given me. Such events don’t happen frequently, but many of us have had precious occasions when we’ve interacted with the Spirit. If we pray and seek to remember these occasions, their significance is renewed in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you haven’t had such “revelatory moments,” listen to David O. McKay’s experiences as a young teenager:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I thought that the only way a person could get to know the truth was by having a revelation or experiencing some miraculous event, just as came to the Prophet Joseph. One day I was hunting cattle … [and] an intense desire came over me to receive a manifestation of the truth of the restored gospel. I dismounted, threw my reins over my horse's head, and there, under a serviceberry bush, I prayed that God would declare to me the truth of his revelation to Joseph Smith. I am sure that I prayed fervently and sincerely and with as much faith as a young boy could muster. At the conclusion of the prayer, I arose from my knees, threw the reins over my faithful pony's head, and got into the saddle. As I started along the trail again, I remember saying to myself: "No spiritual manifestation has come to me. If I am true to myself, I must say I am just the same 'old boy' that I was before I prayed." The Lord did not see fit to give me an answer on that occasion, but in 1899, after I had been appointed president of the Scottish Conference, the spiritual manifestation for which I had prayed as a boy in my teens came as a natural sequence to the performance of duty. (General Conference, Oct. 1968)</p>
<p>President McKay enjoins us to patience in things spiritual and points to a natural unfolding of revelation in our lives as we fulfill our responsibilities in the gospel. Viewed in this way, revelatory moments take a position within the broader fabric of our lives. They take their meaning from that context, both in contrast to our everyday mundane experience but also as we come to see the spiritual <strong>in </strong>the mundane.</p>
<p>We all know of individuals who have experienced powerful revelatory moments but who have subsequently discounted them and fallen away. Simply experiencing revelatory moments doesn’t automatically assure our spiritual well-being. However, they do serve to strengthen our relationship with God. That process can recur through remembrance. In the words of BYU philosophy professor James Faulconer, our recollections allow us to <strong>re-collect</strong> ourselves. This usage is similar to one such as “The witness collected himself and continued with his presentation.” Collecting or re-collecting ourselves is a process that I think is akin to pushing a reset button on an appliance or rebooting a computer. Such re-collections allow us to prioritize our activities and even our relationships. Re-collection allows us to again place ourselves in spiritual order.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Third, we have remembrance of our experiences with and teachings from the scriptures.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>In thinking about our relationship to the scriptures, I find Elder Packer’s description of the Book of Mormon very helpful. He says, “It is the saga of a message, a testament. As the influence of that message is traced from generation to generation, more than twenty writers record the fate of individuals and of civilizations who accepted or rejected that testament” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/04/the-things-of-my-soul?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Things of My Soul</a>,” General Conference, Apr. 1986). Like Father Lehi’s family studying the brass plates, we too become a part of that saga by reading and studying. To one degree or another, we too accept or reject the testament of the scriptures.</p>
<p>If we accept and, in Nephi’s words, liken the scriptures to ourselves, the teachings become a part of our own lives. Pursued over time, we add to the saga for ourselves and create our own spiritual autobiography in the scriptures. Specific scriptures become touchpoints of council and comfort that are associated with events in our lives that have been exhilarating or challenging. Our own experiences are intertwined with scriptural accounts so that the memories of our lives are associated with those in the scriptural record. Specific individuals described in the scriptures become familiar friends and role models. But most importantly, the Savior becomes more a part of our lives.</p>
<p>As Nephi wrote the scriptures, he said that he wrote “the things of my soul.”&nbsp; The gems that we produce by likening the scriptures to ourselves are the things of our souls. It is the things of our souls that prepare us to face the spiritual struggles of life. These are the things that really matter, the source of our deepest joys and our most powerful armor against adversity.</p>
<p>If I can, let me share a few examples of the things of my soul.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart? (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.12-13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Mosiah 5:12-13</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I read this scripture, I always assess my progress. Is the Savior a stranger to me? Do I hold Him in my daily thoughts and deepest inner intents? The way to know Him is to serve Him, but our thoughts can be slippery. However, remembering to retain His name written in our hearts is both a stunning opportunity and a barrier against sin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Alma 7:12</a>)</p>
<p>In my weakness, to understand the degree to which I am known by Christ means everything to me.</p>
<p>My thought is that you too have created an autobiography in the scriptures—the things of your soul. You could each sit down with the scriptures and think back over verses that have guided you, inspired you, and comforted you. Spending time reading and pondering these special verses is a way to recall the reasons they were important in the first place. The things of our souls make the scriptures come alive and provide us with power to overcome adversity.</p>
<p><strong>4. Finally, we remember the Savior.</strong></p>
<p>We know it is through the ordinances that the power of Godliness is made manifest in our lives. Here is a quote from Elder Christofferson from General Conference:</p>
<p>Our covenant commitment to Him permits our Heavenly Father to let His divine influence, “the power of godliness” (<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/84/20#20" target="contentWindow">D&amp;C 84:20</a>), flow into our lives. He can do that because by our participation in priesthood ordinances we exercise our agency and elect to receive it. (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/the-power-of-covenants?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Power of Covenants</a>,” General Conference, Apr. 2009)</p>
<p>We each have memories of these events, but often we may take them for granted. In order to experience this power, we need to focus on the ordinances we have received. We can to prepare for our weekly experience with the sacrament and intentionally remember our baptism and additional ordinances if we have received them. Under the influence of the Holy Ghost, who can bring all things to our remembrance, memories of the covenants we have made with God are renewed and remain an active part of our lives. As we do that, we hold our spiritual experiences in remembrance. As we remember, we will be brought closer to Christ, to His sublime teaching, to His testimony of the father and of His own mission. Such memories are precious anchors.</p>
<p>In a devotional presented at BYU–Provo in 1974, when Ezra Taft Benson was President of the Quorum of the Twelve, he said the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A few years ago, we knew our Elder Brother and his and our Father in heaven well. We rejoiced at the upcoming opportunity for earthly life that could make it possible for us to have a fullness of joy as they had. We could hardly wait to demonstrate to our Father and our Brother, the Lord, how much we loved them and how we would be obedient to them in spite of the earthly opposition of the evil one. And now we’re here—our memories are veiled—and we’re showing God and ourselves what we can do. Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar his face is to us. (“<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=90" target="_blank">Jesus Christ–Gifts and Expectations</a>,” BYU Devotional, Dec. 1974)</p>
<p>The remembrance of our efforts to repent and become personally worthy, of our own revelatory experiences, and of weaving our own experience with the narratives, council, and testimony presented in the scriptures provides the opportunity to more fully bring the power of Godliness into our lives. I pray that through remembrance inspired by the Spirit, we can reach back and place ourselves in spiritual order and understand who we really are. God is not far, and the process of remembering brings Him closer. I bear you my witness that that is true in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other evening, Sister Warner and I were walking in our neighborhood and heard drums sounding in the distance. We were curious as to what was going on. We think it was probably a Polynesian show at a nearby hotel in which the men were performing. The drums sounded warlike. Having grown up in the Wild West, I was often drawn to movies or live presentations where we saw Native Americans doing war dances with the pounding of war drums.</p>
<p>Historically, drums have been used to muster troops and energize them for war and provide a cadence for marching and charging.</p>
<p>We figuratively hear war drums around the world. The beat seems to be increasing in volume. We hear them in Russia and Ukraine; we hear them in Israel and the Middle East; we hear them in Libya and Syria; we hear them in North Korea and in Africa; and we even hear them in Ferguson, Missouri. War drums have been sounding somewhere in the world since 1832 when Joseph Smith received the revelation on the impending Civil War in Section 87 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls; ... [A] time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at this place. For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall be poured out upon all nations” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.1-3?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">v. 1-3</a>).</p>
<p>Since the Civil War, there have been wars raging continuously somewhere on earth. Hundreds of wars have been fought, and more will be fought before the Savior comes again.</p>
<p>Section 87 of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants continues with the Lord forewarning:</p>
<p>“And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightening also, shall the inhabitants of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all nations; that the cry of the saints, and of the blood of the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, from the earth, to be avenged of their enemies.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.6,7?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">v. 6-7</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should we fear what is coming as we hear the drums of war? Where can we turn for peace in these times? The Lord gives us hope and specific instruction for finding peace in time of war when he states in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">verse 8</a>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Wherefore, <strong>stand ye in holy places, and be not moved</strong>, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord.”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, where are the holy places?</p>
<p>I believe there are three holy places where we can stand and be protected:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The House of the Lord</span></p>
<p>On the outside of every temple in the world are the words “The House of the Lord, Holiness to the Lord.” The temple is the first holy place I would like to discuss.</p>
<p>I recall the first time I went to the temple as a twelve-year old with my mutual group in 1961 to do baptisms for the dead. I had just been made a deacon. I knew little about the temple prior to this experience and was apprehensive. However, I knew my father and mother had been married there as had both sets of my grandparents. I loved them and knew that they would not want me to go if it was not in keeping with God’s wishes. As I entered the temple that winter day, I recall the feeling that came over me. It was like a warm blanket wrapping around me. I immediately felt at home in the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>It was with eager anticipation that I went to the temple in October of 1968 to receive my next ordinance: the endowment. I went with my parents. I had been taught nothing about the endowment prior to my going. There was no temple preparation class. My bishop and stake president had said very little to me as I interviewed for my temple recommend, explaining that we don’t talk about the temple experience outside of the temple. As I entered the temple, I recall feeling the warm blanket come over me once again—a feeling of being home and safe inside God’s Holy House. Although I didn’t remember much about that first temple endowment session and the covenants I made that day, I remember feeling acceptable to the Lord and being at peace in His temple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great joys of serving as mission president is reading letters from our recent converts recounting their conversion stories. They occasionally share their feelings about going to the temple for the first time to do baptisms for the dead and how they are able to feel the Spirit of the Lord so strongly in the temple. Brothers and sisters, we need the spirit of the temple in our lives on a regular basis.</p>
<p>President Hinckley taught, “Inside the temple a further sense of peace is experienced. The world is left behind with its clamor and rush. In the house of the Lord there is tranquility. Those who serve here know that they are dealing with matters of eternity. All are dressed in white. Speech is subdued. Thoughts are elevated.</p>
<p>“This is a sanctuary of service. Most of the work done in this sacred house is performed vicariously in behalf of those who have passed beyond the veil of death. I know of no other work to compare with it. It more nearly approaches the vicarious sacrifice of the Son of God in behalf of all mankind than any other work of which I am aware.” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/03/the-salt-lake-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Salt Lake Temple</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Mar. 1993.)</p>
<p>By keeping ourselves completely compliant with the requirements for entering the holy temples of God, we can be assured that we will be able to enter any of the 143 holy temples around the world. The Lord said, “Be not moved.” I believe the Lord is asking us to be in the temples often—even weekly if we are able. I know my life changed when I started attending the temple weekly. My personal revelation increased. Everything seemed to go better—my work, my family, my Church calling, and my relationships. I testify that yours will change for the better if you can be in the temple weekly, and you will find peace.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Home</span></p>
<p>The home is the second holy place I would like to discuss.</p>
<p>In the <em>Bible Dictionary</em> under “Temple,” it states, the temple is “a place where the Lord may come, it is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth. <strong>Only the home</strong> can compare with the temple in sacredness.”</p>
<p>One of our most beloved hymns teaches about the safety and peace we can find at home ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/love-at-home?lang=eng" target="_blank">Love at Home</a>," Hymn 294).</p>
<p>1. <em>There is beauty all around when there's love at home;<br />There is joy in ev'ry sound when there's love at home.<br />Peace and plenty here abide, smiling sweet on ev'ry side.<br />Time doth softly, sweetly glide when there's love at home.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Our homes can be sanctuaries from the drums of war if love prevails. I hope all of us have been in homes where there is a feeling of peace and tranquility. If you’ve received a patriarchal blessing, you likely felt peace and tranquility in the home of the patriarch.</p>
<p>One of our neighbors, an older couple who has since passed away, had such a home. As we entered their home, one or both of them greeted us with a cheerful smile. Their living room was simple, clean, and orderly. They always invited us to sit down and never seemed rushed. They had a few meaningful pictures on their walls—a family portrait, a favorite temple, and some lovely landscapes. Their home was full of light, and we could feel the Spirit in abundance. It reminded me of the simple elegance of the temple, and I desired my home to feel the same way.</p>
<p>Parents can teach children about the temple from pictures and talk about why the temple is so lovely. Families can learn the importance of picking up toys, clothing, and clutter, so the rooms in their homes will be clean, orderly, and peaceful just like those in the Lord’s house.</p>
<p>The Internet and television can be tremendous tools for learning, communicating, and enjoyment. However, constant media use can add to the chaos of a home. Peace can be stifled when the television or music is continuously playing in the background. Electronic media can be a hindrance to our feeling the Spirit in our homes if we are not vigilant. It becomes easier to forget the sacredness of our homes if we let the world dictate the spirit. Television should be a guest that is selectively invited into the home.</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar warned of these distractions in his CES talk on the BYU– Provo campus in May of 2009:</p>
<p>“I raise an apostolic voice of warning about the potentially stifling, suffocating, suppressing, and constraining impact of some kinds of cyberspace interactions and experiences upon our souls. The concerns I raise are not new; they apply equally to other types of media, such as television, movies, and music. But in a cyber world, these challenges are more pervasive and intense. I plead with you to beware of the sense-dulling and spiritually destructive influence of cyberspace technologies that are used to produce high fidelity and that promote degrading and evil purposes.” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2010/06/things-as-they-really-are?lang=eng" target="_blank">Things as They Really Are</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, June 2010.)</p>
<p>One gorgeous Sunday morning several years ago, I was driving to my parents’ home to say hello. It was a fall morning, the leaves were changing colors, and the sun was rising over the Wasatch Mountains. The neighborhood through which I was driving was peaceful and serene. No cars or people were on the street. I saw lovely homes with manicured yards that bespoke peace and harmony. They looked secure and safe from evil influences. A thought occurred to me. Satan has found a way to infiltrate these lovely homes in a most subtle way. We can invite him in through the media we select.</p>
<p>I know of a returned missionary who thought he could take a peek at some pornography and not be hurt. One peek led to another and another. Pretty soon he was staying late at work and telling his wife he had a project to finish. His thoughts soon turned into actions. Before long, his life was destroyed. He could find no peace. He lost his job. He nearly lost his wife and children. He lost his temple blessings, his priesthood, and his membership in the Church. After nearly seven years of missed blessings, he was rebaptized and a year later had his priesthood blessings and ordinances restored. It was a rugged eight-year road he had to walk – all for a peek. None of us can afford to peek. As disciples of Christ, we must stand firm for the values and virtues of clean living that the Gospel of Jesus Christ teaches.</p>
<p>We are the guardians of our homes. There is no commercial filter that will screen evil like our personal spiritual filter. May we protect the peace that can be found in a holy, sanctified home and be ever grateful if such a home is yours. If it is not, make changes today to make your homes holy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Hearts</span></p>
<p>The Lord has taught us that we will be blessed if we are peacemakers. In this world, when the drums of war are pounding, humanity longs for peacemakers—those who can go to the nations of the world carrying peace. In our homes, we need peacemakers. We hear of physical violence perpetrated against spouses, children, and other family members. When we lose our tempers, speak unkindly, or act out physically, love cannot abide in our hearts. A spirit of contention prevails over peace. Un-Christlike actions or words have no place in a sacred LDS home or in our hearts.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/51.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Psalms 51:10</a>, we read, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in Matthew, the Lord teaches us that “out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/12.34?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">Matthew 12:34</a>).</p>
<p>Several years ago, we had a recent convert from Italy visit us on his way to the MTC. He had been a boxer before joining the Church. This brother told us that as he began taking the missionary discussions, the Spirit of the Lord softened his heart. As he studied, pondered, and prayed, his faith grew. His desire to hit another man diminished. A spirit of love came into his heart that he had never known before, and he lost his desire to fight anyone again. He left boxing after he was baptized a member of the Church so that he could always retain the spirit of Christian love. His heart was prepared to accept a call to serve as a full-time representative of Christ.</p>
<p>Forgiveness can bring peace to a troubled heart. About a decade ago, I recall a remarkable story that appeared in the newspaper. In November of 2004, a 19-year old threw a frozen turkey from a speeding car through the windshield of Victoria Ruvolo’s oncoming car on a New York expressway. Waking after a two-week induced coma, Ruvolo asked where she was and if anyone was hurt, realizing she was in a hospital. When she looked in the mirror, she saw that she was the one hurt, having endured six hours of surgery to reconstruct her face. Weeks later, in court with her assailant, all expected her to request the maximum sentence for her attacker. To everyone’s astonishment, Ruvolo offered a plea deal for the young man. She forgave him for what he had done, allowing him to serve six months rather than 20 years in prison. She went to where he sat weeping, embraced him, and whispered in his ear, “I only want you to have a good life.” There wasn’t a dry eye in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Forgiveness can have a healing effect on our hearts that liberates us from terrible burdens. Vengeance is the Lord’s, not ours. Seeking for vengeance or retribution can spiritually destroy us. Forgiveness is something the Lord taught when he said, “If ye shall come unto me, or shall desire to come unto me, and rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee—Go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy brother and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.23,%2024?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">3 Nephi 12:23, 24</a>).</p>
<p>Forgiveness brings peace to the heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ are the solutions to most human ills and will quiet the personal drums of war in our lives and gladden our hearts. If we take time to study with real intent the Book of Mormon each day of our lives, we will receive the personal tutoring on how we can change our lives to become peacemakers rather than war mongers. President Boyd K. Packer stated, “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.”</p>
<p>If we are only going through the motions in our study of the Gospel of Christ, we are missing out on one of the greatest blessings we can enjoy as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are blessed to have truth when so much of the world is living in confusion and darkness. Christ taught us that we must feast upon the scriptures so that we may receive enlightenment and the wealth of knowledge and wisdom in order to know the mysteries of God. Sincere, consistent scripture study can bring us great personal peace in troubled times.</p>
<p>Our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, stated, “We must be vigilant in a world which has moved so far from that which is spiritual. It is essential that we reject anything that does not conform to our standards, refusing in the process to surrender that which we desire most: eternal life in the kingdom of God. The storms will still beat at our doors from time to time, for they are an inescapable part of our existence in mortality. We, however, will be far better equipped to deal with them, to learn from them, and to overcome them if we have the gospel at our core and the love of the Savior in our hearts. The prophet Isaiah declared, ‘The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever.’” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/10/stand-in-holy-places?lang=eng" target="_blank">Stand in Holy Places</a>," General Conference, Oct. 2011.)</p>
<p>We have been blessed with truth because in 1820, a young boy wanted to know which church he should join. He turned to the Lord in prayer and in response received a vision that changed the world. God and Jesus Christ appeared to the 14-year-old boy, Joseph Smith, and truth was revealed. God is literally our Father in Heaven—the Father of our spirits. Jesus Christ, our older brother and first-born of the Father, atoned for our sins, our pains and sufferings. Through His atoning sacrifice and our personal, sincere repentance, we can be forgiven and qualify to live in the presence of God again. In 2 Nephi 2:6-7, we read, “Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth. Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.”</p>
<p>Also, through Jesus Christ came the resurrection, giving us power to overcome physical death and receive immortal bodies.</p>
<p>I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and only through Him can we see God again. Through Joseph Smith was restored the Church of Jesus Christ, as He originally organized it when He was on the earth with apostles, prophets, Seventy, patriarchs, priests, teachers, and deacons. I testify that the priesthood and its attendant keys to perform the saving and exalting ordinances of the gospel were restored again through heavenly, resurrected messengers. We have a chain of continuous revelation that comes through living apostles and prophets through whom God can reveal His holy will. By studying and obeying their teachings, we will remain in the mainstream of the Church and find peace in a warring world.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we have the greatest tools for peace and happiness in life known to man. We have holy temples, we have our holy homes, and we have the gospel of Jesus Christ and its attendant ordinances that qualify us for eternal life—life with God. It speaks peace to our hearts. As members of God’s true church, we need to share this gospel of peace with the world. We have been told that “the thing which will be of most worth unto [us] will be to declare repentance unto this people, that [we] may bring souls unto Christ; that [we] may rest with them in the kingdom of [our] Father” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">D&amp;C 15:6)</a>.</p>
<p>May we share this gospel of peace with our friends, neighbors, and relatives. There is no greater time in the history of the world to be a missionary than right now, during the hastening. We have much to do to share the message of peace with all people of the earth. Please open you mouths and invite others to come unto Christ and find peace and rest in holy places, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>September 30, 2014<br />Steven W. Tueller<br />University Budget Director<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My wife mentioned in her introduction that I recently completed a book about our family. Reviewing almost thirty years of our family’s history reminded me over and over again what a privilege it is to be a husband and a father. I am a true believer in the English proverb “Children are a poor man’s riches.”</p>
<p>Let me share a few experiences:</p>
<p>But children are good for more than just entertainment. I learned the value of praying for one’s enemies from my seven-year-old son Matthew. His prayer just after having been scolded by me went like this: "I'm thankful for my sisters, and I'm thankful for my brother, and I'm thankful for my mom. And please help me to love my dad even though he is driving me nuts!"&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important Lessons</strong></p>
<p>There are some things I learned as a husband and father that I am not sure I could have learned any other way.</p>
<p>When our daughter Adrian was four years old, we were working in the backyard. I had asked her to do something three or four times without result. I lost my patience, raised my voice, and sternly repeated my instructions to her. With her head down, she sadly started in the direction of the house. Suddenly, she stopped, ran back, hugged my leg tightly, and said, “Even though you are being mean to me, I still love you.”</p>
<p>I suddenly understood with great clarity what the Savior meant when he said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as&nbsp;little&nbsp;children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Agents that Act and Not Objects to be Acted upon</strong></p>
<p>When our daughter Erin was in junior high, a hugely popular movie swept the country. It went on to win several major awards, and everyone was talking about it - including my daughter’s friends. Of course, Erin wanted to see the movie and begged to be allowed. I was aware of some inappropriate content and didn’t think it was a good idea. While struggling with this issue, I felt inspired to leave the decision to her. This was NOT something I was used to as a parent. She was our oldest, and so far, things had gone pretty well with the parents making all of the decisions!</p>
<p>We sat down at the computer together and read several reviews which described what kind of violence, sexuality, nudity, and profanity the movie contained. At first, she was defensive because she thought I was simply trying to pile on facts in order to further my side of the argument, but then I told her it would be her decision. She was as shocked as she was elated.</p>
<p>A few days later, she came to me and said, “Dad, I wish you had just told me ‘yes’ or ‘no’ about the movie. Now that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> decision, it’s a lot harder.”</p>
<p>To her credit, Erin eventually decided not to see the movie. We both learned valuable lessons from this experience. I learned just why agency is so important to our Heavenly Father’s plan. My daughter learned that once we take responsibility for our choices, everything is different. Once we realize that we are “<strong>agents that act</strong> and not objects to be acted upon,” the game changes.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;Taking responsibility for our choices is a monumental step in spiritual maturity.</p>
<p><strong>Vicarious Suffering</strong></p>
<p>Not long ago, one of my daughters came home from a date. I heard the garage door open, the car pull in, and the garage door close, but strangely, I could still hear the car running. Since I know this can be dangerous, I went to the garage to investigate. When I opened the car door, I found my daughter hunched over the steering wheel sobbing. She had just experienced a heart-wrenching break up with someone she cared deeply about. It was so hard for me to see this. I wanted to crawl into the car, take her into my arms, and just hold her. But somehow, I instinctively knew that she needed to be alone for a time. I turned off the car, quietly closed the door, and went inside. As I sat in the living room agonizing from a distance, the thought came to me that I was then experiencing, to a small degree, what the Father must have felt as he watched His perfect Son suffer when He withdrew His spirit. It was a meaningful lesson for me and one I doubt I could have learned with as much power and clarity in any other way.</p>
<p><strong>The Family is Ordained of God</strong></p>
<p>Because of my experiences as a husband and father, I have come to appreciate what a genius Heavenly Father is. He allows us to not only be born into families and experience them as children but to create families ourselves and to experience them as parents. There is so much we can learn from our experiences as children, as spouses, and as parents!</p>
<p>Elder Bruce C. Hafen taught, “Marrying and raising children can yield <strong>the</strong> <strong>most valuable religious experiences</strong> of [our] lives.”<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I admit, it is scary to get married and to be responsible for children. It takes a tremendous amount of faith and courage. It requires commitment and maturity and patience and unselfishness and a whole list of other virtues, and frankly, most of us are not completely ready for it when it comes. But marriage and children provide a broader bandwidth of experiences than being single can ever provide. Because there are more people we love involved in a family, we become a lot more vulnerable. The highs are higher and the lows are lower.</p>
<p>Most of you are probably familiar with the American comedian Jim Gaffigan. He lives in New York with his wife and five children between the ages of ten and two. In a recent interview, he made the following observations<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>:</p>
<p>By starting a family, you have the ability to design and create an eternal learning lab. No matter how wonderful or how dysfunctional the family you grew up in was, as an “agent that acts,” you can create whatever kind of family and home environment you choose. If you are already married and are wondering where all of the happiness is, be an “agent that acts” and fix it! Figure out what needs to be changed and start changing it! If you are single and are not having the success you are seeking, be an “agent that acts” and change something. Read more so you can become more interesting. Exercise more if that is needed. Join a service organization to stretch yourself and meet more people. Don’t passively wait to “fall” in love. Be proactive and purposeful!</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>You are what you do;<br />You do what you choose;<br />If you don’t like what you are,<br />Then change what you do.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>I realize that not everyone has the opportunity to have a spouse and children. There are many who are single or childless whose hearts long for these experiences. As Sister Jennifer Lane taught us in her University Convocation address last week,<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;“While [Heavenly Father] doesn’t cause everything to happen, He can consecrate everything that does happen for our gain.”<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;I have great faith in Heavenly Father’s ability and willingness to compensate for these faithful souls in other miraculous and loving ways. But for those who are able to marry and have children, but are unwilling, or fearful, or selfish, there are great blessings being forfeited.</p>
<p>Whether you are in your own eternal family now or still “creating it spiritually,” it is important to know that the first, and most important factor in having a happy marriage is for God to be a part of it.</p>
<p><em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</em> makes it very clear:</p>
<p>“Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that none of these principles are exclusive to only those who are married. We can all practice the principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, and so on. Clearly, our success in marriage and family has as much to do with our relationship with God as it does our relationship with our spouse and children.&nbsp; A successful marriage, then, has more to do with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">becoming</span> the right one than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finding</span> the right one.</p>
<p><strong>A Triangle</strong></p>
<p>In a worldwide leadership training meeting, Elder David A. Bednar introduced a model for describing a covenant marriage. Imagine a triangle with the Savior at the apex and a man and a woman at each of the other two corners. Notice what happens to their relationship as they both “come unto Christ.”<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>At first glance, this may seem a little counter-intuitive. If someone wants to strengthen a relationship, shouldn’t they focus on their partner and those interactions rather than on a third party? Most often, the answer to that question is “yes,” but it is not “yes” if that third party is the Son of God. Bringing the Savior and His atoning power into a relationship magnifies everything good in it and allows what is not so good to be overcome and changed.</p>
<p>Let’s think about why Elder Bednar’s model works.</p>
<p>First, someone who is honestly working to become more like Christ is already accustomed to change. They accept that they have weaknesses and are humbly and steadily trying to improve. Would you rather be married to someone who is humble and willing to make positive changes or someone who is content with where they are and is only happy if everyone and everything else adapts to their needs and desires?</p>
<p>Second, the more Christ-like a person is, the easier they are to love. Who could not be compatible with someone who is as patient, loving, and unselfish as the Savior? Living with someone who is making an effort to become Christ-like will make a big difference in how happy you are. You don’t have to find the perfect person – just find someone who has perfection as their goal and is actively working to get there.</p>
<p>Finally, it is much easier to be “equally yoked together” with someone who is striving for the same goals that you are. While two people do not necessarily have to be alike in personality, hobbies, and personal preferences to have a happy marriage, it is much more difficult if their goals are not compatible.</p>
<p>In summary, for those already married, the triangle teaches us the key to a happy and successful marriage. For those still single, the triangle teaches that the best way to successfully marry is to become and to find someone who puts God first. While I do not believe in the fairy tale ending of “living happily ever after,” I testify that it is very possible to live “happily <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even</span> after” – by putting God first in our lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we probably all know some very good people who were married in the temple but who are now divorced. From the outside looking in, everything seemed to be right, and yet the marriage failed. Does that mean Elder Bednar’s model doesn’t really work?</p>
<p>The truth is there are a large number of reasons why marriages fail, and we have no right to judge whether they should or should not have, but one element of marriage that is hard to ignore is making a poor choice in the first place. While it is not impossible to overcome a poor choice with the principles we have discussed so far from the <em>Family Proclamation</em> and Elder Bednar, it is obviously harder than if a better choice had been made in the first place.</p>
<p>So how do we go about making the right choice?</p>
<p><strong>Making a “Right Choice”</strong></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that in most cases, I do not believe God will tell you whom to marry. It happens but is very rare. Because God values agency, He allows us to use our judgment to select the person we want to be with for eternity. &nbsp;He may send warning signals if we are about to make a poor choice, but in the end, He allows each of us to choose our eternal companion and then work to MAKE a celestial marriage with them. We can take comfort in this promise from President Boyd K. Packer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“It is not expected that you go through life without making mistakes, but you will not make a major mistake <em>without first being warned</em> by the promptings of the Spirit. This promise applies to all members of the Church.”<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>May I suggest one area where I believe young single adults are making a critical judgment error when it comes to selecting a mate?</p>
<p>Think for a minute about how couples typically get together. I have always been fond of this poem. (For those of you from warmer climates, this has to do with ice skating on a frozen pond):</p>
<p>Slippery ice, very thin;<br />Pretty girl, tumbles in.<br />Saw a fellow on the bank;<br />Gave a shriek, then she sank.<br />Boy on land, heard her shout.<br />Jumped right in, and pulled her out.<br />Now he’s her’s; very nice.<br />But first, she had to break the ice.<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>The Three Pillars of a Relationship</strong></p>
<p>What I am about to share is not a rigorously tested theory but rather simply some of my observations based a few prophetic principles. I think there are at least three pillars of a relationship we should be paying attention to. The first is physical. This is the reason most couples get close enough to one another to get together in the first place. I don’t think I need to spend much time explaining this one – especially to this group!</p>
<p>The second pillar is emotional. This pillar has to do with maturity level, intellect, interests, goals, hobbies, and personality. It involves questions like “Can you carry on a meaningful conversation? Do you share similar goals and aspirations? How do you feel about money and how it should be used? Can you communicate effectively? If you were not attracted to one another physically, would you still be friends?”</p>
<p>The third pillar is spiritual. This pillar is about faith, testimony, and commitment.&nbsp; This isn’t so much about <em>what</em> you know about the gospel but how you apply what you know. Do you put God and His kingdom first in your life? Are you faithful in your church responsibilities? How important is church attendance and temple worship? This pillar deals with application issues such as “Do you attend church meetings while you are on vacation? Is it okay to watch sporting events or movies on Sunday? Is it important to show up when it is your turn to clean the chapel?” In short, how compatible are you when it comes to applying gospel principles?</p>
<p>The problem with most relationships is that pillar number one can, and often does, grow much faster than the other two pillars. While the physical pillar can launch into orbit at breathtaking speeds, the other two take time. They cannot be rushed. As a result, pillar one can grow so quickly that the other two barely have a chance to get started before pillar one hits “the Mormon glass ceiling.” This is the point in the relationship where a couple starts brushing up against the limits of the Law of Chastity. There is still more pillar, but that progress is only supposed to be made by married couples.</p>
<p>There are only four options when this happens:<br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to hover just under the glass ceiling long enough to see what the other two pillars are going to look like.<br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get married.<br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End the relationship.<br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violate the Law of Chastity.</p>
<p>Let’s look at each of these.</p>
<p><strong>Option One: Hovering</strong></p>
<p>There are at least two problems with this choice. First, it is extremely difficult to hover. As Lowell Bennion observed,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Kissing is more stimulating than satisfying; consequently, it invites more and more. Once a couple begins to share affection in a physical way, this activity tends to become the focus of interest. Often such a couple ceases to explore the other significant dimensions of personality: mind, character, maturity, religious faith, moral values, and goals.”<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, our bodies have been created by a wise Heavenly Father. God, in his wisdom, put powerful chemicals in our bodies to help shape our behavior. For example, women have a chemical called oxytocin that is released while breastfeeding that helps them to bond with their newborn child.<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;(Oxytocin is sometimes called the “bonding chemical” or the “feel good chemical.”) Curiously, that same chemical is released in both men and women when they hug, kiss, or experience pleasant physical touch.<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;Think of that! Heavenly Father provides a means for couples to actually grow closer to one another through physical contact. This is great news for spouses, but do you see the problem with bringing these bonding chemicals into play before you are a couple?</p>
<p>These “feel good chemicals” sometimes make us feel so good that they cloud our judgment about what we are truly seeing in a person’s behavior. We intentionally overlook or rationalize “red flag” behavior or character traits we might otherwise avoid. I am sure most of you know at least one person who has been in a bad relationship, the kind where everyone but the person in it can see it is a disaster? Those are usually the chemicals talking. Trust me. You do not want to make an oxytocin-induced decision that will affect you and your posterity for eternity!</p>
<p><strong>Option Two: Get Married!</strong></p>
<p>This works, if you are lucky. It could happen that after you are married, you will find that the person you were so physically attracted to also happens to have most of the other qualities you had hoped to find in a spouse. You may find that they think like you, have the same value system, are engaging and interesting to talk to, and have all of the other qualities you wanted in your eternal companion. But divorce statistics, even within the Church, indicate that there may be too many couples who take this option only to find that once they are married, they really aren’t all that compatible in pillars two and three. A person is then left to make the most of a bad situation (for eternity!) or worse – to end the marriage. The latter almost always comes at great personal heartache and pain; both to the couple and to the many other family members and friends involved.</p>
<p><strong>Option Three: End the Relationship</strong></p>
<p>This works from the standpoint of avoiding the dangers of “hovering” or making a poor marriage choice, but it also may mean that you are pushing off someone that may have been a great marriage choice had you taken the time to fully investigate pillars two and three. While this is a safer choice, it is also a poor long-term strategy. If you have to end every relationship prematurely, you should not expect to get married for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>Option Four: Violate the Law of Chastity</strong></p>
<p>There has been ample written and said about the consequences of this choice, and many devotional and conference talks have addressed this topic. I will refer you to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President and Sister Wheelwright’s Devotional address given at the beginning of Winter Semester (2014).</span> May I just say that this is obviously the least desirable of the four choices because the physical, emotional, and spiritual consequences are so dire.</p>
<p>So what is the best option?</p>
<p>The best option is to avoid the glass ceiling altogether. By suppressing the growth of the physical pillar, the other two pillars – emotional and spiritual – have time to develop. That is the purpose of dating – to explore these two pillars. Suppressing pillar one allows you to patiently investigate pillars two and three with a clear head and to discover what these two pillars truly look like before making a decision that lasts for eternity.</p>
<p>Some of you are thinking right now “Are you seriously telling us not to kiss and cuddle with anyone until we are pretty sure we are serious about marriage?” Yes, I am. Why would you want to risk bonding with someone until you are sure you want to be bonded? That seems pretty logical.</p>
<p>It is not that kissing and cuddling are evil, but they have their proper time and place. When kissing is done as a tender expression of true affection between two people who are committed to one another, there is a chance it is being done out of love. Between two people who are still trying to decide whether they are committed to one another – it is lust. Motive matters!</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball taught,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Kissing has been prostituted and has degenerated to develop and express lust instead of affection, honor, and admiration. To kiss in casual dating is asking for trouble. What do kisses mean when given out like pretzels and robbed of sacredness?”<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Just remember friends first, lovers later.</p>
<p>Some mistakenly think that the only purpose for this kind of counsel is to keep them away from the danger zones of unmarried physical intimacy. They think that as long as they can stay in control, they can “hover” around the glass ceiling and not be harmed. But this behavior ignores the effect of the bonding chemicals on their decision making ability and the negative effect it has on their spiritual capacity to hear and heed the warnings about which President Packer promised. There is much more to it than just avoiding serious moral transgression.</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott declared,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Satan tempts one to believe that there are allowable levels of physical contact between consenting individuals who seek the powerful stimulation of emotions they produce, and if kept within bounds, no harm will result. As a witness of Jesus Christ, I testify that is absolutely false.”<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>He goes on to say,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“When you are mature enough to plan seriously for marriage, keep your expressions of feelings to those that are comfortable in the presence of your parents.”<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The truth is true love cannot be found in pillar one until it has already been found in abundance in pillars two and three. The best way to find true, committed, eternal love, is to search diligently in pillars two and three. Remember what the prophet Alma taught his son Shiblon?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Bridle all your passions that ye may be filled with love.”<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In the context of the three pillars – physical, emotional, and spiritual - I would like you to reconsider this paragraph from <em>the For the Strength of Youth</em> pamphlet. It is hopefully very familiar to you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“When you are sexually pure, you prepare yourself to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple. You prepare yourself to <strong>build a strong</strong> <strong>marriage</strong> and to bring children into the world as part of an eternal and loving family. You protect yourself from the <strong>spiritual and emotional damage</strong> that come from sharing sexual intimacy outside of marriage. Remaining sexually pure helps you to be confident and truly happy and <strong>improves your ability to make good decisions </strong>now and in the future.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, these are promises made to you by prophets, seers, and revelators!</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball once said that “right marriage begins with right dating.” Are you willing to pay the price to have a happy, healthy marriage that lasts forever? It may cost you a little thrill and self-gratification on the front end, but you will make a much better marriage choice and will have much more happiness in this world and in the world to come. It is the law of the harvest: if we want a greater blessing, we have to live a higher law.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I want to mention one other experience. Laurie said that I love being a grandfather, and that’s absolutely true. We just got back from a two-year stint at the Church Office Building at the Commissioner of Church Education office, and right after we relocated to Utah, our oldest daughter had her first child, which is our first grandchild. We were in the hospital, and after the baby was born, we were invited in. I had just finished four years as a young single adult ward bishop, so I had had a fair amount of experience with the issue that you might expect would come across the desk of a YSA ward bishop. As I walked into the room and saw my daughter and her husband holding this new baby, so fresh from our Heavenly Father’s presence in this perfect little body, ready to start her eternal journey here on the earth, the Spirit whispered to me, “This is why the Law of Chastity.”</p>
<p>It was a powerful experience for me. It’s so wonderful to watch two loving parents take a child and make efforts to teach them about the Gospel, the Savior, and Heavenly Father’s plan for them. Evie, our granddaughter, just turned two last week, and Erin told us that they were talking in Family Home Evening about the Savior. Evie stopped what she was doing for a moment and said, “Jesus. I like that guy.”</p>
<p>It’s wonderful to see you brothers and sisters making faithful decisions to have children and teach them the proper way so that they can return to their Heavenly Father. You will be so blessed, I promise, by making these sacrifices.</p>
<p>Be an agent that acts. If you don’t like where you are, change the things you do.</p>
<p>Married or single, follow the formula for successful families: “faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (including correct media choices).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right marriage begins with right dating.</p>
<p>If you want a greater blessing, live a higher law.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p class="Body">Let’s travel back to the year AD 65, the city of Rome. The Apostle Paul<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;knew he was about to die,<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;and as he wrote his last letter to his protégé Timothy, he was in a reflective mood. Chained to a Roman soldier,<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;I imagine he looked back on what he had accomplished and what he had endured: whipped almost to death five times; beaten within an inch of his life three times; stoned and left for dead once; shipwrecked three times; betrayed by false brethren; left hungry, cold, and naked; all the while worrying about keeping the encroaching apostasy at bay<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>—his list of trials goes on and on.</p>
<p class="Body">But I also imagine he thought about his triumphs. Ever since his miraculous conversion on the road to Damascus, he had transformed himself from a tentmaker to a worldwide missionary, spreading the good news of Christ. As he prepared for his death, he undoubtedly thought of the eternal friends he had made, the souls he had helped to save, and his unfailing faith in doing the Lord's will.</p>
<p class="Body">“I have fought a good fight,” he wrote to Timothy. “I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.”<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">I don't think Paul chose this analogy carelessly. Its meaning and application to our lives, 2,000 years later, is a remarkable manifestation of the power of the scriptures and how we can apply them in our lives. I hope, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, to help us all understand a little bit better what Paul was trying to tell Timothy—and us.</p>
<p class="Body">To do that, I invite you on a metaphorical run with me during the next half hour. To begin, let me help us prepare for our run by giving this scripture some context. I love the Apostle Paul, and I've always admired his courage and conviction. We know quite a bit about him because he wrote much of the New Testament.</p>
<p class="Body">Though most of the Savior's apostles were simple “men of Galilee,”<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;Paul was born in Tarsus, a large trading town renowned for its university. He was a Roman citizen as well as a Jew<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>, which gave him a higher social standing than most Hebrews. He was trained a Pharisee and was taught by a famous rabbi<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;in classical literature, philosophy, and ethics. He could speak several languages. In short, Paul was a pretty cosmopolitan guy for his time.<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">I’m convinced Paul was a sports fan.<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;He lived in an area where there were lots of sporting events, and he often drew on these slices of everyday life to teach eternal principles—much like our Church leaders using the Olympics as examples in their sermons.<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">Each of those verses is a sermon in itself, but your shoes are laced up and you’re ready to go. As the starting gun goes off, let’s explore a little more the verse to Timothy I started with: “I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course.”<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Fought the Good Fight</strong></p>
<p class="Body">For the first lap, let’s explore what Paul meant when he said he fought a good fight. There are three elements to fighting good fights I’d like to focus on:</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Choose Our Battles</em></p>
<p class="Body">We all know people who seem ready to rumble at any moment. In Pidgin, we hear, “Ho, brah — you like scrap?”<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;But not every fight is worth fighting. The Book of Mormon provides a couple of examples.</p>
<p class="Body">I marvel at the people of Ammon. After turning from their murderous, wicked ways, they buried their weapons and covenanted to never fight again. Even with the invading army bearing down upon them, they were committed to not fight.</p>
<p class="Body">“Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war.”<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">The people of Ammon chose wisely not to fight.</p>
<p class="Body">Later in the book of Alma, we see when it is appropriate to choose to fight. The Lamanites were so mad that the people of Ammon wouldn’t fight them that they decided to go fight the Nephites instead. Captain Moroni and other righteous warriors “were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all.”<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">These examples teach us that we should follow the Spirit to know when to fight. Let’s choose our battles wisely. If our roommate hasn’t cleaned her side of the room, is that really worth fighting about? If someone gives us stink-eye, or cuts us off on the road, or disparages our second cousin, is that worth fighting for? Maybe sometimes it is, but we should always listen to the promptings of the Spirit first and make sure our motives are as pure as the people of Ammon, or the Nephites when their very way of life was threatened, before we decide to put up our dukes.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body"><em>Never Surrender</em></p>
<p class="Body">Let’s look at a historical example to illustrate this concept.<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">In the early days of World War II, England watched anxiously as Europe fell to the Nazi war machine. Winston Churchill gave three remarkable speeches to convince his country that this was a fight worth fighting for. Certain phrases from these speeches have become quite famous:</p>
<p class="Body">“I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. … [W]hat is our aim? …Victory.”<a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">“[W]e shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender[!]”<a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">“If we can stand up to [Hitler], … men will still say, This was their finest hour.”<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">Sometimes, we might be afraid to fight. We might be tired, or without hope, or resigned to let evil prevail. When we feel this way, let’s remember Churchill’s stirring words. When the fight is worth fighting for, let us aim for victory, let us never surrender, and let it be our finest hour.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Be Good Sports</em><a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">Fighting a good fight also includes fairness, ethics, and respect.<a href="#22"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;A good fight usually has good sports on both sides, but we should always be good no matter what our opponents do.</p>
<p class="Body">Let’s ask ourselves, “Would we rather be a Mike Tyson, with a taste for ears,<a href="#23"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;or a gentleman boxer who follows the rules?”</p>
<p class="Body">I think Heavenly Father cares more about our character during athletic contests than he cares about the outcome.<a href="#24"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;In our daily battles, let’s remember to be good sports. President Monson has called good sportsmanship “a goal beyond victory.”<a href="#25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">So, let’s choose our battles by listening to the Spirit and examining our motives. When we choose to fight, let us never give up. And let’s be good sports about it.<a href="#26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>I Have Finished My Course</strong></p>
<p class="Body">We’ve finished the first lap—fighting good fights—so let’s turn, now, to the second part of Paul’s declaration—“I have finished my course.” Some Bible translations render this “I have finished the race.”<a href="#27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">I’m one of those weird people who love to run. Running for me is an outlet. I joke that running keeps me from beating my kids. You can probably tell how high my stress level is by the distance I run. If you see me on the road by Turtle Bay, I’m doing fine. If I’m past Haleiwa, I’m working through some stuff. It’s my thinking time—time for me to meditate and work through problems.</p>
<p class="Body">For me, running is also an exercise in self-control, similar to fasting. When we fast, we are putting our spiritual needs over our physical needs. When I run, it’s mind over matter. My brain and my heart tell my body, “We’re going to survive this, so quit whining.” Paul describes it better than I: “But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection.”<a href="#28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">Let’s spend this lap of our run together sharing a smattering of lessons learned and personal applications that might help you as you run your own races.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Seek the Prize</em></p>
<p class="Body">Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.”<a href="#29"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;In modern language, we might translate that to say, “Run to win!”</p>
<p class="Body">What kind of prize is Paul talking about? Many races have different kinds of prizes.<a href="#30"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;The top prize for the Boston marathon is $150,000. The Jamba Juice Banana Man Chase winners get free smoothies for a year.<a href="#31"><sup>31</sup></a>&nbsp;My kids like doing that race, not because they expect to win but because they get a free smoothie at the finish.<a href="#32"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp;Some races have a finisher’s medal or T-shirt. That’s the kind of prize Paul wants us to seek—prizes for finishing. In the race of life, the crown of righteousness is like a finisher’s medal; there is no grand prize. In Ecclesiastes, we read, “The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.”<a href="#33"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;It’s an endurance race.</p>
<p class="Body">Elder Holland tells us, “We are not in a race against each other to see who is the wealthiest or the most talented or the most beautiful or even the most blessed. The race we are <em>really</em> in is the race against sin.”<a href="#34"><sup>34</sup></a>&nbsp;That’s the kind of race where anyone who tries hard enough, and endures to the end, will get a prize.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Coaching</em></p>
<p class="Body">I’ve been coaching Cross Country here since 2010, and it’s a marvelous experience. We have amazing student-athletes who do amazing things, and it’s a privilege for me to be a small part of their lives. When I started coaching, I had no real idea what to do. There’s some technique to running, and some minimal equipment, but it’s not like I had to teach the runners set plays or go over each player’s position. Often, my coaching came down to this: “Well, try running faster.”</p>
<p class="Body">But as I’ve learned more about coaching—through much trial and error, and also by watching and listening to Coach K<a href="#35"><sup>35</sup></a>—I’ve realized that coaching is helping people see what they can’t see themselves. A coach gives guidance and direction. A coach is there to share in the glory and agonize with you in defeat.</p>
<p class="Body">When runners want to come to BYU–Hawaii, they fill out a questionnaire so I can get to know them better. One of the questions is “How coachable are you?” If they aren’t coachable, which means willing to listen and do what I suggest, then I know it’s going to be a bit harder for them to fit in. Our team needs athletes who are willing to listen, who are willing to change, and who are willing to admit that coaches can see things athletes can’t see themselves.</p>
<p class="Body">Our head coach in this race of life should be the Holy Spirit.<a href="#36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">When we take the Holy Spirit as our guide,<a href="#37"><sup>37</sup></a>&nbsp;or coach, we will be warned of upcoming obstacles. The Holy Ghost can point out our weaknesses and help us fine-tune our spiritual stride. He can whisper encouraging words of hope no matter how down we are. As we prove worthy to receive his promptings, we will be motivated to try running faster. As we swallow our pride and become more coachable, the Spirit will whisper God’s will to us, making us better than we could ever be ourselves.</p>
<p class="Body">Sometimes, we also might need the help of assistant coaches, or spiritual athletic trainers. Our bishop and other church leaders can help us when we’re spiritually injured. Our family and friends can help us persevere. Let’s not try to run our life’s race without any coaching. Let’s be coachable, so we can be better.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>The Importance of Training</em></p>
<p class="Body">Training is an essential part of our race.<a href="#38"><sup>38</sup></a>&nbsp;Once we’re at the starting line, “the time for preparation is past.”<a href="#39"><sup>39</sup></a>&nbsp;Getting the miles in each week, finding the race in every workout, and breaking our muscles down to build them back up are all principles of training. King Benjamin gave an excellent training strategy in his speech on the tower: “See that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he have strength. … He should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize.”<a href="#40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">We don’t just train our bodies, though. There’s a Hawaiian principle called Lokahi, which means balance or harmony.<a href="#41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">For Cross Country, we use Lokahi as a triangle to remind us that we need to be in balance with our mind—school work, positive attitudes; our body—training, nutrition, and rest; and our spirit—keeping ourselves spiritually healthy. When any one of those things is out of balance, it affects the other areas, and we aren’t training the best we can.</p>
<p class="Body">As we train, we measure performance<a href="#42"><sup>42</sup></a>&nbsp;to track progress. If something unexpected happens—injury, sickness, a new-found love—we adjust our training. It’s important, when we train, to keep the end goal in mind and not get so focused on the immediate. Elder Marvin J. Ashton said, “The direction in which we are moving is more important than where we are at the moment.”<a href="#43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">The same principles apply to our training for everyday races. We have to prepare—mind, body, spirit—and have harmony in our lives. Sometimes we have to face the same temptation over and over again. When we do, we’re training ourselves to have self-mastery. The obstacles we’re given in life make us stronger. We need to measure our performance, so we can tell we’re improving but remember to not get caught up in where we are at the moment—keep the end in mind. All that training during our daily races helps us to be prepared, ready, and in excellent condition for the race to win our crowns of glory.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Confidence</em><a href="#44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">I ran the Wasatch Back Ragnar in 2012. A Ragnar race is a relay that covers about 200 miles or so. Teams of 12 runners are assigned segments of the course and hand off the baton to the next runner. It’s basically two days of driving through some beautiful country, hopping out of the van to run like mad, then doing it again and again while you try to occasionally eat and sleep.</p>
<p class="Body">My second leg was an 8-mile uphill jaunt up to East Canyon reservoir.<a href="#45"><sup>45</sup></a>&nbsp;I started a bit hesitant because I wasn’t sure what to expect, and I hadn’t had time to adjust to the altitude. Then, a thought came to my mind: “Kevin, you live the Word of Wisdom. You’re promised that you can run and not be weary, and walk and not faint.” That thought filled my body with energy and determination, and I flew up that mountain! I felt such joy and happiness that I couldn’t help offering encouragement to all the runners I passed (much to their chagrin) and reveling in the beauty of the world around me and the miracle that our bodies are.</p>
<p class="Body">When we have confidence that we’re doing what is right, our Heavenly Father will help us in our races. He won’t take the mountains away, but he will help us get up them. He’s promised us that when we do His will and follow His coaching, we’ll be strong. With each covenant we make with God, He promises us so many wonderful blessings, and we should be confident in our abilities to live up to our eternal potential.</p>
<p class="Body">“But they that wait upon the Lord,” Isaiah wrote long ago, “shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Follow the Rules</em></p>
<p class="Body">Paul didn’t tell Timothy, “I ran a great fun run!” Rather, he said he finished his course, which implies structure, rules, boundaries, and following instructions.</p>
<p class="Body">Each racecourse has its own rules. I’ve been in races where it’s fine to help another runner out. I’ve been in others where assisting another runner would disqualify both of us. Some races are timed to the minute and some to the hundredths of a second. One awesome race I was in had the finish line at the bottom of a children’s playground slide.</p>
<p class="Body">Just like different races have different rules, we have different rules at different times in our lives. Some rules are constant—like the commandments and doctrines of the Kingdom—but some rules apply to a specific situation. I believe what matters most is the integrity we have within us to live the rules of the current race we’ve been given, and that’s how we’ll be judged.</p>
<p class="Body">One of the rules of this BYU–Hawaii race we’re running is the Honor Code. Each of us, whether student or employee, has committed to live by the Honor Code and Dress and Grooming standards. Those are the rules that are in place for this race right now.</p>
<p class="Body">I must admit when I first got to BYU, I was surprised to hear students complain about the Honor Code and Dress and Grooming standards. To me, it was part of the package of being there. I had my agency to decide whether to go to that school or not. If I wanted to wear shorts above the knee, or drink, or smoke, or pierce my ear, I had the choice to go elsewhere. Once I decided to attend that school, I also decided to live by its rules. It wasn’t a question of whether bearded men go to the Celestial Kingdom but rather a question of Honor—my honor.</p>
<p class="Body">I once ran in a Warrior Dash. A Warrior Dash is a 5k race with all kinds of obstacles mixed in—climbing ropes, wading through water, jumping over fire, and sliding through mud.</p>
<p class="Body">It was a lot of fun. In my heat, I was in the front with another guy when we got to the first obstacle—a 4-inch balance beam on an incline. I was a bit surprised when he ran around the beam while I teetered my way across. I felt a bit of vindication, though, when a course marshal told the guy he had to go back and do the obstacles.</p>
<p class="Body">“I have to do all the obstacles?” the guy asked, somewhat incredulously. “I just want to run!”<a href="#46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">So, when I hear of people complain about how restrictive the Honor Code is, or I see people openly rebelling against the Dress and Grooming standards, I think of that guy at the Warrior Dash who was upset he wasn’t able to make his own rules.</p>
<p class="Body">Paul uses another sports analogy to remind Timothy of this concept: “And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.”<a href="#47"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;We only get the prize if we follow the rules of the contest.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Good Directions</em></p>
<p class="Body">Another part of following a course is getting good directions and following them. There’s a fun race called the Mango Madness,<a href="#48"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;a challenging 10-mile course in the mountains, and part of the fun is people get lost every year, sometimes running quite a few more miles than they should.</p>
<p class="Body">The first time I ran the Mango Madness, I was nervous because I didn’t know the course at all. I listened very carefully to the instructions before the race, so I would know what to do. Unfortunately, the instructions were something like this: “OK, head out toward the top, then go through Ginger Gate. Take the second left, that’s different from last year, and then go around the banyan tree the other way because the trail got washed out a bit. OK. Go!”</p>
<p class="Body">I was lost before we even started. I wondered, “Is Ginger Gate made out of ginger, or is it manned by a red-headed volunteer?” Now, luckily, I’m hardly ever first in races, so it was easy to follow someone, and I tucked in right behind a guy running about my same pace. It soon became apparent that guy didn’t know where he was going either. He turned left when I was pretty sure we were supposed to turn right, so we grinned at each other and parted ways, each secretly wishing the other would get lost so we could move up in the final results.</p>
<p class="Body">I felt confident I had chosen wisely until I came down a steep hill to a T in the road. I had no idea where to turn. There was no one around—just me and the mango trees. I tried looking for footprints, marking ribbons, anything but was absolutely flummoxed. I stood there for two minutes, trying to figure out what to do, watching precious seconds tick by, when I finally heard someone way up the hill shout, “To the right!” As I looked back, I saw that from where he was, he could see where the road went. He also looked very confident, so trusting that he knew the course, I turned right and raced on ahead.</p>
<p class="Body">That experience helped me to realize how important it is to get clear instructions, follow them, and hope for the best.</p>
<p class="Body">How does that apply to you? Well, we get instructions in life through the scriptures, church leaders, teachers, coaches, family, and friends. Sometimes, when we’re following someone who is starting to stray, we need to make the tough decision to let friendships go and turn back to the main path. Occasionally, someone higher on the hill, who knows the course and can see where to go, will give us helpful directions if we trust their experience and insight.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Making Marathons Harder</em></p>
<p class="Body">Not too many people have run a marathon—in the United States, it’s about .5% of the population.<a href="#49"><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;I ran my first marathon in college and checked it off my bucket list. But after we moved to Hawaii, and I started eating too many loco-mocos,<a href="#50"><sup>50</sup></a>&nbsp;I decided I needed to run another one. Ever since then, I’ve been hooked.</p>
<p class="Body">As hard as a marathon is, some people have purposely made it harder. There are all kinds of weird records for marathons. For example:</p>
<p class="Body">The record for tallest costume worn in a marathon was set by someone dressed as a 23-foot tall giraffe. There are records for fastest marathon while juggling, while running backwards,<a href="#51"><sup>51</sup></a>&nbsp;and juggling while running backwards.<a href="#52"><sup>52</sup></a>&nbsp;A guy from Missouri knitted a 12-foot scarf while running a marathon, wearing sunglasses so he wouldn’t poke his eyes out if he fell.<a href="#53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">One of my favorites is Tony the Fridge Man who runs marathons with a 92-pound mini fridge strapped to his back. He does it to raise funds and awareness for cancer research and has accomplished all kinds of amazing feats.<a href="#54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">As entertaining as those records are, or as noble as it is to draw attention to cancer research, I believe there’s a lesson to be learned. As we run our race, we often make it harder than we should.</p>
<p class="Body">My dear friends, I implore you, with all the love and sincerity I can muster, to shed the weight of sin you might be carrying around with you during your race. None of us is perfect, and we all have improvements to make. But some sins weigh upon us more heavily. If you pray each night asking for blessings, but you know deep down you’re trying to hide something from the Lord, you’re carrying around a mini fridge. If you are uncomfortable when you feel the Spirit because every time you do, you remember something you need to repent of, you’re carrying around a mini fridge. If you say to yourself, “I’ll confess later,” you’re actually saying, “I’ll carry this mini fridge around some more.” If you say to yourself, “What I did wasn’t really that bad,” you’re just denying how much that fridge really weighs. I promise you, I <em>promise</em> you, that if you make the decision today to start the steps of repentance, you will feel as if a mini fridge has been taken off your back. As you confess to your bishop, as hard or as embarrassing as it might be, you will come to realize how much easier it is to run your race without extra baggage. Most amazingly, you will find that our Heavenly Father can now use you to run faster or even help others with their own self-imposed burdens. If you’re carrying around a mini fridge, I challenge you to drop it—today.</p>
<p class="Body">Paul sums up this idea perfectly, in his letter to the Hebrews: “Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”<a href="#55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body"><em>Joy in the Journey</em></p>
<p class="Body">A while back, I woke up one morning with the plan to run to Walmart. I was getting ready for a distance race, and when I developed my training plan about a month earlier, it was easy to put that on the calendar. But as I walked out the door at 3:30 AM, I wasn’t too happy about my ambitious plan the month before. I was tired. I hadn’t eaten exactly right the night before. My favorite running shirt was in the wash. I knew it was going to rain. I was in a bad mood. As I grumbled and stretched, thinking of just going back to bed, my coach whispered in his still small voice, “Find the joy in the journey.”<sup><a href="#56">56</a>&nbsp;</sup>The change was almost instantaneous. I looked up at the sky with its millions of stars. I felt the cool breeze on my cheek. I remembered, once again, how lucky I am to live in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="Body">That day was an awesome run. It rained hard about one mile into it, and instead of grumbling about the potential chafing, I thanked God for keeping it cool. As the sun touched the clouds at Mile 8, I was thankful for the miracle of every sunrise and the beauty of God’s creations. I marveled at the power of the North Shore waves. I was grateful for the sweet smell of the pineapple fields. I reveled at another chance to prove to my body that I could control it and run up that final hill in Mililani even though my calf muscles wanted to give up and lie at the side of the road. My run was full of precious spiritual experiences and promptings, which I will never forget. And I could have missed all that because of my attitude.</p>
<p class="Body">Ever since that day, I make it a point, as much as I can, to smile when I run. I probably look very foolish, and sometimes it’s a forced smile, but I remember how important attitude is.</p>
<p class="Body">Sometimes for Cross Country workouts we go for a fun run in the mud, or the jungle, or have horses chase us. We make it fun.</p>
<p class="Body">As we go through our races, let’s always remember to find the joy in the journey. As midterms approach, take a minute to smell a flower. If you break up with someone who’s not quite “the one,” reflect on the good times and look forward to meeting more people. Count your blessings. Smile through the pain. President Uchtdorf told us this past General Conference, “There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter, more joyful, even glorious. We can be grateful!”<a href="#57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body"><em>Aid Stations</em></p>
<p class="Body">There is nothing as joyous as a well-stocked aid station when you really need one. I’ve seen all kinds of aid stations—some just have a gallon of water hidden in a bush or one kid lazily pointing the way to turn. Some have so much good food and drink you’re tempted to stop and graze for a while. The point is many courses have help along the way, especially at points where runners need it most. Aid stations are carefully planned out by course directors to provide direction, point out pitfalls, and replenish energy. As we run our races, let’s not ignore the aid stations around us.</p>
<p class="Body">Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin said, “You young people also have ‘aid stations’ to help you keep moving along your course. They should include your parents, other family members, ward leaders, and teachers who have ‘run more races’ and are farther along the path of life. Benefit from the experience they have accumulated.”<a href="#58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">We’re surrounded by spiritual aid stations. We have daily aid stations of scripture study and prayer. We have the weekly aid station of the Sacrament where we’re spiritually fed a reminder of the covenants we’ve made. We have an eternally significant aid station just up the hill in the temple, where we can rest from the worries of our race, remind ourselves of the straitness of the path, and fortify ourselves against whatever trials might lay ahead.</p>
<p class="Body">Perhaps now and then we also have the opportunity to be someone else’s aid station. As we pay attention to the runners around us, we might, now and then, share a word of encouragement or, more importantly, provide some spiritual nourishment to a fellow runner struggling along. President Monson said, “You and I do not run alone. That vast audience of family, friends, and leaders will cheer our courage, will applaud our determination as we rise from our stumblings and pursue our goal.”<a href="#59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">The Run to the Sun on Maui<a href="#60"><sup>60</sup></a>&nbsp;had great aid stations, and I was grateful for each one of them. Each station had positive people and delectable food—the one at Mile 29 had whole baked potatoes!</p>
<p class="Body">The best part of that race, though, was that, starting at Mile 26, my eternal companion was at every aid station. She’d wait for me to come through, give me a word or two of encouragement, flash a beautiful smile, and then drive ahead to the next one and wait for me. But it’s not just at races. My wife is my everyday aid station. Through the longest day or the darkest night, I’m blessed to have her there, to help me and to forgive me, always encouraging me to be better, run my best, and endure to the end. If you haven’t yet found your eternal companion, I encourage you to think about the person who will have the qualities you’ll need at your own personal aid station. If you are married, I encourage you to consistently think of what your spouse might need at his or her aid station and be the best support you can.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Falter or Finish</em></p>
<p class="Body">There comes a point in every race where we have to decide what to do. Do I give in to the pain, or do I gut it out? We talk about that often in Cross Country practice. Many of our workouts are for what I call “Pain Management 101.” We practice experiencing pain and conditioning our hearts and minds to tell our body to continue on. Then, when we’re in a race, and faced with the question to push through or quit, we’ve been conditioned to know what to do.</p>
<p class="Body">So it is with life. President Monson said, “The difficulties which come to us present us with the real test of our ability to endure. A fundamental question remains to be answered by each of us: Shall I falter, or shall I finish?”<a href="#61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">One Saturday morning, I hit the road bright and early, and I felt great. I had 20 miles scheduled on my training calendar, but it was such a beautiful day, and I was feeling so great, I decided to stretch it to 26. When I turned around at Waimea Bay to head home, I realized part of my feeling great was I had had a nice tailwind the whole way out. I knew I’d have to fight the wind all the way back. I soon found out that feeling fine at Mile 9 doesn’t mean you’ll feel so keen at Mile 14.</p>
<p class="Body">The rest of the run was a disaster.<a href="#62"><sup>62</sup></a>&nbsp;I hadn’t eaten right the day before, so I didn’t have much in the tank. It rained on me, and I was chafing. It was hot and windy. I kept my eyes down on the road, hoping to find enough change for bus fare, so I could catch a ride home. I shuffled along, stopping for a drink whenever I could, until I finally made it home.</p>
<p class="Body">That day helped me later in a race. When I came to the moment of decision—to falter? or to finish—I thought back to how I felt, scanning the road for bus money, and how I had survived. “If I survived that day,” I said to myself, “I can push through the pain to finish this race.”</p>
<p class="Body">Let’s each of us learn from our past pains and decide today to endure to the end.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>Embrace Failure</em></p>
<p class="Body">I know some runners who don’t want to enter a race unless they know they’ll win it. I’m not that kind of runner—first of all, I’m not fast enough but also some of my greatest lessons have come when I’ve failed.</p>
<p class="Body">There’s a Japanese proverb: 猿も木から落ちる(Saru mo ki kara ochiru), which means “Even monkeys fall from trees.”<a href="#63"><sup>63</sup></a>&nbsp;No matter how good we are at something, we can’t be perfect all the time. Don’t be afraid to get back up, dust yourself off, and get right back into it. A poem called “The Race” by D.H. Groberg<a href="#64"><sup>64</sup></a>&nbsp;tells the story of a young boy who falls down three times during a race. Each time he falls, he wants to give up—his dreams of victory shattered—yet as he thinks of facing his father at the finish line, who’s been such an encouragement to him, he gets back up.</p>
<p class="Body">Three times he'd fallen, stumbling;<br />Three times he rose again;<br />Too far behind to hope to win<br />He still ran to the end.</p>
<p class="Body">They cheered the winning runner<br />As he crossed the line first place.<br />Head high, and proud, and happy;<br />No falling, no disgrace.</p>
<p class="Body">But when the fallen youngster<br />Crossed the line last place,<br />The crowd gave him the greater cheer,<br />For finishing the race.</p>
<p class="Body">And even though he came in last<br />With head bowed low, unproud,<br />You would have thought he'd won the race<br />To listen to the crowd.</p>
<p class="Body">And to his dad he sadly said,<br />"I didn't do too well."<br />"To me, you won," his father said.<br />"You rose each time you fell.”</p>
<p class="Body">When we want to give up, hopefully we can think of our Heavenly Father anxiously waiting for us to get back on our feet and continue our race, so He can meet us at our finish line and give us our prize.</p>
<p class="Heading"><strong>Final Lap</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Let’s start the final lap of our run together today as I share two more examples that bring this all together.</p>
<p class="Body">This experience about fighting the good fight and finishing the race is tender to me. A couple of years after we moved to Hawaii, I got a new best friend — Lausi’i Tafua, Jr. The Tafua family was in our ward, and I had worked with Junior in the Young Men’s program. One day, out of the blue, I got a call from his wife Diane. She explained that the TV show “Wheel of Fortune” would soon be filming in Honolulu for what was called “Best Friends Week.” Instead of one person spinning the wheel and guessing the phrases, teams of best friends would be competing. Diane said she wanted Junior to be on the show, and Junior said he’d only do it if they could think of someone who would be good at the game, so she asked if I would be Junior’s best friend and audition for the show.</p>
<p class="Body">We didn’t make it past the second tryout round, but over the years our families have joked about our “bestie” relationship. Shortly after that TV tryout, Junior found out he had cancer. Over the next several months, he fought a horrible fight, riding the knife’s edge of killing the cancer without killing his body. Through perseverance and faith, with loving support from family and friends, he completed that course, with the cancer going into remission.</p>
<p class="Body">Fast forward several years, and in 2012 Junior faced another fight. The cancer was back. With a daughter Nalia leaving soon on a mission, another daughter Maila headed for college, and his only son Mika just a couple of years away from receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood, Junior was faced with another decision. Should he choose to fight again? The prognosis, even with radiation and chemotherapy, wasn’t promising, but Diane and his family wanted him to persevere.</p>
<p class="Body">As the months passed, though, Diane saw what Junior was going through—his pain and suffering, his strong body wasting away from the battle. She struggled with her feelings—she hated seeing her eternal companion in such agony, but weren’t her desires righteous? Adding to the stress of taking care of her husband and her family, Diane wondered whether this was a fight worth fighting.</p>
<p class="Body">Ultimately, through some very special experiences, Diane came to know that Junior’s fight should come to an end. Once she received that confirmation, both she and Junior felt the peace that comes from submitting to the Lord’s will, even though it’s not the course we might have designed for ourselves.&nbsp; On February 10, 2014, Junior’s fight was over, and he finished his course. Free from the pain of his mortal experience, I believe he now watches over his family while they run their own races—part of an unseen support team we often take for granted.</p>
<p class="Body">As he approached the end, I had a good final visit with Junior. We laughed once more about almost being famous TV buddies and other precious moments. But I also remember his looking straight into my eyes and saying, “I’m at peace. I’m ready to go home. I want to see you in Heaven when it’s your turn, so you’d better be good.” Junior’s example and his admonition has had a profound impact on my life. I decided I needed to run my own race a little better because I want to be with him, my best friend, when my course is finished.</p>
<p class="Body"><em>The Ultimate Example</em></p>
<p class="Body">Let me finish with the ultimate example of fighting the good fight and finishing a course—our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="Body">He knew when to pick His battles.<a href="#65"><sup>65</sup></a>&nbsp;I think of the Savior's gentle rebuke to Peter when the guards of the chief priests came to arrest Him on that night of infamy. “Put up the sword,” He told Peter. “The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?”<a href="#66"><sup>66</sup></a>&nbsp;Instead, His healing touch proved yet again that He was sent from God. Jesus knew it wasn't time to fight. A greater battle—much more powerful and personal—lay ahead.</p>
<p class="Body">Besides showing us when to fight the good fight, the Savior of the world, our elder brother, the Messiah, showed us how to finish our course. That final sorrowful night, He was given a race to run that we cannot even fathom. He had offered to run this race in the pre-mortal life.<a href="#67"><sup>67</sup></a>&nbsp;He had lived a perfect life of preparation. But, little by little, this race was getting harder.</p>
<p class="Body">First, His support team crumbled. As His soul became exceedingly sorrowful, His Apostles were filled with doubt, fear, and slumber.<a href="#68"><sup>68</sup></a>&nbsp;When He was arrested, they fled.<a href="#69"><sup>69</sup></a>&nbsp;His chief apostle betrayed Him three times.<a href="#70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">As the weight of the world—my sins and your sins—descended upon Him, He pled with the Father for some way out. In His words, “[This] suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.”<a href="#71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">We know what the Savior did. “[N]evertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<a href="#72"><sup>72</sup></a>&nbsp;“[A]nd I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.”<a href="#73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">There was one more great and somewhat unexpected trial that awaited Him, however. As He was reaching for the finish line, anxious to be done and return to His glory, His greatest support, His constant companion, the Holy Spirit—our coach—withdrew from Him. I believe it was His greatest test yet, and it was the hardest to overcome. Jesus cried out in anguish, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”<a href="#74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">In spite of that last, great obstacle, Jesus pressed on. Elder Holland says it well: “Finally and mercifully, it was ‘finished.’ Against all odds and with none to help or uphold Him, Jesus […] could say in triumph, ‘Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.’”<a href="#75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p class="Body">The Savior finished the greatest race ever run.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Brothers and sisters, as we sprint to the finish today, I’m grateful that Paul was inspired to write his trials and testimony and encourage us to fight good fights and finish our courses. I'm grateful for righteous men—often martyrs—who kept his words alive throughout the Dark Ages, so we can learn from him in our day.<a href="#76"><sup>76</sup></a>&nbsp;I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who has specifically designed my life to give me the challenges and joys I need most, so I can live up to my eternal potential, and He has done the same for you. I am grateful for the coaching of the Holy Spirit to help me run with patience the race that is set before me. And, ultimately, I am grateful for the Master, our Savior Jesus Christ, who fought the good fight on our behalf, who finished His course—even though He didn't want to—so we can repent of our sins, cast off our mini fridges, be forgiven, and at the judgment bar of our Eternal Father have our elder brother be our advocate to plead on our behalf. If we are worthy and if we have endured to the end, we will receive our own crown of righteousness and live forever with Paul in the glories of eternity. That each of us will finish our course and gain that glory is my hope and prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith described Paul: “He is about five feet high; very dark hair; dark complexion; dark skin; large Roman nose; sharp face; small black eyes, penetrating as eternity; round shoulders; a whining voice, except when elevated, and then it almost resembled the roaring of a lion.” Quoted from <em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 180. However, an August 1999 <em>Ensign</em> article ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/08/paul-untiring-witness-of-christ?lang=eng#footnote3-99908_000_006" target="_blank">Paul: Untiring Witness of Christ</a>") posits that perhaps he was citing an apocryphal source. There is <em>T<a href="http://archive.org/stream/jstor-3136819/3136819_djvu.txt" target="_blank">he Acts of Paul and Thecla</a></em>, a text from ~ AD 150 that describes Paul. However, Joseph Smith recounted how “divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time” visited him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">D&amp;C 128:21</a>), so perhaps the Prophet spoke from personal experience.<br /><a name="2"></a>2. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">2 Timothy 4:5</a>.<br /><a name="3"></a>3. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/27.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Acts 27:1</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/28.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Acts 28:16</a>. The Augustan Regiment describes the Praetorian Guard, which over time became much more than just the emperor's bodyguards, becoming the “first office of the empire.” (Edward Gibbon, <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, Vol. I, p. 159.)<br /><a name="4"></a>4. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/11.23-28?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>.<br /><a name="5"></a>5. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">2 Timothy 4:7</a>.<br /><a name="6"></a>6. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/1.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">Acts 1:11</a>.<br /><a name="7"></a>7. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/22.25-28?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">Acts 22:25-28</a><br /><a name="8"></a>8.

"The Early Life and Background of Paul the Apostle."&nbsp;<em>The American Journal of Biblical Theology</em>. We can see this not only through his writings, but also in his knowledge of the current events and issues of his day. He felt comfortable in almost any setting, and often used contemporary events to teach the early Saints. His speech in Athens about the Greeks’ unknown god (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/17.16-34?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Acts 17:16-34</a>) is a wonderful example about building on common beliefs. But he was always true to his convictions and testimony, and never wavered in proclaiming what’s right. To me, Paul was a good example of being in the world but not of it (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.14-18?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">John 17:14-18</a>).<br /><a name="10"></a>10. Fascinating side note: a movement came into vogue during the Victorian era called “Muscular Christianity,” based largely on Paul’s teachings. It’s a commitment to piety and physical health. Read more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_Christianity" target="_blank">here</a>. Paul was mostly familiar with the Isthmian Games, similar to the Olympics. Athletes from all over Greece would gather near the city of Corinth every other Spring for these Games. Though it was dedicated to Poseidon, Paul saw that he could draw parallels from this slice of everyday life to teach the early Saints. It's believed that Paul was in Corinth during the games of AD 51. We imagine, since he was a tentmaker, that he went there not only to preach the gospel but to earn a living selling tents to all the tourists (This idea came from <em>The Apostle Paul and the Isthmian Games. Biblical Archaeologist&nbsp; 25/1: 2-31, 1962a.)</em>. <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmian_games" target="_blank">The Isthmian Games </a>had contests in chariot races, wrestling, foot races, boxing, and music and poetic contests. I love the story that perhaps Nero himself participated in the singing contests in AD 66, (forcing the Olympics to be moved a year), and even though his voice was awful, he ended up winning (see <a href="http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol7no2/dahm.html" target="_blank">http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol7no2/dahm.html</a>). Perhaps Paul heard about that farce, and part of his letter to Timothy emphasized that he finished his course with faith and integrity, and deserved the prize. It’s interesting to note that these were all individual contests. Other areas of the world had team sports, but not so much in the Mediterranean. If Paul had been in China, perhaps his analogy would use the game <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuju" target="_blank">cuju</a>, or <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468128/polo" target="_blank">polo</a> in Persia, or a <a href="http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/726643" target="_blank">pokatok court</a> in ancient Mayan times. (An interesting note on Pokatok. Over the summer of 2014, our family went on a long road trip, which included spending time listening to audio books. One of the audio books was <em>The 39 Clues: Unstoppable Book 3: Countdown</em>, which included scenes from Guatemala. The book's characters spent a lot of time discussing Pokatok, and it became kind of a family joke. That's one of the reasons I listed it here.) But I think Paul liked the individuality of these contests, because he knew that each of us must work out our own salvation individually. Exaltation is not based on a team score.<br /><a name="11"></a>11. Gary E.

It might seem strange to talk about finishing our course the third week of the semester, when our courses still seem so new. Let me briefly share an experience of mine that some of you might find helpful.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My first college exam was for my Economics 110 course. I had taken Economics in high school, and knew the laws of supply and demand. I figured I didn’t need to study—what else was there to know? As I settled in to my chair in the Testing Center, though, and read the first question, I felt the first tremors of foreboding. I skipped to the next question, thinking perhaps the professor had put the hardest one first just to scare us. But it wasn’t to be. As I glanced through page after page, graph after graph, I knew I was sunk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25 percent. That’s the score of my first college test. But to make things worse, I made another mistake. I figured with a score that bad, I was too deep in the hole, too far gone. So, as much as I’m ashamed to admit it now, I just quit going to class.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m still embarrassed by that tough lesson, even though it happened before most of you were born. The story does have a happy ending, though. After my mission, when I had learned a few things about life and about myself—and economics—I retook that class and got an A. I finally finished that course.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I digress, because that’s not the kind of course Paul was talking about finishing.<br /><a name="13"></a>13.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Markdlacrz/status/236690631186075648">https://twitter.com/Markdlacrz/status/236690631186075648</a> is just one example of many.<br /><a name="14"></a>14. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Alma 24:6</a>.

How can we protect ourselves and our loved ones from those that see opportunity in knowing that we can be pushed without being easily provoked? These questions can be resolved by a glorious aspect of gifts of the Spirit. These gifts are only received <em>and exercised</em> under the influence of the Holy Ghost.” I recommend the whole talk.<br /><a name="15"></a>15. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.45?lang=eng#44" target="_blank">Alma 43:45</a>.<br /><a name="16"></a>16.

How about this story of sportsmanship? In February, 2009, the Milwaukee Madison high school basketball team was playing against DeKalb, Illinois. Johntel Franklin missed the start of the game because his mom had died of cancer that very afternoon. He showed up late and entered the game, but because his name wasn't listed in the official scorebook, the team was assessed a technical foul. The other team’s coach asked the referees to forfeit the free throws, but was forced to send someone to the line to take the two shots anyway. Senior Darius McNeal went to the line, and despite a 2-point game, missed both shots badly—on purpose. After the game, Johntel said, “It's love. That's all it was that day was love.”“In Which Missed Free Throws Are the Game's Biggest Shots,” from Bleacher Report, Feb. 9, 2014.

I’ve often thought about whether Heavenly Father cares about sports. I remember praying mightily in 1978 for the Denver Broncos, my favorite NFL team, to beat the Dallas Cowboys. I was devastated that my prayers weren’t answered, but it was a good lesson for a 7-year-old. My prayers weren’t answered for a long time, until, on the fifth try, the Broncos finally won a Super Bowl.<br /><a name="25"></a>25. President Monson spoke in the October 1988 General Conference, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1988/10/goal-beyond-victory" target="_blank">Goal Beyond Victory</a>.” There are several great stories about his days playing sports, and an admonition about keeping Church ball clean.<br /><a name="26"></a>26.

There are countless different training programs, but they all have similar elements: physiology, or the mechanics of your body; running; and recovery, which allows muscles to heal and get stronger.

A great example of confidence comes from the Legend of Cliff Young. In 1983, Cliff Young signed up for the inaugural “Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon,” a multi-day race of 544 miles (875 kilometers). Cliff was a 61-year-old potato farmer in overalls and gum boots, and the race organizers were afraid for his safety. He assured them, however, that he had spent many years running over the countryside rounding up sheep, and he would be fine. The race started, and the other runners laughed at Cliff’s slow, steady shuffle as they left him far behind. At the end of the first day, when all the other runners were getting ready for bed, Cliff finally shuffled up. Imagine their surprise when he shuffled right past them—he wasn’t planning to sleep, but to do the whole race without stopping. Cliff won that race by 10 hours. Because of Cliff, the “Young shuffle” is now used by many ultra marathoners, and they all run through the night. Cliff’s confidence has rubbed off on others, and our confidence often can do the same thing—help people reach new heights, shatter records, or just finish.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great tortoise and the hare story. Also interesting to note the race goes from the Westfield Parramatta shopping center in Sydney to the Westfield Doncaster in Melbourne—a nice piece of marketing (<a href="http://www.elitefeet.com/the-legend-of-cliff-young" target="_blank">http://www.elitefeet.com/the-legend-of-cliff-young</a>).<br /><a name="45"></a>45.

I was amazed at two things: first, that the guy thought he could be proud of his finishing time without going through all those obstacles, and second, that he even signed up for the Warrior Dash if he just wanted to run. I mean, the waiver for the race was like 20 pages long! There were lots of other races—cheaper and cleaner—he could have entered if he just wanted to run.<br /><a name="47"></a>47. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/2.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">2 Timothy 2:5</a>.

For distance running, it’s important to train your body how to survive glycogen debt. Without getting into the details, on a long run your body has to switch from the sugars in your stomach to the sugars stored in your liver. If you’re not used to that, your body feels like you’re hitting a wall—thus the phrase. It takes a while for a body to get used to that, but you can condition yourself to have a smoother transition. It takes continual effort, and you have to do it several times for your body to get used to it. And the preparation is key. If you don’t prepare right, the results can be a bummer. Here’s a simple explanation of how glycogen is used in exercise: <a href="http://www.answers.com/Q/How_is_glycogen_used_during_exercise" target="_blank">http://www.answers.com/Q/How_is_glycogen_used_during_exercise</a>.<br /><a name="63"></a>63.

After his 40-day fast, Satan came tempting him, trying to engage him in a battle of wits and power. The Savior, our Redeemer, wisely did not take the bait, and chose not to engage in the Devil's increasingly desperate attempts. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.1-11?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Matthew 4:1-11</a>. A fine article in the January 2013 <em>Ensign</em> by Michael Barber entitled "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2013/01/helping-youth-become-powerful-learners-and-teachers?lang=eng" target="_blank">Helping Youth Become Powerful Learners and Teachers</a>" posits that the Savior knew the scriptures so well he could deflect any temptation the adversary offered, and how the same kind of spiritual preparation and scripture knowledge help the youth in our day. But he didn't shy away when the time was right for battle. The 23<sup>rd</sup> chapter of Matthew contains some of the Savior's strongest words as he rebukes the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocritical actions. Calling them hypocrites seven times in just a few verses—as well as serpents and a generation of vipers—he asks how they expect to escape damnation because of their unrighteous acts. It's not often that we find an exclamation point in the scriptures, so I pay attention when I see one. This chapter is full of them, and I think of how the Savior must have sounded. According to <a href="http://www.chacha.com/question/how-many-verses-in-the-christian-bible-have-exclamation-points-in-them" target="_blank">this survey</a>, there are 313 exclamation points in the KJV Bible!

Elder Holland explains why, in this race, it was essential for Jesus to finish completely alone. “It was required, indeed it was central to the significance of the Atonement, that this perfect Son who had never spoken ill nor done wrong nor touched an unclean thing had to know how the rest of humankind—us, all of us—would feel when we did commit such sins. For His Atonement to be infinite and eternal, He had to feel what it was like to die not only physically but spiritually, to sense what it was like to have the divine Spirit withdraw, leaving one feeling totally, abjectly, hopelessly alone.” Jeffery R.

<p>September 16, 2014<br />Steven C. Wheelwright<br />President, BYU-Hawaii <br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning and aloha! We hope that this new semester is off to a wonderful start for all of you. For those of you who are new to BYU–Hawaii, we wish you a special welcome and are grateful for all that you have done to prepare and qualify for this wonderful learning experience.</p>
<p>Here at one of the Lord's universities, we have the great blessing of a front-row seat and a unique role in His work rolling forth. At BYU–Hawaii, we are blessed to learn and grow in an environment where the gospel of Jesus Christ sets the tone and invites the Spirit in all that takes place. We also have the guidance and counsel of the Church and its educational system supported by faithful tithe payers. Additionally, we are blessed with a community of faithful saints and a temple in our midst.</p>
<p>In light of these amazing blessings, we acknowledge that “unto whom much is given much is required.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Over the past couple of years, those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators have been teaching us about "the hastening of the Lord's work." In doing so, the focus has often been on missionary work, but we are all invited to be a part of this hastening in an even broader scope. Not only are we to proclaim the gospel, but we are also to perfect the saints and redeem the dead. Still, it is useful to remember that we are not being asked to engage in a new program; we are simply being asked to be truly devoted disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>The Story of Noah and the Flood</strong></p>
<p>One of the wonderful examples of such discipleship that has always fascinated me is that of the prophet Noah, who we know through modern-day revelation to be the heavenly messenger Gabriel. Noah was a man of great courage and faith, undoubtedly and truly devoted to the Lord. In describing the time during which Noah lived, the book of Genesis records:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of [man’s] heart was only evil continually. ... And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Noah had completed the ark and filled it as directed by God, those who were righteous–Noah and three of his sons and their wives–entered the ark. They and all the living things on the ark were preserved as God proceeded to fulfill His promised destruction of the wicked through a flood that covered the whole earth.</p>
<p>Afterwards, God promised Noah that He would never again&nbsp;<em>destroy&nbsp;</em>the earth with a flood; sadly, we know from both ancient and modern prophets, not to mention our own experiences, that wickedness is again filling the earth. But in our day, the Lord is not literally flooding the earth with water to destroy the wicked. Rather, He is figuratively flooding the earth with truth to save the righteous. Listen to these prophetic verses from the book of Moses. Speaking to Enoch, the Lord says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“And the day shall come that the earth shall rest, but before that day the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth; and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be among the children of men, but my people will I preserve;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“And righteousness will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten;...and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood.”<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I would like to focus my remarks on how the Lord is carrying out His promise to flood the earth with truth and the implications of that for each of us. As a backdrop for that discussion, let me start by highlighting three fundamental aspects of the Lord’s plan for His children.</p>
<p><strong>Three Fundamentals of the Lord's Plan</strong></p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God’s work is the work of salvation</span></em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more simply stated than by the Lord, Himself, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Moses 1:39</a>: “For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”</p>
<p>God's work includes the creation of this world as a place for our mortal probation. Here, we can gain a physical body and learn and grow and prove ourselves; we can make mistakes, repent, and try again. This is a place where we can use the talents and gifts He has endowed us with to refine and pursue the desires of our hearts. Of course, central to His work is the gift of His Son, His Atonement, and His gospel, which provides us the way to accomplish these things. Jesus Christ is "the way, the truth, and the light," and "no man cometh unto the Father but by [Him]."<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I like the way that Elder Russell M. Nelson recently summarized the components of this Work. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This important work includes member missionary work, convert retention, activation of less-active members, temple and family history work, and teaching the gospel. Too often, we think these aspects of the gospel are unrelated. But these efforts are not separate, they're all part of the work of salvation."<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The Lord invites us to be a part of His work–the work of salvation–for ourselves and for those around us. This was true in the pre-mortal realm, it will be true throughout the eternities, and it is certainly true here and now.</p>
<p>Second,&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">learning is the pathway to truth</span></em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that the “glory of God is intelligence or, in other words, light and truth,”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;and the Lord Himself has commanded that we “seek learning, even by study and also by faith.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, we know that any “knowledge and intelligence [gained] in this life through … diligence and obedience … [will be to our] advantage in the world to come.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Smith taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“[Learning the] truth, combined with proper regard for it, and its faithful observance, constitutes true education. The mere stuffing of the mind with a knowledge of facts is not education. The mind must not only possess a knowledge of truth, but the soul must revere it, cherish it, love it as a priceless gem; and this human life must be guided and shaped by it in order to fulfill its destiny.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this, Elder Oaks has added:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Our quest for truth should be as broad as our life’s activities and as deep as our circumstances permit. A learned Latter-day Saint should seek to understand the important religious, physical, social, and political problems of the day. The more knowledge we have of heavenly laws and earthly things, the greater influence we can exert for good on those around us, and the safer we will be from scurrilous and evil influences that may confuse and destroy us.”<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>What a blessing it is to know that our learning is so central to God’s plan for His children and of such profound value to us both here and in the eternities. No wonder the Church and our leaders are so committed to assisting us with our education, not just on this campus but wherever we might be and in whatever circumstances we might find ourselves.</p>
<p>Third,&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">revelation is the source of all truth</span></em>.</p>
<p>As stated in the 9th Article of Faith, "We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God." Our church is a church of continuous revelation.</p>
<p>In 1862, speaking about revelation as the source of all truth, the prophet Brigham Young said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Every discovery in science and art that is really true and useful to mankind has been given by direct revelation from God, though but few acknowledge it. It has been given with a view to prepare the way for the ultimate triumph of truth, and the redemption of the earth from the power of sin and Satan. We should take advantage of all these great discoveries, the accumulated wisdom of ages, and give to our children the benefit of every branch of useful knowledge, to prepare them to step forward and efficiently do their part in the great work [of salvation]."<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>We have the blessing of living in the dispensation of the fullness of times–a time when all things are being revealed. In the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord taught Joseph Smith that “God will give unto you knowledge by His Holy Spirit…that has not been revealed since the world was until now."</p>
<p>He then added, “Nothing shall be withheld. … All … shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fullness of times.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The Lord further expanded this thought in section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants: “Those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of this great promise, we can be confident that the Lord is guiding the discovery and implementation of new knowledge and truth, whether it be in the field of medicine, engineering, economics, or social science. He is both able and willing to reveal&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>things for the purpose of furthering His work and building His kingdom. It is certainly a blessing to be at one of His universities at this unique and special time, when the Lord is hastening this work.</p>
<p><strong>The Hastening of His Work</strong></p>
<p>One way the Lord is hastening His work of salvation is by guiding inspired men and women in their learning as He reveals additional truth at an ever increasing rate.</p>
<p>In my wife’s introduction, she mentioned some of the wonderful inventions that have impacted our lives. Each of these were based on what the world refers to broadly as&nbsp;<em>technology</em>. In the academic world, technology is defined as a body of knowledge that enables us to do something we could not do prior to the discovery, refinement, and application of that combined knowledge.</p>
<p>During much of my career, the focus of my academic work was on the development, refinement, and application of such technologies. Allow me to share a handful of illustrative examples of how revealed technology has played and continues to play a key role as the Lord floods the earth with truth.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Written Word</span></p>
<p>The first example involves the development of the printed word. For centuries, copies of letters and manuscripts were made by hand primarily by monks. Then, in 1436, the Lord guided and inspired Johannes Gutenberg in the development of a new technology: the printing press and movable type. The first printing press could only print a single sheet of paper at a time and had with moveable type arranged and “set” by hand. The type would then be coated with ink, and as many pages as desired could be printed. Then the type would be broken down and sorted, and a new set of pages would be arranged and set, and the process repeated.</p>
<p>Though somewhat slow and cumbersome, almost immediately this new technology was used to convert handwritten manuscripts into printed pamphlets or tracks and even full books. With books more widely available, growing numbers of people desired to learn to read. All of this was prelude to the Lord causing His word–as found in the Bible–to sweep the earth as with a flood.</p>
<p>By the mid-1500s, brave men like Martin Luther and William Tyndale were using the technology of moveable type and the printing press to publish the Bible, making it available to tens of thousands of lay people. Previously the Bible had been read only by clergy (who possessed handwritten manuscripts and could read the original language in which it had been written). But now, with the printing of the Bible in common languages plus increased literacy rates, the word of God quickly became available to the lay person. This fueled the Reformation and the great opportunity for commoners to use their agency and faith in deciding for themselves what to believe.</p>
<p>Then in the early 1600s, King James of England sought to develop a standard version of the Bible that he hoped would quell the fighting among the various Protestant churches. The result was published in 1611 as the King James Bible, and it rapidly became widely available. The technology developed by Gutenberg, and refined by those who followed, helped accelerate the demand for religious freedom by flooding the world with the truth of God’s word. And, by 1820, these and other developments paved the way for a 14-year-old farm boy to read James 1:5 and follow its counsel by asking God for wisdom.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exploration</span></p>
<p>The second example involves the tremendous exploration, discovery, and mapping of the earth that gained momentum in the late 1400s with the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World. Using the knowledge of ships, currents, winds, and navigation that others before him had developed, Columbus added the courage and faith required to make his epic voyage. While others had previously sailed the known world following a route from Northern Europe and the Mediterranean around the tip of Africa and traveling to India and the Far East, they rarely ventured more than a few days from the known land masses.</p>
<p>Until this time, the Lord had chosen to keep the Americas hidden from the view of the rest of the world. By 1492, He had prepared Columbus and his small band of comrades, spread between three ships, to make a discovery that would provide a place where freedom of religion could take hold and flourish. Indeed, Columbus said of his divine mission:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The Lord purposed that there should be something clearly miraculous in this matter of the voyage to the Indies. … I spent seven years [in Spain] in [the] royal court discussing this subject with the leading persons in all the learned arts, and their conclusion was that all was in vain. That was the end, and they gave it up. But afterwards it all turned out just as our Redeemer Jesus Christ had said, and as He had spoken earlier by the mouth of His holy prophets."<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>While others may have given up, Columbus did not. He could not. As he recorded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“With a hand that could be felt, the Lord opened my mind to the fact that it would be possible to sail, and He opened my will to desire to accomplish the project. … This was the fire that burned within me. … Who can doubt that this fire was not merely mine, but also of the Holy Spirit … urging me to press forward.”<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Columbus’ own account of his first voyage quickly became a bestseller throughout Europe, selling out three printings in its first year. This account, combined with the maps and charts developed and refined by other explorers who soon began to sail to the New World, resulted in the development of trade routes between North and South America and Europe. Within a century of Columbus’ discovery, growing numbers of Protestants seeking religious freedom were moving to the New World, establishing communities where they could worship freely, according to the dictates of their conscience.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Industrial Revolution</span></p>
<p>As a third example, I cite the Industrial Revolution and, more particularly, the technology of the mechanization of work. As President David O. McKay learned as a young man preaching the gospel in his native Scotland, it is very difficult to share the gospel with someone who must work sunup to sundown just to feed their family. With the development of textile machines that could produce thread and weave cloth, the productivity of the individual worker began to increase rapidly. The modern factory was born. Mill towns began to spring up, and people left the countryside, moving to cities where work was plentiful.</p>
<p>The productivity gains that came from the mechanization of labor resulted in improved living conditions and increased leisure time. Such mechanization spread to farming in the late 1800s, resulting in a smaller and smaller labor force being needed for the production of food. Even today, the refinement of such technology has continued to raise productivity, the standard of living, and the availability of leisure time.</p>
<p>As more and more of the world’s population enjoys better living conditions and more discretionary time, they are able to take advantage of greater opportunities for education and learning. Industrialization continues to provide God’s children with increased opportunities to use their agency, to find and study the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to serve others.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transportation</span></p>
<p>A fourth example of technology hastening the work of salvation is seen in transportation. For thousands of years, travel over land was constrained by the speed of the horse and over water by the speed of sailing ships. That quickly changed as the Industrial Revolution spread from textiles to farming to finally transportation. Initially, the machines used in mills were driven by water power, such as that generated by a water wheel. But with the spread of factories, there came an increased need for more reliable and versatile sources of power. The first of those new power sources was the steam engine. Railroads and ships quickly adopted that new technology to speed travel, and the era of modern transportation had begun.</p>
<p>By 1869, with the completion of the transcontinental railroad, those joining the church and moving to Zion could travel by steamship and train rather than by wagon and handcart. Similarly, missionaries could travel to their fields of labor more quickly and safely.</p>
<p>Those improvements in transportation have continued up to the present time, further helping to flood the earth with truth by enabling the Lord's messengers and special witnesses to travel the globe, ministering to His sons and daughters. Such advances in transportation have been essential to the operation of His church on a worldwide basis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communication</span></p>
<p>Let me share one final example, perhaps the most rapidly changing of them all–that of advances in communication. While the development of the printing press and movable type was a great leap forward in written communication, additional technologies such as the radio, telephone, television, and satellite communications came forth in the twentieth century. These have been of great use to the Church in reaching the growing membership throughout the world. But prophets have understood that these changes were only the beginning. As then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley declared in 1981:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We are confident that as the work of the Lord expands, He will inspire men to develop the means whereby the membership of the Church, wherever they may be, can be counseled in an intimate and personal way by His chosen prophet. Communication is the sinew that binds the Church as one great family. Between those facilities which are now available&nbsp;<em>and those which are on the horizon</em>, we shall be able to converse one with another according to the needs and circumstances of the time.”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Today, we have the additional blessings of communication via internet and wireless technologies. Like the other technologies I've mentioned, these too are advances that the Lord has revealed to assist in causing righteousness and truth to sweep the earth as with a flood.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to conclude by asking this question: What does the Lord expect of each of us as we pursue the inspired purposes that have brought us to BYU–Hawaii? To answer, let's return to the three fundamentals with which I began.</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God’s work is the work of salvation</span></em>.</p>
<p>Because this is one of His universities, under the direction of the First Presidency and the CES Board, He expects each of us to&nbsp;<em>develop a strong and growing testimony of His work</em>. He expects and desires that our spiritual learning keep pace with our ever-expanding academic learning. As stated by then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley to a group of students here on this campus some years ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Each day we are made increasingly aware of the fact that life is more than science and mathematics, more than history and literature. There is a need for another education, without which the substance of our secular learning may lead only to our destruction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I refer to the education of the heart, of the conscience, of the character of the spirit—these indefinable aspects of our personalities which determine so certainly what we are and what we do in our relationships one with another.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>I invite you to assess regularly the progress of your own spiritual learning and testimony and to strengthen your spiritual education by personally becoming involved and fully enlisted in the hastening of His work. As you do so, you will be assisting the Lord in flooding the earth with truth. Indeed, the inspired vision of the prophets who have visited this campus is one of you returning to your home area and continuing to help as the Lord builds His kingdom.</p>
<p>Second,<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;learning is the pathway to truth</span></em>.</p>
<p>In a wonderful talk entitled “<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1992/11/where-is-wisdom?lang=eng" target="_blank">Where is Wisdom?</a>” (General Conference, Nov. 1992), Elder Russell M. Nelson said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Because of our sacred regard for each human intellect, we consider the obtaining of an education to be a religious responsibility. Yet opportunities and abilities differ. I believe that in the pursuit of education,<em>&nbsp;individual desire is more influential than institution, and personal faith more forceful than faculty</em>.”</p>
<p>Education is not something that is beneficial only for some, and learning is not something that applies only during certain seasons of our lives. The Lord intends for us to gain knowledge throughout our mortal probation. If we limit our own learning and preparation, either spiritually or temporally, we will not be able to do all that we might have done, either now or in the future.</p>
<p>President Eyring expanded on this important principle when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The Lord knows both what He will need you to do and what you will need to know. He is kind and He is all-knowing. So you can with confidence expect that He has prepared opportunities for you to learn in preparation for the service you will give. You will not recognize those opportunities perfectly...but when you put the spiritual things first in your life, you will be blessed to feel directed toward certain learning, and you will be motivated to work harder.”<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>I would invite each of you to set a standard for all you do here at BYU–Hawaii that is consistent with such learning being a part of His work and a part of your eternal destiny. Begin today to develop the habits of learning by study and&nbsp;<em>also by faith</em>. This will become a foundation for learning throughout your life. These habits will be invaluable to you in your career and in your family life.</p>
<p>Third,&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">revelation is the source of all truth</span></em>.</p>
<p>Given the pace of discovery of new knowledge and its application, none of us expect that the technologies so prevalent in our lives today will remain unchanged a decade from now. But it’s easy to lose sight of the real purposes of those technologies: To bless the lives of His children&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>assist in flooding the earth with truth.</p>
<p>When the Lord talks about putting His kingdom first, He’s talking about&nbsp;<em>not losing sight of His purposes and not becoming distracted by worldly things</em>. We need to understand, value, and apply new technologies for righteous pursuits. Satan always has and always will look for ways to use technology to lead to our destruction, but with the guidance of the Holy Ghost, those same technologies can be a great blessing to us and our families and to those we serve.</p>
<p>In April of 2009, Elder David A. Bednar raised a clear voice of warning with regard to these new technologies. In a talk entitled “Things as They Really Are,” he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I raise an apostolic voice of warning about the potentially stifling, suffocating, suppressing, and constraining impact of some kinds of cyberspace interactions and experiences upon our souls. The concerns I raise are not new; they apply equally to other types of media, such as television, movies and music. But in a cyber-world, these challenges are more pervasive and intense. I plead with you to beware of the sense-dulling and spiritually destructive influence of cyberspace technologies that ... promote degrading and evil purposes.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>As Elder M. Russell Ballard taught in a CES devotional earlier this year, digital technologies should be our servants and not our masters.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>I invite each of you to seek revelation through the Holy Ghost so that truth will pervade all aspects of your lives–in your spiritual and academic studies, in your use of technology, and in your personal relationships. Don’t let technology and the things of this world become a distraction from the things that matter most, and&nbsp;<em>especially&nbsp;</em>don’t let Satan use technology to destroy you and your worthiness to receive revelation. You can be sure that as you are obedient to His commandments and seek His help in your personal life, He will reveal what you need to know for when you need to know it.</p>
<p>I testify that the Lord knows us and knows our capabilities. He knows that with the assistance of the Holy Ghost, we can learn and grow and do many wonderful things to hasten His work both while on this campus and in the years to come. We can be an influence for good and “Saviors on Mount Zion” in ways that would have been unimaginable just a few short years ago, but it requires our preparing by learning all we can and then applying that learning to assist in His work.</p>
<p>I testify that as we do so, our lives will be filled with the blessings of heaven. We will reap a bounteous harvest, and great will be our joy with those we influence. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140909<br><title>His Hands | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>September 9, 2014<br />Norman S. Black<br />Vice President of Administration, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha.</p>
<p>I am grateful to my wonderful wife for all the joy and happiness she brings into my life and into our home through her loving hands. I pray each day that I may bring joy into her life that will match the joy she brings into mine. Brothers and sisters, if you get nothing else from this Devotional today, get this: pray that you can make your spouse happier each day than he or she makes you.</p>
<p>I want to thank Kyla and Ani for the beautiful hymn in which was referenced our Savior who suffered and died for us on the cross with nails driven through His hands. We recognize those hands as part of the Atonement, which allows us to return and live with Him again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I would like to reflect on the living hands of the Savior and how we can make those hands part of our daily lives. I will consider three ways in which we can do this. First, there are times when we need to prayerfully seek the hands of the Lord to bless our lives. Second, at times, in answer to the prayers of others, we become the Lord’s hands to bless their lives. And last, we need to recognize when the hands of the Lord are touching our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the creation of this earth, the Savior served as the hands of our Father in Heaven. This established a pattern that the Savior would follow throughout His life in accomplishing the Lord’s work, and it also sets a pattern for us to follow in our lives.</p>
<p>The Savior was preparing Himself from His early years to become the Lord’s hands. Luke writes that as a child, the Savior “grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/2.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">Luke 2:40</a>).</p>
<p>He continued this preparation through His youth. At the age of twelve, He was “in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, and they were hearing him, and asking him questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers” (Luke 2:46-47, JST).</p>
<p>Early in His ministry, He goes to the river Jordon seeking John the Baptist to be baptized of him, thus making a covenant with the Lord to always remember Him and to keep His commandments. When we were baptized, we took upon us these same sacred covenants. Alma teaches that the baptismal covenant means that we are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light and “are willing to mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:8-10</a>). In other words, when we are baptized, we are willing to become the hands of the Lord in other’s lives.</p>
<p>As the Savior’s ministry continues, we see Him healing the sick, causing the blind to see and the lame to walk and restoring life where it had been taken away. He taught us the beatitudes and the commandments, showed us the way, and demonstrated how we can become the Lord’s hands.</p>
<p>Because the Savior loved us, He promised us that He will not forget us because He has “graven [us] upon the palms of [His] hands” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/49.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Isaiah 49:16</a>). And our promise to Him must be that we will not forget Him, for we have engraven Him upon the flesh of our hearts.</p>
<p>To become His hands, we must first have unconditional love for one another, but it cannot simply stop at love. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf stated, “True love requires action. … Christ did not just speak about love; He showed it each day of His life. He did not remove Himself from the crowd. Being amidst the people, Jesus reached out to the one. He rescued the lost. He didn’t just teach a class about reaching out in love and then delegate the actual work to others. He not only taught but also showed us how to “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.” … When the Savior stretches out His hands, those He touches are uplifted and become greater, stronger, and better people as a result. If we are His hands, should we not do the same?” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/you-are-my-hands?lang=eng" target="_blank">You Are My Hands</a>," General Conference, April 2010).</p>
<p>When I was about seven years old, my uncle built us a new house. After we moved in, he started building the home next to us. It was to be the home of my friend Johnny. One day after school, Johnny and I were walking home, and Johnny excitedly told me that they now had electricity in their house. He wanted to show me, so we anxiously ran to his new home that was nearing completion. There were no workers around, so Johnny plugged in a construction lamp in the living room and ran down the hall to the electrical circuit box where he turned on the electricity. Sure enough, the lamp turned on. We were excited, and I told Johnny that I wanted to try. He turned the electricity back off. and the plan was then for me to plug in the lamp, and he would turn the electricity back on. Johnny was down the hall out of site and waited a time for me to get the lamp plugged in. Then he turned the electricity back on. Unfortunately, I was still holding onto the plug, and the electricity shot up my arm and down the side of my body and out my right foot. When it did this, it caught my clothes on fire along with the new carpet.</p>
<p>I don’t remember much about the experience after that. I remember someone pushing me to the ground outside to put the fire out. I don’t remember the trip to the doctor, but I do remember lying in a tub of cold water and then laying on my bed with pillows all under my right side. I also know that I received a priesthood blessing that night from my dad. I don't remember the words that were spoken, but I know at that moment, my father was the Lord’s hands as he blessed me, and I was healed. Today, I do not have a single mark on my body to remind me of that experience, just a lasting impression on my heart of the power of the holy priesthood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was not the first, nor was it the last, blessing I received at my father’s hands. Each time that I was sick, I never wanted the doctor. I just wanted the Savior’s hands in the form of my earthly father to bless me and heal me, and they always did. I am eternally grateful to my father for his wonderful example of a priesthood man and for the love he showed as he served as the Lord’s hands in blessing me and our family.</p>
<p>Brethren of the priesthood, we have a responsibility to exercise the sacred priesthood authority in service to our fellowmen each time we are called upon to do so. As we do this, we literally become the hands of the Lord. We must realize that when the time for action has arrived, the time for preparation is passed. When we are unworthy to exercise our priesthood, we deprive others of being blessed by His hands, and we deny ourselves of the blessing of being His hands.</p>
<p>There are always those that are in need of His hands. President Thomas S. Monson said, “My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness—be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers. We are the Lord’s hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/what-have-i-done-for-someone-today?lang=eng" target="_blank">What Have I Done for Someone Today?</a>" General Conference, October 2009).</p>
<p>We recognize the period of time that we serve as full-time missionaries as a time in which we are anxiously engaged daily as the Lord’s hands. Many are the prayers that reach to heaven, pleading for the Lord’s hands to watch over His missionaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my first month in the mission field, my companion and I were riding our bikes along a six-lane road in front of the train station. This was generally a very busy road, but as it was lunch time, there was not much traffic. We needed to cross the road to get to the train station. My companion was riding in front of me and started across the road. Riding a bike in a foreign country still made me a little nervous, and I hesitated in following my companion. My companion was nearly across the road when I looked back to check for cars. All I saw was a single car a little ways behind me. I felt it was safe, so I started across the road. As I looked again, a car that had been hidden behind the other car pulled out and was accelerating directly toward me. I’m sure I began pedaling harder to avoid being hit, but the next thing I remember was taking a couple of steps and then standing by the side of my companion who was sitting on the other side of the road, looking back at what was happening. The car continued down the road, and my bike was left lying in the middle of the road, spinning around. I went out into the road and picked up my bike, which I had to carry home because the back tire was twisted and mangled. I realized that day that the many prayers of my family and others had invited the Lord’s hand to reach down and protect one of His missionaries. I needed His hand, and He was there.</p>
<p>Blessings await those who become the Lord’s hands. President Uchtdorf taught that “as we emulate His perfect example, our hands can become His hands; our eyes, His eyes; our heart, His heart. ... As we extend our hands and hearts toward others in Christlike love, something wonderful happens to us. Our own spirits become healed, more refined, and stronger. We become happier, more peaceful, and more receptive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. ... As we contemplate with reverence and awe how our Savior embraces us, comforts us, and heals us, let us commit to become His hands, that others through us may feel His loving embrace" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/you-are-my-hands?lang=eng" target="_blank">You Are My Hands</a>," General Conference, April 2010).</p>
<p>While living in Colorado, we were partners in a wilderness camp which had a 24-foot climbing wall as one of the adventures. Our sons always worked at the camp in the summer. One week on the first day of camp, our son Chris, who was 14-years old at the time, was part of the maintenance crew. Because he was so quick and nimble, the staff member at the climbing wall had sent him up the wall to hang the climbing rope. However, they had failed to give him safety gear to get back down. He quickly climbed the wall and hung the rope, but as he started back down, he slipped and fell about 20 feet to the ground. He landed hard on his right foot, and it began to swell. I had to go back to town to work, but Chris didn’t want to leave the camp, so I let him stay. Before I left, we gave him a blessing. On Friday evening, I returned to the camp and found Chris still limping and his foot still swollen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturday morning, I took him to the doctor, and x-rays showed that the main bone in his foot had been shattered. There were only two large pieces left. Chris was scheduled for surgery, and the doctor hoped he could screw the two large pieces back together, but there wasn't a whole lot more that could be done with the many small broken pieces. The doctor feared that the bone was so shattered that it would die and never heal. A priesthood blessing was given, and Chris went in for surgery. When we returned to the doctor six weeks after the surgery, the doctor asked us to join him in the x-ray viewing room. He had the original and the new x-rays he had just taken posted side by side on the wall. The doctor shook his head as he pointed out the bone that had been broken. All the shattered pieces had moved back together and reformed the bone, and it was alive and well. He turned to me and said, "We had a little help with that one, didn't we?" He recognized the Lord’s hand in healing the foot of our son. We were grateful for the blessing we had received.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we should always seek the Lord’s hands when we are in need and seek to become the Lord’s hands when we are needed.</p>
<p>The sisters of the Church are such a powerful force for good in this world. During the time I served as a bishop in a family ward, I had three wonderful sisters that were called as the Relief Society president. Each of these sisters faced their own personal challenges during the period of time in which they served. They could have given up at any time, but they didn’t. I was humbled as they faithfully worked through their trials and served the sisters and families of the ward, caring for the needy, helping the sick, delivering needed food, teaching sisters to cook, spiritually feeding the sisters each Sunday and throughout the week, and the list goes on. Usually, when I got a report that a particular family was experiencing difficulties, these wonderful leaders had already engaged the sisters of the Relief Society and were well on their way to meeting the family’s needs. Each of these sisters became, and continues today, to be the Lord’s hands in faithful service to their families and those around them. I love and appreciate these wonderful sisters, their thoughtful service, their inspired leadership and council, and the support of the wonderful sisters of the Relief Society that served with them.</p>
<p>Sister Julie B. Beck, a former Relief Society general president, stated, “Our compassionate service and assistance with the welfare needs of individuals and families are an outgrowth of visiting teaching. A Relief Society president learns of the needs of people in her ward through visiting teachers and her own visits to ward members. Sometimes she organizes us to help others, and at other times we serve “according to [our] natures,” following the promptings of the Holy Ghost. ... We can know with certainty that our Father in Heaven knows us personally because He sends us to be His hands and heart to those in need. As we do so, our faith in Him is strengthened” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/relief-society-a-sacred-work?lang=eng" target="_blank">Relief Society: A Sacred Work</a>," General Conference, October 2009).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have watched the many sisters in our young single adult wards privately extend their loving hands each day in service to others. They are not looking for recognition among men. They are not always doing big things, but they are always doing something, and that makes a difference. Whether it is for a roommate, a neighbor, a fellow sister in the Relief Society, a spouse, or someone she may not even know, her charitable hands of love are extended to those in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now brothers and sisters, I know that sometimes we feel inadequate; we feel that we are weak and lack the strength to help and assist others, but the Savior taught us that it is not the big things in life we do but all of the little things that make the difference. He taught, “Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.34-40?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">Matthew 25:34-40</a>).</p>
<p>The scriptures provide us another example of some young men who took no thought for themselves but sought only to serve others. Each of these young men turned down the opportunity to be the Nephite king and instead desired to go on missions among their enemies the Lamanites. In Alma, we read that the Sons of Mosiah “fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">Alma 17:9</a>). Instead of following their temporal desires that could have provided them a life of luxury as the king of the Nephites, they instead followed the desires of their hearts, and they sought to become the hands of the Lord to their brethren the Lamanites.</p>
<p>We all know that despite their hardships, these brethren faithfully served and brought many to the understanding of the gospel who were baptized unto the Lord. The experiences of the sons of Mosiah are a striking example of seeking, recognizing, and becoming the Lord’s hands. If we really want to be instruments in God’s hands, that desire will permeate our prayers and be the focus of our fasting just as it was for the Sons of Mosiah.</p>
<p>When we prayerfully seek opportunities to become the Lord’s hands, we often receive promptings regarding God’s children. When we act upon those promptings and are obedient to the righteous impressions we receive, God gives us additional opportunities to serve and grow. We must be ready to be an instrument in His hands so that He can use us anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Early in our marriage, we lived in Oklahoma where I was called to be the Elder's Quorum president. It was a ward spread over a large area and included many of the Lord’s sheep that needed rescued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My counselor and I went out one evening to find the Davis family, a family unknown to anyone in the ward. We drove to the address listed in the Church records and knocked on the door. The man who answered the door said he had lived in that house for many years and that he did not know Lamar Davis. As we drove away from the house and rounded the bend on the street, the thought came to me that it was possible that some of the numbers in the address had been reversed. I mentioned this to my counselor. There were four numbers in the address, and we switched the middle two. When we looked up, the house we were sitting in front of was that house number. We looked at each other and knew we had to knock on that door. We did so, and this time, Lamar Davis answered the door. He invited us in, and over the next few months, the Davis family was taught the gospel, and Brother Davis was able to baptize his two children. The Lord's hand had reached out to one of His lost sheep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the story doesn't end there. The Davises became good friends and often would babysit our young son Skyler. Linda was nearing the delivery date of our second son, and it was our wedding anniversary. Our anniversary dinner was cut short when we had to rush to the hospital for our second son’s birth. The Davises lived close by, so on our way to the hospital, we dropped Skyler off at their home. They kept Skyler through the night, and we never worried about him for a minute. Now their hands had become the Lord's hands in our time of need, and they had reached out and served us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Benjamin taught, “And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:17</a>). In other words, when we are serving others, we are the Lord’s hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I turn to those who have touched my life, whose hands have left an everlasting impression etched on my heart because of their examples and love. This list is long, so I will mention only a few.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First are the hands of my beloved mother. There are no hands like a mother’s hands, especially my mother’s hands. Her hands could type 120 words per minute on a manual typewriter, which she often did to help me complete my school reports. She cooked, cleaned, washed and ironed clothes, bottled fruit and vegetables we grew in our garden, and just about anything else. My mother’s hands have made many quilts that cover the beds of her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. And there was nothing like her arms and hands wrapped around us, giving us love and support in our daily lives and in our times of need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I watched her tender hands as she took care of her parents in their old age. Grandma had cancer, and mom cared for her until her death and then took care of my grandfather until he passed away. Her hands are loving hands of service.</p>
<p>I also honor the hands of my mother-in-law. Her hands have served her family dutifully for all the years of her life. She continues to serve today by assembling histories of her ancestors, which are shared with her posterity. Her hands bring their stories to life, and they are remembered today, and their temple work is completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loved are the hands of a mother. Their love is great, and they are truly the Lord's hands each day of their lives.</p>
<p>Next are the hands of my father. They were not the hands of a skilled surgeon, a rocket scientist, or a company CEO but rather the hands of a worthy priesthood man that supported our family. There is a definite dignity in the hands that give honest labor and toil tirelessly for a wife and eight children. We knew he loved us because he was a faithful priesthood holder who stood at the head of our home and whose hands were always in service to his family. I honor the hands of my father.</p>
<p>I also honor the hands of my father-in-law. His countless acts of service to many in the community were fondly remembered at his funeral last year. His good friend told of many occasions where help was needed and without being asked, he would show up with his tractors, do the work, and then leave without notice, never charging a dime to someone in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, each member of my family and my wife’s family tries to honor our parents by living our lives as they lived theirs: in service as the Lord’s hands to our families, neighbors, friends, and all who are in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My grandparents were wonderful examples of the Lord's hands. Each of them were called as temple missionaries. They became wonderful servants of the Lord as His hands and helped me develop a love for the temple. My grandfather was set apart as a temple sealer and became the Lord's hands to many of his posterity and others as he sealed them for time and all eternity in the holy temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I turn the clock back 33 years to a time described by President Monson. Said he, “Then comes that day when the hand of a boy takes the hand of a girl, and parents suddenly realize their children have grown. Never is the hand of a girl so delicately displayed as when there glistens on her finger a ring denoting a sacred pledge. Her step becomes quicker, her countenance brighter, and all is well with the world. Courtship has come. Marriage follows. And once again two hands are clasped, this time in a holy temple. Cares of the world are for a brief moment forgotten. Thoughts turn to eternal values. The clasped hands speak of promised hearts. Heaven is here” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/08/hands?lang=eng" target="_blank">Hands</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, August 1990).</p>
<p>I will never forget the day when my sweetheart knelt across the altar from me in the St. George temple, and we made an eternal covenant with one another and with our Heavenly Father. To this day, she provides the most humble example of the Lord's hands in my life. I look at our four wonderful sons, and the men they have become. They are strong priesthood holders of God, two of whom have been married in His holy temple, sealed to their wives and children for time and for all eternity. Our third son Cory will be sealed to his sweetheart Katie in just a couple of months. Our fourth son Brandon serves as a deacon and always extends a loving and helpful hand to all around him always with a joyful smile on his face.</p>
<p>I think of the many years that their wonderful mother was with them every day, playing with them, reading to them from the scriptures and storybooks, teaching them the gospel, getting them ready for church meetings and school, fixing wonderful meals, patching their little cuts and scrapes, and the list goes on. I also think of the many charitable acts she has done in my behalf which are too many to list, the patience she has always had with my faults, and the joy and happiness she brings into my life every day through her service. Treasured and loved are the hands of my wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last, we are all indebted to the loving hands of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. His Atonement alone makes it possible for us to return and be with our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales stated, “I am especially impressed as I consider the week leading to His death: the chief priests challenged His authority, tried to trap Him, and twice conspired to kill Him. In Gethsemane, while His disciples slept, He suffered the sins of all mankind and bled from every pore. He was betrayed, arrested, questioned, struck, spat upon, and beaten. After interrogation by the ruling council, He was mocked by Herod and finally taken to Pilate, where He was made to stand before an angry mob. Whipped and crowned with thorns, He was forced to carry His cross to Golgotha. Nails were driven into His hands and feet. His body was raised up between common thieves. Soldiers cast lots for His earthly possessions, and vinegar was given to quench His thirst. After six hours, He commended His spirit into the hands of His Father, gave up the ghost, and died” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/faith-through-tribulation-brings-peace-and-joy?lang=eng" target="_blank">Faith through Tribulation Brings Peace and Joy</a>," General Conference, April 2003).</p>
<p>I am grateful for the sacrifice and Atonement of the Savior, the life He lived, the lessons he taught, and the example he set. It is my testimony that His hands have touched each of our lives in many ways. We are forever indebted to His hands, hands that rescued each of us through His atonement. That we may be instruments in His hands in serving the precious lambs for which He gave His life is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
