<p>To all of you, our dear brothers and sisters, colleagues and friends, Madelyn and I express our most heartfelt aloha.</p>
<p>We have been blessed beyond measure to live and work here in this very special place for the past 33 years. It was April 1983 when President Elliott Cameron, then the president of BYUH, came to my office in Beaver, Utah, and asked me to come to Hawaii to help establish a full service Health Center on campus. I had lived here as a young missionary in the summer of 1969. I had been called to serve in the Southern Far East mission and to serve in Taiwan. The language training program had just been instituted by the church, and the Asian and Pacific Language Training Mission was here in Hale 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the years after my mission, as we made our way through pharmacy school, then medical school and further residency training, we had always thought that we would return to our hometown in Southern Utah to live the rest of our lives. However, we often felt that something was missing and that we needed to look beyond our original plans. It was a difficult decision to leave our home, family, and successful practice, and move out here to Laie. As many of you know, it is always difficult to be far away from family and familiar things and venture into “unknown” situations. We are facing many of the same emotions now, as we prepare to leave our home here and move on to the next chapter of our lives.</p>
<p>As we look back on the years we have spent here, we have become more aware of how short life is and how fast the time goes. We have been reminded many times of the thoughts expressed by Nephi, as he talked about the Lord preparing a way to accomplish the things that He commands us to do<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a>&nbsp;</sup>and how the spirit will lead us along, even though we may not know “beforehand, the things which we should do."<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>As we have tried to follow promptings and respond appropriately, we have been blessed with many wonderful opportunities to witness the hand of the Lord working in our lives and the lives of those we have associated with. One of my favorite scriptures when I started on my mission, and as we have moved through life together, is from Abraham as he was describing the emotions that his family was experiencing as they were leaving their home and moving to new and unfamiliar places and experiences: “Therefore, eternity was our covering and our rock and our salvation, as we journeyed…”.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> Earlier in this chapter he described a very sacred encounter with the Lord and received great blessings and promises, as he faithfully followed the path that was put before him. He describes how he and Lot, his brother’s son, prayed, and the Lord appeared to them. Pay particular attention to the words and promises and how we might apply these principles in our own lives on the paths and choices that we face. Starting in Abraham chapter 2, verse 6, the Lord tells him to arise and take Lot with him: “for I have purposed to take thee away out of Haran, and to make of thee a minister to bear my name in a strange land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken to my voice”. The Lord then declares who He is and testifies of His power to create and control the earth and elements. He declares His name, Jehovah, that He knows the end from the beginning, and that His hand would be over them. Then the promise of the Abrahamic covenant assures that he would be a great nation and be blessed above measure, and that the power of the priesthood would be borne by his seed to all nations to bless all the families of the earth with the blessings of salvation and eternal life.</p>
<p>Now, how do these promises apply to us? What evidence do we have that our lives truly are eternal and will never end? &nbsp;A few years ago, I had the great blessing and opportunity to serve in the Stake Presidency of the BYUH 1st Stake with President Keith Pearce and President Judd Whetten. We felt strongly impressed that we should emphasize a program of training in our wards as we met in ward conferences that was structured around the scripture in D&amp;C 43:34-35: “Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;We tried to outline a plan that would help each individual member of our stake better understand what is meant by the “solemnities of eternity,” and how a personal knowledge and testimony of the reality of eternity could be a covering a rock and salvation in our lives just as Abraham had described.</p>
<p>If you read earlier in section 43, we get a clearer view of the context in which the admonition from the Lord was given. The Lord is making it very clear that the time is short and that we would soon see many signs and warnings that He would come soon. He gives counsel and assignments that are similar to those given to Abraham. Look at verses 15-35, particularly the call to “teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my spirit; and ye are to be taught from on high,” and be endowed with power as you are sanctified. He then issues graphic descriptions of warnings and events that we will see and that even in the midst of turmoil, His voice and mercy will still be heard and that “the riches of eternal life” would still be available to those willing to receive them, but that this is the last time that the inhabitants of the earth would be called upon, and the Millennium would soon come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our training, we focused on the great need for everyone to prepare for and always be worthy to enter the temple, where we would be endowed with that promised power and be taught more about “the solemnities of eternity” so that we might share those eternal truths with so many of our Father’s children who do not know Him or His plan for them. We tried to establish the link to Abraham’s promise and blessing by sharing the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood from section 84, starting in verse 32. I will share just a few highlights and leave it to you to study in the section in greater detail. The Lord declares that as we faithfully obtain the priesthood and magnify our callings, we will be sanctified by the Spirit, unto the renewing of our bodies, and become the sons of Moses, Aaron, and the seed of Abraham. He promises that He has given heavenly hosts and angels charge concerning us, and that we should beware, to give heed to the words of ETERNAL LIFE. He describes the whole world being in the bondage of sin and darkness and admonishes us that condemnation will rest upon even the children of Zion, unless we repent and remember “the new covenant”, The Book of Mormon. He then later uses the word “solemnity” again as He indicates that we can be forgiven if we “remain steadfast in our minds, in solemnity and the spirit of prayer” and that we bear testimony to all the world of the things communicated to us. Again, later in the section, more great promises are given that will allow us more opportunities to feel the reality of eternal beings around us. Starting in verse 87, He promises that as we go out in His name to teach the world of a judgment that is coming that He will go before our face and “be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in our hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up”. He then finishes the revelation with another powerful witness of eternal reality, verse 119: “For I the Lord have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven, ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye shall see it, and know that I am and that I will come and reign with my people.”</p>
<p>How then can we remember these eternal realities and prepare ourselves for that which is to come. Is it important to gain a personal witness that eternity is real? &nbsp;We know that the Lord has warned us many times about the dangers of being deceived, especially if we dwell only on the present, lose sight of our eternal destiny, and forget who we truly are. Recall the details of Lehi’s dream and the graphic descriptions of the many ways that we might lose our focus and lose our way. The eternal goal, life forever with our Father, surrounded by His love, represented by the tree of life is there, but it is a difficult path to get there. There are mists of darkness, confusion and criticisms from the world, personal shame and guilt, and too often the loss of our grip on the iron rod or the word of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes from The Lord of The Rings is Sam talking to Frodo as they too are leaving their familiar territory in the Shire and embarking on a journey that would be filled with danger and trials, as he shares counsel that he had received, “It is a dangerous business Frodo, going out of your door, you step into the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to”. We have been warned that in our day, “There shall arise false Christ’s and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect”.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> We have also heard the description that “men’s hearts shall fail them”. I would like to share a few thoughts on this from Elder Holland in his talk “Safety for the Soul” from October 2009<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup> Conference. He asks us to “think of the heart as the figurative center of our faith, the poetic location of our loyalties and our values.” If these central structures of our character and identity are lost, then our “hearts” are truly failing as we become lost and confused without our eternal anchors.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s once again ask ourselves the questions, what evidence do we have that eternity is real, and is there really something beyond this life? &nbsp;</p>
<p>In his book Here We Stand, Joseph Fielding McConkie declared this important instructive counsel:</p>
<p>“The way we answer questions about our faith ought to be by finding the quickest and most direct route to the Sacred Grove. That is our ground. It is sacred ground. It is where the heavens are opened and the God of heaven speaks. It is where testimonies are born and the greatest truths of heaven are unveiled.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Joseph Smith was told in Section 122:1-2 that “The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee; While the pure in heart, and the wise and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Note again the reference to “heart,” but this time is the often used phrase “pure in heart.” How “pure” is the heart of our own personal testimony of the truths declared and restored through the prophet Joseph?</p>
<p>How well are our hearts prepared that we will not be deceived by the multitude of voices that will surround us and try to convince us that Joseph Smith was a fraud and that we are fools to follow him?</p>
<p>Remember the warning from Section 84 about forgetting the Book of Mormon. President Benson spoke frequently about the importance of having a personal testimony of Joseph Smith and The Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>In his conference talk in October, 1986, he explained in great detail why this is “The KEYSTONE of our religion,” and how important it is in obtaining and maintaining our own personal witness of the eternal truths that are there for us to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My beloved brethren and sisters, today I would like to speak about one of the most significant gifts given to the world in modern times. The gift I am thinking of is more important than any of the inventions that have come out of the industrial and technological revolutions. This is a gift of greater value to mankind than even the many wonderful advances we have seen in modern medicine. It is of greater worth to mankind than the development of flight or space travel. I speak of the gift of the Book of Mormon, given to mankind 156 years ago.</p>
<p>This gift was prepared by the hand of the Lord over a period of more than a thousand years, then hidden up by Him so that it would be preserved in its purity for our generation. Perhaps there is nothing that testifies more clearly of the importance of this modern book of scripture than what the Lord Himself has said about it.</p>
<p>By His own mouth He has borne witness (1) that it is true,<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> (2) that it contains the truth and His words,<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup> (3) that it was translated by power from on high,<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> (4) that it contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ,<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup> (5) that it was given by inspiration and confirmed by the ministering of angels,<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup> (6) that it gives evidence that the holy scriptures are true,<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup> and (7) that those who receive it in faith shall receive eternal life.<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. This was the Prophet Joseph Smith’s statement. He testified that “the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion”.<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup> A keystone is the central stone in an arch. It holds all the other stones in place, and if removed, the arch crumbles….</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is the keystone of testimony. Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it.</p>
<p>There are three ways in which the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. It is the keystone in our witness of Christ. It is the keystone of our doctrine. It is the keystone of testimony.</p>
<p>Brethren and sisters, I implore you with all my heart that you consider with great solemnity the importance of the Book of Mormon to you personally and to the Church collectively.</p>
<p>Over ten years ago I made the following statement regarding the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p>Do eternal consequences rest upon our response to this book? Yes, either to our blessing or our condemnation.</p>
<p>Every Latter-day Saint should make the study of this book a lifetime pursuit. Otherwise he is placing his soul in jeopardy and neglecting that which could give spiritual and intellectual unity to his whole life. There is a difference between a convert who is built on the rock of Christ through the Book of Mormon and stays hold of that iron rod, and one who is not”.<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>I reaffirm those words to you this day. Let us not remain under condemnation, with its scourge and judgment, by treating lightly this great and marvelous gift the Lord has given to us. Rather, let us win the promises associated with treasuring it up in our hearts.”</p>
<p>We will all face our own personal trials, times of pain and doubt, fear, and may begin to question whether or not He is truly there. We will be able to stand through these times if we have put forth the effort to know for ourselves that Joseph Smith is the Lord’s prophet and that the Book of Mormon is truly a second witness that He lives, and that our lives have eternal purpose. Remember the promises and counsel that the Lord gave to the prophet as he was imprisoned in Liberty jail, as he pleaded with the Lord, wondering where He was and why so many hard trials had come to him and the rest of the members of the church who were being persecuted, driven from their homes, and many losing their lives. The Lord reminded Joseph of the reality of priesthood power and how to access it. He outlined several essential attributes that we would all need to develop and understand: persuasion, long suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned, charity, virtue. Then, as we make these attributes part of the “heart” of our lives and behavior, He gives the promise that our confidence would wax strong in His presence, in other words we will feel worthy and comfortable to be where He is, and that His priesthood power would “distill upon our souls”. We would have the constant companionship of The Holy Ghost and have an everlasting dominion. He then counseled the prophet in section 122 about all of the fierce trials that might come, and that He understands them all, as He declared “The Son of Man hath descended below them all, art thou greater than He? Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.”</p>
<p>This promise has been a great comfort to us so often in our lives, and I have shared it many times with so many of our Father’s children who felt lost, lonely, hopeless, and that life seemed so unfair. Let’s listen to the words to one of our favorite Primary songs.</p>
<p>“A Child’s Prayer”</p>
<p>Lyrics</p>
<p>1. Heavenly Father, are you really there?</p>
<p>And do you hear and answer ev'ry child's prayer?</p>
<p>Some say that heaven is far away,</p>
<p>But I feel it close around me as I pray.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father, I remember now</p>
<p>Something that Jesus told disciples long ago:</p>
<p>"Suffer the children to come to me."</p>
<p>Father, in prayer I'm coming now to thee.</p>
<p>2. Pray, he is there;</p>
<p>Speak, he is list'ning.</p>
<p>You are his child;</p>
<p>His love now surrounds you.</p>
<p>He hears your prayer;</p>
<p>He loves the children.</p>
<p>Of such is the kingdom, the kingdom of heav'n.<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>I would like to share a few personal experiences from our lives as we have felt and seen and personally witnessed the unmistakable power and love of our living Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>We have known many great and noble spirits here in this special place. Our faith and testimonies have been forever strengthened by what we have witnessed in the lives of so many faithful servants of our Father. In my work in medicine, I have felt on countless occasions His healing power step in where my professional knowledge and skill had reached their limit. I have witnessed miraculous healings. Some who had crossed the veil came back and told me of their experiences being on both sides. I have seen the hand of our Father reach out to His children and felt His thoughts and words flow through my mind and my mouth to express His love for them. I have felt impressions come to my mind to look for something or think of something that I would not have otherwise done without His influence and His love for each individual. I have also seen many times when healing did not occur and witnessed the pain and heartache of loss. It is often difficult to understand or explain when it seems that prayers are not being answered in the way that we want. These are truly the times when our “hearts” are tested and tried. Do we really trust Him and put ourselves in His hands and say, “Thy will be done.” We had some dear friends who lost a young son in a flash flood while he was on his first overnight camp with the Boy Scouts. He and our son were walking together and both were swept into the flood waters together. How do you explain why one is taken to the other side of the veil, and the other one, our son, remains here? &nbsp; It is in these times, however, that we feel His comforting reassurance that eternity truly is our “rock and our salvation”, that the promises given by The Lord in D&amp;C 121-122 are literally true, and that He understands.</p>
<p>The beginning of our eternal family was July 21, 1972, when Madelyn and I knelt together across the altar in the St. George Temple and were sealed for eternity. The transcendent joy of that hour and the eternal promises given on that day gave us strength to face other days of trial and testing that surely came and will continue to come as long as we are here on this side of the veil. How grateful I am for a loving, devoted, faithful daughter of God who is my eternal companion. She has truly put her life in jeopardy, and demonstrated great faith in becoming a mother to our five children. Priesthood power has preserved her life and theirs. We have witnessed heavenly visits from across the veil that came as answers to heartfelt prayers regarding our children.</p>
<p>Most recently we have been called upon to face some of the most difficult challenges of our lives, as my dear sweetheart again went to deaths doorstep with a massive stroke three and a half years ago, that left her paralyzed on her left side. Through all of that time, we have again witnessed the undeniable power, and reassurance of our Father, that His will would prevail, and that our eternal covenants, made in His holy temple bind us together and assure us of eternity together if we stay the course, “hold on our way”, and not lose our “hearts”, the core of eternal truths that we will never deny. We have felt the presence of loved ones and friends from across the veil, knowing that our Father is keeping His promise to send them to be “round about us to bear us up.”</p>
<p>This scene here today, with her being here and us bearing testimony to you, was shown to me in a dream on the Sunday morning two days after her stroke. It was that day that she had the surgery on her brain that saved her life. However, we still did not know how much damage had been done and whether she would wake up. The image in the dream, I know, was a tender mercy, an expression of reassurance from our loving Father, that we still had things to do together on this side of the veil. The reason I am not wearing a suit today, but am wearing my white shirt and white tie that I wear in the temple is to remember a very sacred event that took place on Christmas Eve 2012, ten days after she had her stroke. As we were getting ready to go to the hospital as a family to be with her on that night, I felt strongly impressed to put on this shirt and tie. We went to the hospital where she was still unconscious in the ICU. She had not opened her eyes for ten days. We sang Christmas songs around her bed, and I again felt strong impressions come to my mind, that I should take her right hand and bless her to awaken and return with me to the house of the Lord. As I said these words in my mind, she squeezed my hand and briefly opened her eyes. Even though she still had breathing tubes in her mouth and throat, she gave me a small, beautiful smile, then closed her eyes again for another two weeks.</p>
<p>We will be forever grateful for so many of you and for our dear children and extended family who have truly been “angels round about us, to bear us up” during this most difficult time in our lives. We know that you have been the promised angels sent to us on this side of the veil, just like those on the other side who care for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for the sacrifices that you have made for us. We are reminded of the promise of the Savior in the song “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief”: “These deeds shall thy memorial be, fear not thou didst them unto me.” &nbsp;Surely you have filled your spiritual lamps with your loving service.</p>
<p>The reality of angels on both sides of the veil, is yet another witness of the reality of eternity.</p>
<p>Elder Holland testified of the importance of and the reality of angels in his article in The Ensign, January 1996:</p>
<p>“Moroni who, quoting his father, says:</p>
<p>‘And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing.</p>
<p>“For behold, God knowing all things, being from everlasting to everlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children of men, to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ. …&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ” (Moro. 7:21–22, 25; emphasis added).</p>
<p>I am convinced that one of the profound themes of the Book of Mormon is the role and prevalence and central participation of angels in the gospel story.”<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>He again testified of “The Ministry of Angels” in his conference talk in October 2008</p>
<p>“I testify that angels are still sent to help us, even as they were sent to help Adam and Eve, to help the prophets, and indeed to help the Savior of the world himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have spoken here of heavenly help, of angels dispatched to bless us in time of need. But when we speak of those who are instruments in the hand of God, we are reminded that not all angels are from the other side of the veil. Some of them we walk with and talk with—here, now, every day. Some of them reside in our own neighborhoods. Some of them gave birth to us, and in my case, one of them consented to marry me. Indeed heaven never seems closer than when we see the love of God manifested in the kindness and devotion of people so good and so pure that angelic is the only word that comes to mind.</p>
<p>My beloved brothers and sisters, I testify of angels, both the heavenly and the mortal kind. In doing so I am testifying that God never leaves us alone, never leaves us unaided in the challenges that we face. Nor will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man or woman or child upon the face thereof to be saved. 13 On occasions, global or personal, we may feel we are distanced from God, shut out from heaven, lost, alone in dark and dreary places. Often enough that distress can be of our own making, but even then the Father of us all is watching and assisting. And always there are those angels who come and go all around us, seen and unseen, known and unknown, mortal and immortal.”<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Our opportunity to live here at this time, in this place, is not just by chance. Some of the most important things that we can do to prepare for eternal life is to learn to become like the Savior and develop the attributes that He outlined that allow the power of the priesthood to flow through us, to help sustain and strengthen each other, and to always be ready to act in His stead as angels sent from Him. Then the promised “confidence” will come, and our “hearts” will be strong in the knowledge that He lives and loves us and that we will be with Him again soon. These are the “solemnities of eternity” that He wants us to “treasure in our hearts” and “rest upon our minds.”</p>
<p>As I close this talk and close this chapter of our lives here, I would like to share some quotes that have been very special to us, from a book called “Priests of the Most High God” by Donald E. Goff.</p>
<p>James E. Talmage declared, “What is man in this boundless setting of sublime splendor? &nbsp;I answer you: Potentially now and actually to be, he is greater and grander, more precious in the arithmetic of God than all the planets and the suns of space. For him they were created. They are His handiwork and man is His son.”</p>
<p>With this glory and majesty upon us, in the words of John Taylor, “We ought to be full of light and life and the power and spirit of the Living God and feel that we are messengers to the nations of the earth; we ought to feel the word of God burning like fire in our bones, feeling desirous to go and snatch men from the powers of darkness and the chains of corruption with which they are bound, and lead them in the paths of life. This should be our heart, and soul, something near and dear to us, the motivating force of our lives.”</p>
<p>Elder Wilford Woodruff declared: “There never was a generation of the inhabitants of the earth in any age of the world who had greater events awaiting them than the present… And an age fraught with greater interest to the children of men than the one in which we live never dawned since the creation of the world.”</p>
<p>Brother Goff then concludes with these words,</p>
<p>“We really need to wake up to the glorious and magnificent challenge of our day and time, and become a great and mighty people as God designed for us, a glorious standard of righteousness, an ensign to the nations and a welcoming beacon of brilliant light on the horizon, like the rising sun full of life giving light, inviting all people to enjoy the fullness of the glory of Christ and all that the Father hath, which is more than any of us can imagine. (D&amp;C 84:38)</p>
<p>To do this we need to realize who we are and act in full accord with our true identity as followers of light and truth, guardians of the crowning birthright blessings of Israel, and messengers of the covenant. We are sleeping giants with beautiful power beyond imagination. We can do great things, in His name, for we are involved in the greatest and most glorious work that was ever done for humanity. May we overflow with love for God and His children that the brilliant light of the Son of God might shine so beautifully in our lives that we magnify Him, whose servants we are”.<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, we thank you all for the love and light that you have shared with us.</p>
<p>May we all firmly establish in our hearts the eternal promises that we all share and may we always share the spirit of this very special place wherever we are called to serve Him throughout the world.</p>
<p>I leave my personal witness that I know beyond any doubt that our Father lives and loves us. His Son Jesus Christ stands at the head of this church. His priesthood power was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and remains with us through eternity. Thomas S. Monson is God’s living prophet on earth today. God bless you our dear eternal friends, until we meet again.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aloha &amp; Malo e lelei!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate and am very grateful for that kind and wonderful introduction by my lovely eternal companion. I want to thank our children for being here to share this time together as a family. They are the most important people in my life. I would also like to express my love to all of you and my extended family and friends who are here to support me in this assignment.</p>
<p>This is an unexpected opportunity and blessing I’ve been given to speak today and I feel very inadequate and humbled to be given this assignment. There are so many qualified individuals in this university who could have occupied this podium and who are much more eloquent and capable in the English language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I are members of the Hauula 4th Ward and we’re both Sunday School teachers teaching the 16 to 17 year olds. It is an honor for me to be with you, and I want you to know that you have made the right choice to be here at this devotional this morning. You are a glorious group, even a chosen generation, assembled here in the Cannon Activity Center at Brigham Young University Hawaii. I would like to acknowledge the presence of the President Council, our Stake Presidents, BYU Hawaii Student Body Officers, faculty, staff and our beloved students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While preparing for this assignment, I have been thinking about the many choices and decisions we as children of our Heavenly Father are called upon to make in our daily lives and the consequences of those choices. President Monson said concerning choices, “Some are trivial. Some are far-reaching. Some will make no difference in the eternal scheme of things, and others will make all the difference.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;My beloved brothers and sisters, it is my prayer this morning that I might enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost as I share my message with you. I would like to speak on this topic: “Decisions Determine Destiny”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Dr. Joel Hoomans of the Leading Edge Journal,</p>
<p>“Various internet sources estimate that an adult makes about 35,000 remotely conscious decisions each day (in contrast a child makes about 3,000). This number may sound absurd, but according to researchers at Cornell University<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup>, we make 226.7 decisions each day on just food alone. As your level of responsibility increases, so does the smorgasbord of choices you are faced with.</p>
<p>You and I have been given free will, or agency, and also a multitude of choices in life, like:</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what to eat</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what to wear</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what to purchase</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what we believe</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what jobs and career choices we will pursue</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>how we vote</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>who to spend our time with</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>who we will date and marry</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what we say and how we say it</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>whether or not we would like to have children</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what we will name our children</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>who our children spend their time with</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what they will eat, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each choice carries certain consequences - good and bad. This ability to choose is an incredible and exciting power that we have each been entrusted with by our Creator and for which we have an obligation to be good stewards of.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>How many decisions does a person make over a life time?</p>
<p>According to the UK News Mirror, “The average person will make 773,618 decisions over a lifetime – and will come to regret 143,262 of them.</p>
<p>A typical adult makes 27 judgments a day – usually starting with whether to turn off the alarm or hit snooze.</p>
<p>And each decision can take up to nine minutes, which adds up to a mind-numbing four hours lost in thought.</p>
<p>After polling 2,000 people, Tony Ablewhite, of the Puzzler Mind Gym 3D game, said: “We know it’s not always easy to make decisions. But we need to get better at making our minds up.”</p>
<p>What decisions have you made today? What decisions in your life do you regret?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints, we have been taught that we have a loving Heavenly Father who wants the best for all of his children but he will never do anything against our agency. As a result of our Father’s love, we have been sent here on earth to receive a mortal body and make decisions and choices. Being loving parents, my wife and I also want the best for our children. As a young couple, we lived in TVA, and after our first child was born, we tried our very best to raise our daughter with what we had learned. My wife, is a loving and nurturing mother, did an excellent job with our child. On the other hand, I was still trying to learn my responsibility as a father. In other words, I was undergoing on-the-job training, and I know I made a lot of mistakes throughout the process. Our three older children will agree with that. I was a very strict father and wanted to protect our children. I wanted them to be happy and to enjoy the opportunities this country has to offer. As parents, we have made choices for our children while they were younger, and as they get older, we still want them to honor those choices. We must remember that as our children get older, they should be making their own choices. We need to continue to support them in their choices and love them unconditionally. Yet this can be especially difficult when as a parent you see the coming consequences of those choices that they don’t see. We can learn from Alma, Lehi, Adam, and even our Heavenly Father, who have been through it all. We all come from different countries and cultures and have brought with us what have learned and how we choose to live. Personally I think that the gospel culture is the best one for me. We learn in Matthew 11:28-30 of the Savior’s invitation to all of us, and I quote:&nbsp;</p>
<p>28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
<p>29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
<p>30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I know that our Heavenly Father loves us in spite of our imperfection. We can always repent and try to do better. He knows our daily struggles as parents and he wants us to succeed and become like him for he is our Heavenly parent.</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson stated:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Youth of today are faced with monumental decisions. The world in which you live is not a play world or a Disney world. It is a very competitive world that will require the very best that you can bring to it, and it will reward you when your best efforts are put forth.</p>
<p>It is important to remember this solemn truth: Obedience to God’s law will bring liberty and eternal life, whereas disobedience will bring captivity and death. It has been said by one, years ago, that history turns on small hinges, and so do people’s lives. Our lives will depend upon the decisions which we make—for decisions determine destiny.”</p>
<p>The decisions we make have their eternal consequences, as we learn from the prophet Noah when the Lord told him to call the people to repent. “They laughed, mocked and they jeered as this prophet of God erected a vessel called an ark. But they ceased from their laughing and their jeering when the rain began to come and when the rain failed to cease. They had made a decision contrary to the instructions of God’s prophet, and they paid for that decision with their very lives.”</p>
<p>Lehi taught his son Jacob about our agency to choose, and I quote from 2Nephi2:27</p>
<p>"Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself."<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also learn from the book, “True to the Faith,” and I quote,</p>
<p>“You had the power to choose even before you were born. In the premortal Council in Heaven, Heavenly Father presented His plan, which included the principle of agency. Lucifer rebelled and “sought to destroy the agency of man”.<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup> As a result, Lucifer and all those who followed him were denied the privilege of receiving a mortal body. Your presence on the earth confirms that you exercised your agency to follow Heavenly Father’s plan.</p>
<p>In mortality, you continue to have agency. Your use of this gift determines your happiness or misery in this life and in the life to come. You are free to choose and act, but you are not free to choose the consequences of your actions. The consequences may not be immediate, but they will always follow. Choices of good and righteousness lead to happiness, peace, and eternal life, while choices of sin and evil eventually lead to heartache and misery.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the decisions you make. You should not blame your circumstances, your family, or your friends if you choose to disobey God’s commandments. You are a child of God with great strength. You have the ability to choose righteousness and happiness, regardless of your circumstances."<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young boy growing up in the island of Vava’u, I was blessed to have good people around me. At the age of two and half, my mother passed away, and I missed the blessing of being raised by her. I do not remember anything about my mother except what I have seen of her in pictures and what I read from her journal. My Dad was the closest person to me and we have become very close friends. I remember how I wanted to be around him and to do everything that he did. He was a very good father and mother to me. Every day I could not wait for him to come home from work so we can spend time together as father and son especially eating our favorite snacks. I think the most important thing that I remember about him was that he lived the gospel to the best of his ability. The gospel was everything to him after his family. He was not perfect but he tried his very best. That was important for me because I tried to follow in his footsteps and wanted to be just like him. I remember at times when I got into mischief, he did not punish me as most Tongan fathers did. He would talk to me not in an angry tone, but in a loving and peaceful way. Sometime I just wished that he could just hit me and get it over with it; but he did not and I will always remember that. I thank him for being such a great example to me of how he choose to live life like our Savior. Because of his good example, it was easier for me to choose the right. My family will tell you that I am far for being perfect, but I am trying to be a better man today than yesterday.</p>
<p>Let me share a few stories from the scriptures that will illustrate the importance of making right choices and decisions as well as how they impacted not only them as individuals but also all of us many years later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of the decision of Adam and Eve made in their beautiful home in the Garden of Eden. They had been given everything they could want for food and comfort. They knew nothing of evil, for their world was all good and they were happy.</p>
<p>The Lord would walk and talk with them, and their happiness was complete. Everything had been made for them to enjoy except one tree—the tree of knowledge of good and evil—and they were told they should neither touch nor eat the fruit of that tree, for if they did, they would be punished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one day Satan tempted Eve and Adam, and they disobeyed the Lord and ate the fruit was been forbidden. And when they had eaten it, they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and became mortals as we are, and the Lord told them that someday they would die. Was that a major life decision? Definitely a decision that has affected all human beings ever lived on this earth.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, we read about another family and the choices they made. Laman and Lemuel were commanded to go and obtain the brass plates from King Laban. The scripture indicated they murmured and said it was a hard thing that the Lord has asked of them. They decided not to obey and they lost the blessing. But Nephi, when he received the commandment, responded with that beautiful declaration: “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,” and he did; and he received the coveted prize that comes through obedience.</p>
<p>How about the decision made by a 14-year-old boy who was searching for the truth? He searched the scriptures and read that if anyone lacked wisdom, he should ask of God, “that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him”.<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> He put James’s promise to the test and he went to the grove to pray. “Was that a major decision? Of course—“that was a decision that has affected all mankind and particularly all of us who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Each youth, indeed all of us, have the responsibility to make vitally important decisions.”</p>
<p>We learn through latter-day revelation about the War in Heaven and how Lucifer’s plan was to take away our agency and to force all of us to follow him. Upon his and everyone’s return, he wanted all the glory and all that the Father has to be his. But according to Heavenly Father’s plan carried out by the Savior’s, all of God’s children were given agency to make their own choices that would allow us to learn and to grow. Christ would come and atone for our sins and allow us the opportunity to repent and to be clean again. The scripture in Moses 4:1-3 tells us that Lucifer presented his plan to the Father, and I quote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</p>
<p>But our Elder Brother said: Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</p>
<p>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down.<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Father’s plan, championed by Jesus Christ, agency was integral. In fact, Lucifer’s plan could not have worked. Learning to exercise agency is the very essence of learning to be like our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>Here are two quotations that are very helpful to us when we are making critically important decisions in our lives. We must always remember that the opposing forces will always place doubts in our minds when we make important life decisions. Lucifer’s plan is to frustrate our Father’s plan and to convince all His children to follow him instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson stated,</p>
<p>”In Lewis Carroll’s classic Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Alice finds herself coming to a crossroads with two paths before her, each stretching onward but in opposite directions. She is confronted by the Cheshire Cat, of whom she asks, “Which path shall I take?” The cat answers: “That depends where you want to go. If you do not know where you want to go, it doesn’t really matter which path you take!”1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Alice, each of you knows where you want to go. It does matter which way you go because the path you follow in this life leads to the path you will follow into the next. Our Heavenly Father has given each of us the power to think and reason and decide. Each of us has the responsibility to choose. You may ask, “Are decisions really that important?” I say to you, decisions determine destiny. You can’t make eternal decisions without eternal consequences. May I provide a simple formula by which you can measure the choices that confront you. It’s easy to remember: “You can’t be right by doing wrong; you can’t be wrong by doing right.” Courage is required to think right, choose right, and do right, for such a course will rarely, if ever, be the easiest to follow. Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is your goal, and self-discipline will surely be required if you are to achieve it. You are precious in the sight of your Heavenly Father. He hears your prayers. He extends to you His peace and His love. Stay close to Him and to His Son, and you will not walk alone.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>A BYU Provo Professor David V. Dearden has stated,</p>
<p>“Remember that no one can exercise your agency for you. The Lord certainly will not. Doing that would not allow us to accomplish what we are here to do. Doing that wouldn’t teach us the things we must learn. As Oliver Cowdery learned when attempting to translate, we need to make the best decision we can before we ask the Lord if it is right:</p>
<p>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</p>
<p>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>When we do ask, I believe the most common answer for one who is living the gospel and is already tuned to the Spirit will likely be “You decide.” The Lord does not tell us this because He does not care or does not want to help. He does not tell us precisely because He does care and He does love us. It blesses us to learn to use our agency on our own. That is why we are here."<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>To my fellow students please consider these six very important questions now as you make your decision for the future. They are equally important and please involve the Lord as you decide on these questions. Remember when the Lord reminded Oliver Cowdery that you must study them out in your mind then ask if is right. You have great resources on this campus to help you as you make decisions about these questions. I know that they are very important for you and your future family and especially your progress in the kingdom. Remember that the Lord would not give us any commandments without preparing the way that we can accomplish them.</p>
<p>What major and career should I choose?</p>
<p>Should I serve a mission?</p>
<p>Whom should I date?</p>
<p>Whom should I marry?</p>
<p>When should we begin a family?</p>
<p>How can I have faith in our leaders and endure to the End?<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>When I look back on the choices made by my forefathers, I am grateful to those on both my mother’s and father’s sides, for their faith and courage many years ago to make right choices when making major life decisions. Their choices have affected my relatives all the way down to my own family today. Joining the church in Tonga was not the popular thing to do since their forefathers were strong in their own faith. I thank them for being strong in their faith and having the courage to make change. Both of my grandparents were very instrumental with the establishment of the LDS Church on our small island of Vava’u. My grandparents from my mother’s side (Langi) and father’s side (Unga) have 12 living children and they were all born and raised in the church. Many children were born into both families. Many of my uncles and aunties served missions as couples and majority of the 24 children were sealed in the temples included both of my grandparents. Majority of my first cousins and their children have also served fulltime missions.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to my parents for making right choices that blessed our family when I was young. My parents accepted the call to serve as branch president in the island of Ha’ano in the Ha’apai island Group. Like many couples serving there at the time, they were penniless but they had faith that their call was from God. They made new friends and brought new members into the fold. Their needs were taken care of by the goodness and hospitality of the people of Ha’ano. I know my parents love the missionary program of this church because as a young boy growing up, we always had the missionaries living with us at our home. I remember every Monday evening, our family with the help of our nonmember neighbors, prepared meals for 20 missionaries in the area. I am eternally grateful that I grew up in a home where the missionaries were present because they were great examples to me and I wanted to be like them. Consequently, later on in life, I was blessed with opportunity to serve in the California San Jose Mission. Two of my sisters and a younger brother served fulltime missions. My parents also made the sacrifice to raise funds to take their small family to the temple. They sold all their belongings and made loans to make the trip to New Zealand in 1959. With their two children, they were sealed in the New Zealand temple to become an eternal family, and in January 1963 our mother was taken home to our Heavenly Father. Though that was not my choice, I know that was my Heavenly Father’s will and plan, and I am looking forward for that happy reunion.</p>
<p>I was also blessed to have another mother in my life and six more brothers and sisters. In 1979, our family moved and resided in this community of Laie. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to have lived in this community and have had the blessing to gain an education from this University. To all my teachers especially my ELI teachers, Sister Alice Pack, Boyer and Lynn Hansen, thank you for having patience with me. It took me a while to finally complete the program, and I could not have done it without your encouragement and patience. To the rest of my professors and staff members, thank you for having a strong testimony of the divinity of God the father and his son Jesus Christ and the restored gospel. Personally I think that is a major reason why we should encourage our young people to attend this University. The environment and the spirit here is a major building ground for those who are making important choices and decisions for their futures. Additionally, we have the temple close by. What an ideal set up to live, gain an education, work and to worship all within walking distance. Living in this country and enjoying the blessings of the gospel is a wonderful blessing. We enjoy the freedom to choose and worship according to the dictates of our own conscience. My family and I have lived in the communities of Laie and Hauula for the last forty years and have enjoyed the blessing of working in this University. Our four children have attended BYU-Hawaii, with three graduated and one more to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To our students, you have made the right choice to attend this university. I hope you know how blessed you are to receive your education in this university. You will meet students with same values and high moral standards who will help you as you make important life decisions. This is the Lord’s university with capable leadership at the helm and under the direction of the Lord. I hope that you appreciate the education both spiritual and temporal you receive here. This is truly a special place. Learn all that you can and take that knowledge and testimony and share it with all God’s children.</p>
<p>My wife and I are both employed by this university and have been very fortunate to work with young people from different parts of the world. I feel that Lord has brought all us together to help and learn from each other. Faculty and staff, I hope we know the influence we have on these young people. Let us all try our best to help them while they are here. Some of these students are away from home and we might be the only role model they can follow. Be a good example in both word and deed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters may we always choose the right. Choose to be humble and to be teachable. Choose to be honest. Choose to live a clean and an exemplary life. Choose to repent daily or when needed. Choose to be forgiving. Choose to be kind, and above all, choose to love God with all your heart, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor. We will fulfill the prophecy made by President McKay at the Groundbreaking Services Church College of Hawaii/ BYU–Hawaii dedication February 12, 1955 and I quote:</p>
<p>“You mark that word, and from this school, I’ll tell you, will go men and women whose influence will be felt for good towards the establishment of peace internationally… You prepare to go and carry that message to all the nations of the earth.”<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Also as a reminder to all of us of our duty as members of the church to exercise our right to vote in this election year. Vote for the best person for the job. It is our responsibility to decide whom we want to represent our voice and ideals in the government. When we don’t vote, we allow bad leaders to be put into in leadership. May I remind all of us to get involved and vote. It is our duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In closing let me quote from Joshua 24:15 and also leave with you my testimony.</p>
<p>15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>I know that our Heavenly Father lives and he loves all his children. Jesus Christ is our Savior and he died that we may live again with our families. Joseph Smith through Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is the revealer of truths in this last dispensation. The Book of Mormon is the second testament of Jesus Christ and Thomas S Monson is the Lord’s prophet upon the earth today. Let us choose the right in our daily choices and decisions for they surely determine our destiny - In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Aloha Brothers and Sisters,</p>
<p>O my goodness, if it’s not bad enough standing in front of you today, I have to do it following General Conference! I apologize in advance for that.</p>
<p>Just a reminder from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland here, I hope I don’t drop you down too far from your highs of this past weekend and that you’ll remember the wonderful feelings of the General Conference messages you heard in spite of me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was five years old many eons ago, I remember watching a scene where my Tutu, my great grandmother, was chasing my older cousins around the house with a broom. She was very upset and they were running away from her laughing. Even as a child I remember feeling sad about that scene and thinking “that’s not right.” And my Tutu would yell out to them, “Ma hope ‘oe ‘ike.”</p>
<p>I’d heard my mother and grandmother say it often enough as I grew older that I had to find out the meaning: &nbsp; “Ma hope ‘oe ike. Bum by, you’ll see.” In other words, what goes around, comes around. I tried very hard to be really nice to my parents in hopes that someday I would have children and grandchildren and they in turn would be very nice to me.</p>
<p>My little grandmother gave birth to 17 children. My husband’s little grandmother gave birth to 21 children. My husband is one of nine children, but I’m only one of four. I had so much fun growing up with cousins all around though, that I wanted to have a large family so the kids would always have someone to play with. I was aiming for 17 but I thought 12 was a great number, and because there are only 12, I get to have their pictures in a clock on my kitchen wall. I am so happy to have eight, nine, and ten o’clock here with me today.</p>
<p>I love this scripture found in John 4:19 &amp; 21. "We love him, because he first loved us. . . And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Although I’m no Saint, I really do try to love everyone I meet. Some are so easy to love while others may take a little extra work on my part. But my mother loved me first and taught me a lot. One great lesson I learned during my senior year in high school. I was attending a private school in Honolulu and because I was a boarding student I didn’t have the opportunity to attend church or Seminary or Mutual like the other kids in my ward. I wasn’t even allowed to go home on weekends. However, I did have mini cottage meetings in my room whenever I could and was able to share my love of the gospel with some of my friends, a few of whom later joined the Church.</p>
<p>But there was a boy in my home ward—his name was BBIIIIIGGGG MIKE. He was called Big Mike for a reason. He was a very, very, big guy. Big Mike was a friend and we would talk now and then, but certainly nothing that would warrant “dating”. He wasn’t my type. Then one day, one of the girls in the ward told me that she heard Big Mike was going to ask me to his junior prom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What? No way . . . there is no way I would go with him so he better not ask,” I said. Big Mike was a nice guy, but definitely not someone I wanted to go out with, let alone go to a prom with where everyone would see us together.</p>
<p>I really don’t remember if I told my mother or not, but she found out anyway (mothers are like that) and asked me if I was going to the prom with Michael. “Of course not,” I said. “Are you kidding me? I hope he doesn’t ask me because I don’t want to have to hurt his feelings.”</p>
<p>I remember my mother looked at me and said: “Who do you think you are? Why, there are boys out there who would think the same thing of you!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What? Really? There is someone out there who wouldn’t want to go out with me?” That was an eye opener. How vain and shallow was I?</p>
<p>I still hoped he wouldn’t ask me to his prom, but silly boy, he did. And even sillier, with my mom’s words still ringing loudly in my mind, I went with him to his high school prom. Although he wasn’t my Prince Charming, I thought to myself that everyone would look at him and say, “Wow, he is such a lucky guy! How did he get her for a date?” Did I mention I was vain and shallow at that age?</p>
<p>But you know what? We had a great time—more fun than I ever expected. He had a really nice car (which didn’t hurt); and he had very good taste in flower leis (pikake, my favorite), and he took me to a very nice place for dinner. We had so much fun at the prom—meeting up with lots of my former classmates, and even went mini-golfing afterwards still all dressed up in our prom clothes. We laughed a lot that night and I thought, “whew, that wasn’t so bad after all”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years later, Big Mike and I had occasion to visit with each other. At the end of our conversation, he said to me, “You know, you’ll never know how much that meant to me, that you would say yes when I asked you to my prom. Everyone said don’t ask her, she won’t go with YOU. But you said yes and you made me so happy. Thank you for that.” I remember thinking right after we talked: thank you Mom and thank you Heavenly Father. About a year later, Big Mike was killed in a car accident. I am incredibly grateful that, instead of following my shallow and vain thoughts I followed my mom’s advice. Instead of being a disappointment and a regret for me, I got to be a positive and happy memory for Big Mike in his short life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of the poem that President Monson shared in his April 2014 conference address:</p>
<p>I have wept in the night</p>
<p>For the shortness of sight</p>
<p>That to somebody’s need made me blind;</p>
<p>But I never have yet</p>
<p>Felt a tinge of regret</p>
<p>For being a little too kind.<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>No, you can never be sorry for being too kind and it’s even more important to be kind than to be right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson, in that same talk also explained:</p>
<p>"We cannot truly love God if we do not love our fellow travelers on this mortal journey. Likewise, we cannot fully love our fellowmen if we do not love God, the Father of us all. Love is the very essence of the gospel, and Jesus Christ is our Exemplar. His life was a legacy of love."</p>
<p>Yes Jesus Christ was our example, and as I travel on my mortal journey, I can see this love of God through the actions of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father was raised on the island of Moloka’i as a Catholic. Unfortunately, as an altar boy, he acquired the taste of alcohol at a very early age. That never stopped him from being a hard worker and providing for his family though. We grew up in Kaneohe where he worked for Board of Water Supply. He was a very good employee and always showed up for work. He started at 7:00 am and was home by 4:00 pm, but &nbsp;if he wasn’t home by 4:30 pm, we knew he wasn’t coming home sober. I remember sometimes cringing in my bed and pretending I was asleep, because when he came home late, he always wanted company in the kitchen. He would always yell out for one of us kids to come and sit with him—that kid was usually me. I would have to listen to him talk nonsense and pretend I was falling asleep so he would either tell me to go back to bed, or he would fall asleep too. What we kids didn’t want for sure was for my mom to get up and start arguing with him. That usually didn’t end very well at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were many awful nights we had to endure at home. At those times we would ask my mom, “Why don’t you just leave him already?” My mom would remind us, “He’s a good man. He just has this weakness.” She saw a great man in my dad. It just took a lot longer for my dad to see it in himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our bishop at the time was also a police Sergeant and for whatever reason, he was the only one my dad would listen to when he was drunk and belligerent. Bishop Sam had a way of calming my dad down. Because he loved my dad first, my dad loved him. There wasn’t anything my dad wouldn’t do for Bishop Sam, except stop drinking and smoking. Although not what you would consider “active,” my dad would always be the first at the chapel for clean-up. He would even take his lawn mower to the chapel when no one else was there and clean the yard if he thought it wasn’t good enough. Mom saw the diamond in the rough. She loved him first and taught me to do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dad worked very hard to try and take us to the temple. However, he died from liver cancer before he was able to do that. Thank goodness for the temple and the work that goes on in there. We did his work a year later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A story is told of an interview with twins who had been raised by an alcoholic father. One grew up to be an alcoholic while the other one never touched the stuff. When asked the same question, “Why did you turn out the way you did?” both answered the same way, “With a father like mine, what did you expect?”</p>
<p>I decided at an early age that I did not want alcohol in my home. In spite of my father, no BECAUSE of my father, I chose a different life for my children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a wonderful sister in our ward who loved us first. She is Mom to some, Aunty Lavern to others, or Tutu to most of the kids in the ward and our street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because her husband was a fisherman, every summer at ward camp you would find Aunty Lavern sitting on the beach cleaning fish for others to eat. No complaints—just &nbsp;scaling, and gutting the fish and finally frying it all for the final luau on the last night of camp. But the thing I noticed was she did it all by herself. I also noticed that everyone loved to eat the fish she cleaned and fried but there were not many helping hands when it came to cleaning the fish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my children got older at ward camp and could look after themselves more I started cleaning fish with Aunty. After all, my dad was a fisherman, too. She still does it to this day, even from her wheelchair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because she loved us first, there isn’t anyone I know that wouldn’t do anything that Aunty wants or needs doing. One of Aunty’s favorite sayings is “many hands make light work” and I’m glad to say that many more hands have been added to fish detail at ward camp.</p>
<p>Wards are like family. Our Ward is even more than family at times.</p>
<p>Alma, in talking to his people, admonished them:</p>
<p>and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;</p>
<p>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life—</p>
<p>What a wonderful promise—just do these little things and ye shall have eternal life. I have been a beneficiary of those who were willing to bear my burden and mourn with me and comfort me, even until death.</p>
<p>When I was 13, I remember visiting family on the Big Island. The kids there loved to sing all the time. I heard a song then that touched my heartstrings, that I never forgot—little knowing at the time how it would impact me later on in life.</p>
<p>Mama, mama, you are tired, I know</p>
<p>Watching over me night and day</p>
<p>Soon you’ll rest for I must go I know</p>
<p>I must die, I heard them say.</p>
<p>All the tears roll down your pretty face</p>
<p>Mama, mama do not weep</p>
<p>Heaven is such a lovely place</p>
<p>Kiss me as I fall asleep.</p>
<p>Years later, it was like my Pokaiaua was singing this song to me. After almost a year of being ill, my 3 o’clock, was finally rightfully diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. He was nearly seven years old. He needed so much care and attention, but I had other little children to tend to. But with the help of family and friends and ward members, my burden was lightened; I was comforted, I could feel their love and support &nbsp;And in spite of that trial, I truly felt the Lord’s loving arms around me. He gave me strength I had no idea I possessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a year of treatment, everything seemed to be going very well, and I had another baby on the way. Then a few months before that baby was to arrive, we realized that it wasn’t going as well as we thought. I could see that he was tired of all the treatments but there was one more surgery that the doctors said would give us an extra six months with him. Only a mother would grasp at this very desperate straw. The thought that my child would precede me, the parent, in death was not the way life was supposed to be.</p>
<p>I remember how we got to take him home for the weekend. I was to convince him to have the surgery. With the World Series on TV in the background and us lying on my bed, I said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pokaiaua, the doctors want to do one more surgery so you can stay with us longer. Will that be all right?”</p>
<p>By this time, he had been baptized only a month. I could see how tired he was. But he looked at me so grown-up like and said, “I want to go home.”</p>
<p>I said, “But you are home!”</p>
<p>He replied, “Not this home.”</p>
<p>I cried and asked him to please have the surgery, and he looked at me through his little man eyes and with a tolerant smile on his face said, “Okay.” And suddenly, he was my senior.</p>
<p>If I had known then what I knew later, I wouldn’t have done the surgery. We didn’t have six more months with him at all—we only had six weeks, but six weeks of him in a coma. I was expecting another baby at the time, 7 o’clock, and the doctors said as soon as I delivered her, I could take him home.</p>
<p>Because we loved him first, Pokaiaua loved us enough to wait for his little sister to come down for her turn on earth before he headed home. I thought for sure they would high five each other, her spirit on her way down and his spirit on his way up. We named her “Kealohakamakanaoklani” – beloved gift from heaven. She was a gift Heavenly Father was sending to ease the pain. She was ten days old when he gently woke us up as his spirit left his body. And because I had just recently seen the play MY TURN ON EARTH, his eulogy was written through the eyes of his baby sister.</p>
<p>The Lord through his love, and His kind and tender mercy, puts wonderful people in our lives at the times when we need them the most, to love us very much.</p>
<p>I remember thinking, years later after the heartache had healed, that I had passed that test. I learned a great lesson and will render that same kind of love and service to others that was given to me. Ma hope ‘oe ‘ike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But alas and alack, I guess I didn’t learn enough. My eldest daughter,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leah, (two o’clock) was called to serve in the Japan Sendai mission. She was so excited and had prepared herself to serve the Lord because she loved our Savior very much. While in the MTC in Provo, she was having difficulty with the high altitude, so she thought. She was anemic, just like her mom, so she thought. But six weeks into the MTC, they found out it had nothing at all to do with the altitude—she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.</p>
<p>Again, I could look back and see the Lord’s great love and tender mercy. Somehow, no one knows how, but when she submitted her mission papers, her blood test was missing but no one noticed. That allowed her to receive her mission call and to spend six wonderful weeks in the MTC—six weeks that would shore her up for the next 18 months of her life. For those 18 months she loved all the doctors and nurses she came in contact with, and they in turn loved her.</p>
<p>But despite the trial my daughter was going through at the time, I could feel my Savior’s love for me and for my family—feelings (not the circumstances) that you wish would stay with you forever. I know with a surety that my daughter is happy and busy on the other side of the veil. Because He loved us first, we love Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the last few General Conferences have stressed the need to love one another; to be kind to each other; to forgive one another. President Monson has said:</p>
<p>"There are many attributes which are manifestations of love, such as kindness, patience, selflessness, understanding, and forgiveness. In all our associations, these and other such attributes will help make evident the love in our hearts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we not feel what the Savior wants us to feel when we sing Hymn #172:</p>
<p>Fill our hearts with sweet forgiving</p>
<p>Teach us tolerance and love,</p>
<p>Let our prayers find access to thee</p>
<p>In thy holy courts above</p>
<p>Then when we have proven worthy</p>
<p>Of thy sacrifice divine,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lord, let us regain thy presence,</p>
<p>Let thy glory round us shine.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Let me share a story of love being manifested through the kindness, forgiveness and helping hands of others. Many years ago, a friend of mine was on a stake presidency. It was at a time when the stake presidency needed to be reorganized and when only the first presidency or one of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles could perform that sacred duty.</p>
<p>Elder James E. Faust was the presiding authority for that stake conference. It was and still is I believe, a normal practice to interview Melchizedek priesthood holders to get a feel of who the next stake president should be. After interviewing many, it was my friends turn for an interview. As he sat down, Elder Faust looked him in the eye and said: “Everyone loves you. Everyone wants you to be the next stake president. But this isn’t a popularity contest, The Lord doesn’t work that way—and the Lord doesn’t want you, why?”</p>
<p>At that moment my friend said he realized two things: that The Church really was true and that the Lord really did speak to his Apostles. My friend finally came clean with his life. He had not been living worthy of his priesthood. He was excommunicated and left to the buffetings of Satan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1994, at the close of General Conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley reminded us that:</p>
<p>"There are those who were once warm in the faith, but whose faith has grown cold. Many of them wish to come back but do not know quite how to do it. They need friendly hands reaching out to them. With a little effort, many of them can be brought back to feast again at the table of the Lord."<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Many hearts were broken and many hearts were unforgiving, but the Lord loved him and did not forget him. Years later, a sweet sister missionary loved him first. She and her companion persistently visited him every week. When it was time for her transfer, a missionary couple, with warm, friendly hands reaching out to him, withholding judgment, loving him despite of his shortcomings, loved him back into the fold. He rejoiced in the atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ. He was re-baptized, and attended his meetings, patiently accepting and doing whatever the bishop required of him. Through patience and long-suffering and through the love of many, his long awaited temple blessings were finally restored; families were united once more, and my friend rejoiced in the few temple sessions he was able to attend before he passed away. President Uchtdorf reminds us that:</p>
<p>Our willingness to repent shows our gratitude for God’s gift and for the Savior’s love and sacrifice on our behalf. Commandments and priesthood covenants provide a test of faith, obedience, and love for God and Jesus Christ, but even more importantly, they offer an opportunity to experience love from God and to receive a full measure of joy both in this life and in the life to come. . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember: the heavens will not be filled with those who never made mistakes but with those who recognized that they were off course and who corrected their ways to get back in the light of gospel truth.</p>
<p>In closing, I echo President Hinckley when he said: &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Brothers and Sisters, I would hope, I would pray, that each of us, . . . would resolve to seek those who need help, who are in desperate and difficult circumstances, and lift them in the spirit of love into the embrace of the Church, where strong hands and loving hearts will warm them, comfort them, sustain them,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because He loved us first, may we in turn love one another, ma hope ‘oe ‘ike . . . is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>27 September 2016<br />Elder Scott D. Whiting<br />Area President of the Asia North Area<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, Aloha! As my wife mentioned, it is truly a blessing for us to return to our beloved Hawaii. This is where we raised our children; this is where we learned so very much about Christ-like service; this is where our hearts will forever be.</p>
<p>I need to express to you how much we love President and Sister Tanner. We fully support them in this assignment and truly enjoy our association with them whether it be in Japan, Korea, or the islands of the sea. You are blessed to be led by them and I commend them to you as wonderful examples and role models after which you can safely and happily pattern your own lives.</p>
<p>Now my dear young brothers and sisters, as I prepared my remarks for you today, I felt impressed to speak to you plainly. I think that you deserve that as God’s elect living in a world of increasing moral confusion and wickedness. In order to do so, please let me start with a simple experience from my childhood.</p>
<p>When I was a young boy, we didn’t have video games or other forms of electronic entertainment with the exception of a television that broadcast all of four channels, a radio and a turntable for vinyl records. This is not a complaint. When you don’t know what technological advancements lie ahead, you don’t lament not having them. There is a certain peace about that reality.</p>
<p>Because of this seemingly “backward” time in history, as children we played outside every chance we could. We would play in the neighborhood and occasionally travel to a public park to play on the vast array of playground equipment—a metal slide, swings, metal climbing structure and the ever popular human-powered merry-go-round pictured here. To be honest, the merry-go-round was not something that I enjoyed. I would watch kids playing on it laughing and having a good time and every now and again, I would give it a go only to end up feeling sick, dizzy and miserable. To me the merry-go-round was a cruel invention. The only way that I could even remotely “enjoy” the merry-go-round was if I were to stand in the middle as it spun and constantly adjust my footing so that I could keep my eyes fixed on a certain object. The moment that I stopped looking at that object, I would quickly become disoriented, dizzy and nauseated. My wife, who danced ballet for many years before we were married, tells me that ballet dancers do the same thing when they perform their many elegant pirouettes. It is called spotting. Fixing your eyes on a single point in order to keep your balance and avoid the debilitating and disorienting effects of dizziness. To this day, I won’t get near a merry-go-round, yet my life feels rich and full.</p>
<p>As I think about this simple lesson learned in childhood, I find a deeper more meaningful application of this lesson in my life today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no secret that as we move closer to the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the world will continue to descend into greater wickedness. The day is approaching when “[the Lord’s] indignation is soon to be poured out without measure upon all nations; and this will [He] do when the cup of their iniquity is full.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> &nbsp; Indeed, we are living in the long prophesied last days of the world when the gap between the world and the Church of Jesus Christ is, perhaps, as wide as it has ever been. The cup of iniquity is fast reaching its full capacity. As we read the daily news reports from across the world, we see unspeakable acts of violence and moral degradation, the erosion of religious liberties and the systematic assault on the family in nations across the world. It is clear that the world is fast spinning out of control.</p>
<p>Just like the merry-go-round on the playground, this spinning of the world can cause us to lose our balance and become disoriented. In order to avoid these potentially devastating effects we need to keep our eyes fixed on a stationary object and adjust our footing as needed.</p>
<p>Blessedly, our loving Heavenly Father has provided us with a stationary object that is fixed, firm and unmoving. That object is His living prophet and apostles on the earth today. Notice that I did not pluralize the word “object” into “objects.” I purposely used the singular, because the living prophet and apostles are singular in their purpose and completely unified in their counsel and teachings. They are all prophets, seers and revelators. Accordingly, from here on I will refer to the prophet and apostles as simply “prophets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Guide to the Scriptures instruct that a prophet is, “a person who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God… A prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences. He is a preacher of righteousness. His primary responsibility, however, is to bear witness of Jesus Christ.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By this very definition, prophets are set at odds against an increasingly wicked world. This is not a situation unique to our times. The scriptures are filled with accounts of the wicked rejecting and even martyring God’s prophets. We cannot forget the great prophet Abinadi who had the courage to denounce the sins of King Noah and his people. He raised his voice to the people and spoke for God when he said, “And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage; and none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God. Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> You will remember that Abinadi taught them, “that salvation did not come by the law [of Moses] alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;He taught them the Ten Commandments;<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;how Christ is the Father and the Son;<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;that little children have eternal life;<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;that men can be redeemed from their fallen state; and, that there will be a resurrection.<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Plainly put, he taught them the gospel of Jesus Christ without excuse, apology, deviation, adaptation or concern for his personal well-being. He was, truly, a fixed object—steadfast and immoveable. We cannot forget that he, “sealed the truth of his words by his [fiery] death.”<a href="#FN9">9</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, the prophet Joseph Smith taught the restored gospel amid great trials and adversity. He was tarred and feathered, subjected to multiple criminal lawsuits (all without merit), he hid and fled from mobs and wicked men attempting to destroy him. In the end, he too, suffered a martyr’s fate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From these and many other examples in the scriptures, we understand that being a prophet has never been and most certainly is not a popularity contest. The prophet does not seek favored treatment or acceptance with every special interest group or individual representing current societal trends or self-proclaimed progressive movements as may be determined, created or otherwise made popular by the media or those using available digital venues. Prophets stand firm in the face of wickedness and denounce it when it rears its head. It has been so from the beginning, it is so today, and it will be so in the days to come. They are fixed objects. They are steadfast and immoveable by very definition.</p>
<p>In a great prophetic act in this modern day, prophets delivered to all mankind the clear and plain word of God known as “The Family: &nbsp;A Proclamation to the World.” &nbsp;This Proclamation was first publicly read by President Gordon B. Hinckley as part of his message at the General Relief Society Meeting held on September 23, 1995. Many of you were not even born when this was introduced to the world. To show you how much the world has changed in the past 21 years, I personally don’t recall any negative comments or public outcry over the doctrines stated therein. There may have been, but it did not dominate any news cycle or even receive much if any attention by the media. Certainly, the vast majority of members of the Church readily accepted the Proclamation and its contained truths as being just that—truths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two paragraphs read, “We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.”</p>
<p>“All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.”</p>
<p>As mentioned, these truths were given to us 21 years ago by the prophet. Simple, eternal truths that have been established from the beginning of time are now, in just a few short years, considered by some to be “out of touch,” “phobic,” and “mean spirited.” Just as Abinadi pointed out to King Noah: “Because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me.… Because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that I am mad”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;“or, as Elder Holland included in a recent talk, “we might add, provincial, patriarchal, bigoted, unkind, narrow, outmoded, and elderly.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> &nbsp; Critics claim that the Church should change its doctrines to keep pace with societal trends. I have a question for you. When has God or His Son Jesus Christ ever changed an eternal truth to conform to societal trends, or for any other reason for that matter? It is wholly inconsistent with the nature of God. God, just like his prophets, is steadfast and immoveable. The core doctrines of this Church existed before the foundations of the world. They are not made up by man, nor are they changeable by man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s remember the words of Moroni when he said, “For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing?</p>
<p>And now, if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth vary, and in whom there is shadow of changing, then have ye imagined up unto yourselves a god who is not a God of miracles.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball, a prophet, taught that, “There are absolute truths and relative truths.… There are many ideas advanced to the world that have been changed to meet the needs of the truth as it has been discovered. There are relative truths, and there are also absolute truths which are the same yesterday, today, and forever—never changing. These absolute truths are not altered by the opinions of men. As science has expanded our understanding of the physical world, certain accepted ideas of science have had to be abandoned in the interest of truth. Some of these seeming truths were stoutly maintained for centuries. The sincere searching of science often rests only on the threshold of truth, whereas revealed facts give us certain absolute truths as a beginning point so we may come to understand the nature of man and the purpose of his life.…</p>
<p>“We learn about these absolute truths by being taught by the Spirit. These truths are ‘independent’ in their spiritual sphere and are to be discovered spiritually, though they may be confirmed by experience and intellect. (See D&amp;C 93:30)</p>
<p>“God, our Heavenly Father—Elohim—lives. That is an absolute truth. … All the people on the earth might deny him and disbelieve, but he lives in spite of them. … In short, opinion alone has no power in the matter of an absolute truth. He still lives. And Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Almighty, the Creator, the Master of the only true way of life—the gospel of Jesus Christ. The intellectual may rationalize him out of existence and the unbeliever may scoff, but Christ still lives and guides the destinies of his people. That is an absolute truth; there is no gainsaying. …</p>
<p>“The Gods organized and gave life to man and placed him on the earth. This is absolute. It cannot be disproved. A million brilliant minds might conjecture otherwise, but it is still true.”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I recognize that just because something is a truth does not mean that it is easily understood or readily accepted even by the most faithful. As mortals we do not know the mind of God and at times His truths may conflict with our personal circumstances or deeply held feelings. The Adversary knows this and exploits this to his purposes. He places in the hearts of men doubt and perhaps even feelings of alienation from other truths that we readily accept. For those so struggling, I restate the counsel given by Elder Holland when he said, “this is a divine work in process, with the manifestations and blessings of it abounding in every direction, so please don’t hyperventilate if from time to time issues arise that need to be examined, understood, and resolved. They do and they will. In this Church, what we know will always trump what we do not know. And remember, in this world, everyone is to walk by faith.”<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the history of man, it has always been, and remains so today, that man is the one that needs to change in order to align himself with God not the other way around.</p>
<p>King Benjamin taught, “Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters.”<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there is Alma asking, “And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?”</p>
<p>It cannot be clearer! We must keep our eyes fixed on prophets and adjust and change our footing as the world spins around us in order to keep from becoming disoriented and losing our way. As we change, as we fix our eyes on prophets there is safety and peace.</p>
<p>Elder Ballard shared this observation. “I have discovered in my ministry that those who have become lost [and] confused are typically those who have most often … forgotten that when the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve speak with a united voice, it is the voice of the Lord for that time. The Lord reminds us, ‘Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same’.”<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find such peace and joy in that doctrine—“whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” How blessed we are to have a loving Heavenly Father that has provided us with the consistency of His word in these trying times!</p>
<p>As a husband and father I have found great peace in following the counsel of the prophet. While I am certainly not perfect in either role, I improve my performance by listening to and applying the counsel given by the prophet. For as long as I can remember, I have loved and revered the prophet. I was certainly taught to do so in my home by my parents. As my wife and I have raised our family, we have always prioritized the words of the prophet. We have not always been perfect in implementation, but we have tried our best. I have listened to their words. I have read their words and I have and do observe them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was called to be a young bishop here in Hawaii, I needed a new suit. As many of you may know, there are not many places in Hawaii where you can buy a suit. Anyway, my wife and I traveled to one such department store and I began trying on suits. One suit in particular drew a compliment from my wife when I tried it on. That was all I needed to hear and I was ready to buy it. However, as I looked more closely at the suit, I noticed that it had three buttons down the front. To that day, I did not recall ever seeing a prophet wear a three button suit, so I put the suit back on the rack and we left empty handed. A few weeks later, we received a copy of the Church News and there on the cover was President Hinckley standing in front of a recently dedicated temple. I studied the picture closely and discovered that he was wearing a three button suit. I ran to my wife and said, “Look at this picture!” She commented on the beauty of the new temple. I then focused her attention on President Hinckley’s suit and pointed out that it had three buttons. Well, the rest is history as I returned to the department store and bought a three button suit.</p>
<p>Now, I know that this sounds silly and a bit extreme. However, it was, and still is, important to me that I fix my eyes on prophets in all things. I was a bishop. I was representing the prophet to the beloved youth of my ward. I wanted them to see in me, what they saw in the prophet. I did not want to stand out as being different from him. I wanted them to see consistency and steadiness in their bishop. I don’t know if I succeeded in that quest, but I tried, even down to the suits that I wore.</p>
<p>I have found that the prophet will never ask us to do something that we unable to do. At times their counsel may require that we change our footing in order to align ourselves more fully with our Heavenly Father. At times, their counsel will require us to draw upon the cleansing and enabling power of the atonement of Jesus Christ. Drawing upon that power we can make the changes necessary to live with Heavenly Father again. I have also found, that if there is any difficulty in accepting their counsel it is usually because of my own weakness and pride.</p>
<p>I remember the story of Moses and the children of Israel as they wandered in the wilderness for those many years. I remember the serpents that tormented the people with their venomous bites. In the Old Testament we read, “And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us.’ And Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.’ &nbsp;And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That sounds easy enough, right? A deadly snake bites you, you look at a stick with a brass serpent affixed to it and you live. Don’t look at the stick and you die. Easy choice, right? Well, we learn from Alma, that it was not as easy as it might appear for some. Alma recounted the story to his people with more detail as follows,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live. But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them. O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish? If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.”<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma teaches us that the brass serpent he affixed to the pole was a type or symbol of Christ as he hung on the cross. So important is this lesson, that it is referenced four separate times in the Book of Mormon.<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>We fix our eyes on the prophet by sustaining him. What does that mean, exactly? We sustain the prophet by doing the following: &nbsp;First, we pray for him. We pray that he may have good health and strength and that he will be able to receive and deliver the word of God to us. Second, we listen to him and study his words. We will have the opportunity to listen this weekend, and then to study his words in the weeks following General Conference. And, third, we follow the prophet’s counsel. Exercise your faith. Call upon your Heavenly Father for help. Repent when you need to and change your footing to keep your eyes fixed upon him.</p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters, the prophet loves you. I have heard prophets petition heaven on your behalf. I have heard them speak countless times about you with great care and concern over your spiritual and temporal well-being. You are constantly in their thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this world continues to spin toward greater wickedness, erosion of religious liberties and rationalization against God’s fixed standard and those who proclaim it, I implore you to keep your eyes fixed on the prophet and to adjust and change your footing as may be required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I echo the words of one such prophet, Elder Ballard, when under apostolic authority he said, “I make you a promise. It’s a simple one, but it is true. If you will listen to the living prophet and the apostles and heed [their] counsel, you will not go astray.”<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear you my witness that this is true. I bear you my witness that this is the Church of Jesus Christ and that He stands at its head. I bear you my witness that Thomas S. Monson is, as a prophet of God, a fixed object. He is steadfast and immovable as are his counselors and the Twelve Apostles. I sustain them with all my heart. I bear you my witness that they will not lead you astray.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I bear you my witness that Jesus is the Christ. That He is the Son of God and that He lives! Of these absolute truths I bear my witness in His sacred name, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>20 September 2016<br />Lenard Huff<br />Professor of Business Management, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>When I was in high school, my best friend, Ron Cullimore and I often went to a hill above Burton Elementary School in my hometown of Kaysville, Utah. We called it Inspiration Point. It was a humble little hill, but from there you could gaze up at the stars and out towards the Great Salt Lake, Antelope Island and the Oquirrh Mountains. You could imagine a world beyond. From there, we talked about all sorts of things, but mostly dreamed and shared our hopes for the future. We each hoped to go on a mission, return to meet a wonderful girl, be married in the temple and have five children. It was always five children. For the most part, our hopes were fulfilled. Ron went on a mission, met and married Pat and had four (not quite five) children and now 15 grandchildren. I also went on a mission, met and married Bonnie, had those five children and now 13 grandchildren as of next month. Bonnie, I want you to know that you are the love of my life. I’ve loved sharing life’s journey with you. You are more than I ever hoped for as I lay there dreaming on Inspiration Point.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about hope. As a student and teacher of marketing, my interest in hope comes from one of my favorite quotes. When someone asked Charles Revson, founder of Revlon, what business he was in, he said, “In the factory we make cosmetics, but in the store, we sell hope.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>But hope goes much deeper than that. It is one of three Christian virtues, along with faith and charity, that qualify one for God’s work.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> These virtues are key characteristics of God, as well as gifts from God we are expected to nourish. By exercising faith, hope and charity, we both draw closer to God and become as He is. It has always been clear to me why faith and charity are included in this triad of virtues. In First Corinthians 13, Paul speaks of faith, hope and charity, but focuses on charity and declares it the greatest of the three. In Moroni 7, Mormon speaks of faith, hope and charity, but devotes most of his discourse to the power of faith. Hope seems sandwiched in the middle: acknowledged, but relatively forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Meaning of Hope</span></strong></p>
<p>So what is hope and why do the Lord and His prophets consider it such a fundamental part of both our earthly and eternal experience? &nbsp;Hope is both a noun and a verb. As a verb, “to hope” is the act of yearning or longing for a desired outcome that is uncertain, but considered possible. Regarding the uncertainty of hope, the Apostle Paul emphasized that “Hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We have both objects of hope and sources of hope. President Uchtdorf differentiates between things we hope for and things we hope in.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> We hope for such things as safety, health, wealth, beauty, love, marriage, peace, contentment, forgiveness, happiness, success, eternal life and getting an “A” on my midterm. Our hopes are based on the things we hope in, such as qualified doctors, modern medicine, the fruits of hard work, our own intelligence, the love of others, the priesthood, God’s love, Christ’s atonement and maybe the mercy of our professors.</p>
<p>We hope for ourselves and we hope for others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have little hopes and big hopes; short-term hopes, long-term hopes and medium-term hopes that lead to long-term hopes; temporal hopes and eternal hopes.</p>
<p>Hope gives meaning to life. When we lose hope, there is no reason to press forward. Hope’s bright flame motivates us to strive for a better life and a better world. Laini Taylor, writer of fantasy books for young people, put it beautifully: &nbsp;“Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic.”&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Do We Hope For?</span></strong></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, what do you hope for? &nbsp;I’m going to give you an assignment. I want you to think for a moment of the three things that right now in your life you most hope for. I’ll give you a few seconds. If possible, write them down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, reflect on your list and answer the following questions:</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>First, “What is the nature of my hopes?” &nbsp;Are they focused on me or on others? &nbsp;Are they near term, medium-term or long-term? &nbsp;Little or big? &nbsp;Temporal or eternal?</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Second, “How hopeful, or confident am I that the things I most hope for will actually happen?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Third, “What is my hope based on?” &nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Finally, “How do I feel when I reflect on my hopes? &nbsp;How strong is my longing or yearning?” &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stories of Hope</span></strong></p>
<p>I would love to talk with each of you about your most heart-felt hopes. But since I can’t share all of your hopes today, I would like to share some stories of hope.</p>
<p>I found several stories in just one issue, June 2016, of the Ensign:&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Ephrem, a boy from Ethiopia suffered hunger, lack of shelter, the loss of both parents, life in an orphanage, and an adopted family that fell apart. Through it all, his hope and faith sustained him. He was blessed with small miracles, including finding the Church and receiving a testimony of Christ. He eventually served a mission in Texas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Andrew, a deacon with a rare disease called Friedreich’s ataxia that affects his balance and coordination, hoped to pass the sacrament. His hope was fulfilled with the help of his gentle father who steadied Andrew’s frail and wavering body against his arm and helped him hold the sacrament tray.</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>John long hoped to find a woman he could marry in the temple. His hope was sustained by knowing that Heavenly Father loves him and has a plan for him. He finally found true love and married in the temple at the age of 42.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>David struggled with ADHD. As a teenager, he attempted suicide and moved away from home. Homeless and without hope, he reached out to God in prayer, then found the Church and was baptized. Sometime later, David received proper treatment for his ADHD. His bishop recommended that he enroll in the Pathway program, which started the path to an exciting career in software engineering. &nbsp;As he explained, “I discovered feelings of peace and hope that I had never before experienced. I hadn’t even known it was possible to obtain feelings of peace and hope of this magnitude.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In an article entitled, “Learning to Hope” in the August 2007 edition of the Liahona, Mariama Kallon described unspeakable horrors that she and her family experienced at the hands of Civil War rebels in Sierre Leone, in Africa. Once, when her health and safety were in desperate peril, she said a silent, pleading prayer and was saved by a miracle. Eventually, Mariama found and joined the Church, which provided her with food, a blanket and a hygiene kit. The food kept her alive. When rebels burned down the homes in her town, she shared her hygiene kit with others. The blanket sheltered her and others for several days until she used it to wrap an old woman who had died and had nothing to be buried in. Eventually, Miariama was called to the Salt Lake City Temple Square Mission. When she took a tour of the Church’s Humanitarian Center, she recognized blankets, food and hygiene kits like those she had received. “This is where they came from!” she thought to herself. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she remembered how these things brought her hope during very trying times in Sierra Leone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories from Church magazines are inspiring, but inspiring stories of hope are all around us. Recently, I talked with my colleague, Erin Frederick who last Spring shattered her tibia, the bone just below the knee. Always active, Erin suddenly couldn’t walk. True to her determined spirit, she came to work as soon as she was able, teaching in a wheelchair. During the days of final exams, she suffered an embolism, or blood clot that nearly killed her. After recovering from that, she was determined to do all in her power to help herself heal. She yearns for the day when she will again hike in the mountains. With her determination, fed by hope, I am confident she will.</p>
<p>But this isn’t even half of Erin’s story of hope. About nine years ago, her husband Matt suffered a massive stroke at age 47. Before his stroke, Matt was intelligent, successful, engaging and healthy. After the stroke, doctors doubted he would live. When he survived, they predicted he would never be able to read. Erin and her family were devastated, but neither they nor Matt lost hope. Recovery was painfully slow, yet largely through the help and love of others, small miracles helped Matt progress. To show his love and support, Clayton Hubner, former faculty member at BYU-Hawaii, and a long-time friend of the Fredericks, called Matt about every two weeks, carrying on a somewhat one-way conversation since Matt couldn’t respond. Sometime during their first two years in Hawaii, Matt’s brother-in-law came to visit. While here, he read a simple novel and offered to read it out loud to Matt. He left the book with Matt and challenged him to read it. This small act of love sparked a ray of hope in Matt, who had been a voracious reader before his stroke. For two months, Matt read the first two pages over and over again. Gradually, he could read more. Eight months later he proudly pronounced that he had finished the book. Since then, Matt has made remarkable progress. He recently traveled alone to the mainland, navigating two separate flight changes and finding and checking himself into a hotel. He is now a frequent guest speaker at the University of Hawaii Medical School, where he tells his story of recovery, using a Powerpoint presentation he prepared himself, and fields questions from the audience. After years of depending on Erin and others to fulfill his hopes, he now provides hope to Erin, who hopes to join him on his hikes in the mountains near their home. Erin admitted that Matt will never be everything he was before the stroke, but in many ways, he is much more. What they have gone through has not been easy. There have been times when all they had to cling to was hope. But Erin treasures how she and Matt have grown in ways they never could have experienced if it weren’t for the stroke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, too, have had many personal experiences with hope. As a senior at BYU-Provo, I was filled with hope. I met Bonnie and knew immediately she was the one I wanted to marry. This was confirmed through several powerful spiritual experiences. It took a few months, but on New Year’s Eve I closed the deal when she said “yes”. On May 7, we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. I was also accepted into Harvard’s MBA program. Two of my fondest hopes were fulfilled. We loved our time in the Boston area and I earned my MBA, but had a hard time finding the type of job I hoped for. I found one in Salt Lake City, but it really wasn’t a good fit and I was never happy there. After 18 months, I lost my job, with a wife and two small children to provide for. This was a huge blow to my confidence, but I never lost hope. During the following ten years, many aspects of life were great. I had a wonderful wife, for whom I thanked the Lord every day. We added two children, loved serving in the Princeton Ward and lived near family and lifelong friends. However, the hopes I had for my career were not being met.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this time, I taught on the side at the University of Phoenix and then the University of Utah. I enjoyed teaching and considered making a career of it. That meant going back to school to get a PhD. I talked with professors and administrators at Weber State University and the University of Utah, who gave mixed advice. I asked Craig Sudbury, a member of our stake presidency, to give me a blessing that I might know what to do. Bro. Sudbury started the blessing somewhat haltingly, but the Spirit suddenly kicked in with promises for what was in store if I pursued the PhD. It was like having a second patriarchal blessing.</p>
<p>With the hope this blessing gave me, I applied to six PhD programs. I particularly hoped the University of Michigan would accept me. It was the highest rated program on my list and located in a college town we thought would be good for our family. Two universities immediately accepted me, the most promising of which was the University of Washington in Seattle. However, weeks passed and I heard nothing from the University of Michigan. Thinking the University of Washington was going to be our best opportunity, Bonnie and I flew to Seattle at our own expense to see how we felt about it. Surprisingly, we didn’t feel good at all. We returned to Salt Lake City confused and discouraged. Then literally one day after returning, Claes Fornell, chair of the PhD program at the University of Michigan’s Graduate School of Business, called and invited me to attend their program. When I told Bonnie the news, we both knew that the University of Michigan was where we were supposed to be. At age 38, with four children, we made the huge leap of faith to leave our home in Salt Lake and be poor college students for at least four years, all based on the hope that our life would be richer for it. Things went very well at Michigan. After graduating, I joined the faculty at the University of Hawaii, which led us to BYU-Hawaii, the place we needed to be, both for my career and my family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the stories of hope have had happy endings. But what about times when what we most hope for isn’t fulfilled, such as the experience of our good friend, Pam Palmer, and her husband, Mike. Mike was a BYU-Hawaii faculty member when he was stricken with cancer. As with most cancer patients, Mike and his family hoped to beat it. Shortly after he was diagnosed, Mike gave Pam a blessing in which he blessed her that she and her children would not be left without his support through the next 40 years. Pam feels that this blessing gave Mike hope that he would recover, even when doctors gave him little or no hope. Many blamed Mike and Pam for giving their children false hope. Mike and Pam knew that the chances for recovery were slim, but they reasoned that living with hope was better than living without it. As author Marian Zimmer Bradley wrote: “The road that is built in hope is more pleasant to the traveler than the road built in despair, even though they both lead to the same destination.” The Palmers chose the road of hope. When things looked especially grim, Mike received a blessing from Dallin Oaks and Jeffrey Holland, who were visiting Hawaii at the time. In their blessing, they assured Mike that it was right to hope for recovery, that this temporal life is a blessing worth fighting for. On the other hand, they made very clear that Mike’s hope extended beyond this life. Not long after, Mike passed away, leaving Pam alone to care for their six children. In the end, Mike wasn’t there physically to support the children and Pam, but they often felt his presence, reaching out to support them from the other side of the veil.</p>
<p>One of the most spiritual experiences of my life occurred when my Mom was first diagnosed with cancer. As anyone who knew her would attest, my Mom was one of the most vibrant, loving, selfless persons on earth. If anyone deserved to live, and would have the will to live, it was Mom. We were all hopeful she would beat the cancer. I went to the hospital to see her and give her a blessing. I fully expected to bless her that she would overcome the cancer and be made whole. However, shortly after starting the blessing, I had an overwhelming feeling that many of Mom’s loved ones who had passed on were in the room, surrounding her with loving arms outstretched, welcoming her to their Heavenly home. I knew instantly that Mom wouldn’t survive the cancer, but would be welcomed home when she died. I didn’t share this experience with anyone except maybe Bonnie until after Mom passed away. I didn’t want to discourage anyone from having hope and sharing their hope with Mom. My Aunt Lucy, who was a nurse, and my Grandma Jones were particular sources of hope. Their hope that she would continue to live in this life wasn’t granted, but we all knew that Mom had hope for a better life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What These Stories Teach Us About Hope</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;These stories illustrate three elements of hope that make it such a beautiful and critical Christian virtue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>First, when we hope we yearn or long for something that we desire, but don’t now have. This yearning or longing inspires us to act. Peter speaks of a lively hope.<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> Paul admonishes us to “show … diligence to the full assurance of hope”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> and to “plow in hope”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>. Hoping for something inspires us to dig a little deeper and work a little harder to make our hopes come true.</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Second, because there is some level of uncertainty and because we often don’t have full control over the outcome, we generally must depend on others, including God, to fulfill our hopes. Relying on others requires meekness. As Mormon says in Moroni 7:43: &nbsp;“And again, I say unto you that a man cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek and lowly of heart.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Finally, when we have hope, we have some degree of belief that the desired outcome will happen. This belief brightens our lives, lightens our load and gives us the strength to carry on. As Scottish writer Samuel Smiles wrote: &nbsp;“Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey towards it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us... It lends promise to the future and purpose to the past. It turns discouragement to determination.”</p>
<p>Even when hope seems dim, as it did with the Palmers, living with hope strengthens us and gives life purpose. In “Man’s Search for Meaning”, Victor Frankl reflects on prisoners’ efforts to survive the Nazi death camps of World War II. Frankl explains: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation—just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer—we are challenged to change ourselves.”</p>
<p>Returning to the three Christian virtues, how is hope related to faith and charity? &nbsp;Perhaps hope comes first. Our yearning ignites our desire to develop faith, but hope requires some degree of faith that desired outcomes will happen. We need something to “hope in”. According to Paul, “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup> Mormon asks, “How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall hope?” but then explains that “if a man have faith, he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup>&nbsp; Regarding charity, hope sparks the spiritual light necessary for Christ-like love, but as shown repeatedly in our stories, hope is nurtured through love. It seems clear, then, that faith, hope and charity are interdependent. You can’t have one without the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Can We Keep Hope Burning Brightly?</span></strong></p>
<p>Knowing that hope enriches our lives, what must we do to keep it burning brightly? &nbsp;Many, especially you students, are likely blazing with hope. If so, cherish and nurture it. And don’t be greedy. Share your hope and be a beacon of hope for others, like my old friends and new heroes, Kerry and Marianne Hopkin. A few years ago, while serving in the stake presidency of the Boston, Massachusetts stake, Kerry worked with the Haitian Branch. He took special interest in teenage brothers, Carlens and Hantzly Murat, whose school in Haiti had been destroyed by an earthquake. They were sent to live with relatives in Boston, but were basically left to fend for themselves, knowing very little English. Kerry and Marianne decided to take them in and become their surrogate parents. The Hopkins enrolled them in an excellent school, tutored them in school work and the English language, taught them life skills and the gospel, and kept them enrolled in seminary and church activities. Kerry got up every morning and drove them 10 miles from Needham to Boston so they could attend 6 a.m. seminary. Carlens is now serving in the Florida Tampa Mission and Hantzly in the Florida Ft. Lauderdale Mission. Since then, the Hopkins have taken in other Haitian children, giving them hope they probably never dreamed of.</p>
<p>But for many, hope has dimmed. Why is that? Remember that there are two essential properties of hope. First, we yearn for something we desire. Second, we have some belief that what we hope for may come true. If either our yearning or our belief diminish, hope diminishes. I offer three main reasons our yearning or belief may diminish:</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>First, the hard knocks of life just wear us down. We all have setbacks, often through no fault of our own, that try our faith in ourselves, others and God and diminish our hope.</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Second, sin diminishes both our faith and yearning for the blessings that come from righteousness.</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Finally, apathy. As Jeff Caneen described in his recent devotional address, our lives sometimes plateau. Many of our earlier hopes may have already come true. Some hopes may have simply faded away, and we can’t find the motivation to identify and work on new ones.</p>
<p>If your hopes have dimmed for any of these reasons, I encourage you to take inventory of your hopes. Decide what you hope for and then make those hopes come alive. I love this quote from American novelist, Barbara Kingsolver: &nbsp;“The very least you can do in your life is figure out what you hope for. And the most you can do is live inside that hope. Not admire it from a distance but live right in it, under its roof.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you nurture your hopes, take Alma’s metaphor of growing faith as your model.<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup> Look for even a kernel or ray of hope. If it is a righteous hope, your hope will grow if you plant it, cultivate it, fertilize it, water it. Think of what you need to do personally to make it grow. Seek help. Don’t forget to pray and seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Look for ways that you can be a source of hope for others. As you enliven hope in others, your own hope will grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Atonement of Christ: Ultimate Hope</span></strong></p>
<p>As you take inventory of your hopes, remember that there are temporal hopes and eternal hope, or as Neal Maxwell described, ultimate hope. Our temporal hopes are good. They keep us going, striving for a better life. They brighten our lives. But to live life to its fullest, our temporal hopes must be rooted in our ultimate hope for eternal life, made possible by the atonement of Christ. As Howard W. Hunter said, “Christ’s way is not only the right way, but ultimately the only way to hope and joy.”</p>
<p>Two verses from scripture powerfully summarize the role hope plays in our lives and the central role that Christ and Heavenly Father play in feeding our hope:</p>
<p>From Ether 12: 4: “Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2 Nephi 31:20. “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father, ye shall have eternal life.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>To close, please join me in singing the first verse of the hymn, “Press Forward Saints”.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Press forward Saints, with steadfast faith in Christ,</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>With hope’s bright flame alight in heart and mind;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>With love of God, and love of all mankind,</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah!<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>May hope’s flame shine brightly in the hearts and mind of all of us, I pray.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus, Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>13 September 2016<br />Rowena Reid<br />Academic Career Counselor, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, TALOFA LAVA!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to my family who are here with me today—grateful that my mom can be here, my sisters, my uncles and aunties, nieces and nephews, cousins and especially my dear children and grandchildren. Thank you Leise for the introduction. When she inquired as to how I was to be introduced I simply told her to pretend she was giving a eulogy and go from there. It’s always great to see how you’ve lived your life in the eyes of your children…while you’re still alive! My kids know that the only thing I want from them is to live the gospel to the fullest, because that’s the only way we can be together as an eternal family!&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I’d like to thank the President’s Council for this special invitation. After 20 years of being at BYU-Hawaii and avoiding the invitation, I finally said “yes” to speaking at a devotional. Actually when I was called, after listening to the long speech on the other side of the phone, I simply answered, “No thanks”. Poor Lisa was caught off guard, so I said, “Why, hasn’t anyone said no before?” She calmly responded, “Well, no, not really Sister Reid.” I laughed and figured I’d better accept the invitation this time.</p>
<p>I often reflect on the day my sister Maryann and I first came to Hawaii. I was 6 years old and she was 5. I couldn’t imagine why my parents would allow their children to leave them at that age but that event impacted me for the rest of my life. I remember in those days the Pan American flight came once a month to Samoa, and it was a big island event. I can still smell the captivating fragrance of the moso’oi leis and the strumming of the guitars as busloads of people would gather at the airport to see who was coming and who was leaving that day. I remember my mom and dad whispering to us as we huddled for the final goodbye: “You are going to get a better education, then you will come back”. So my sister and I came with my grandfather, Miki Ah You. Uncle Junior often said my grandmother spoiled us more than her own children. Now that I’m a grandmother myself, I know exactly how that feels.</p>
<p>I remember when we first went to Laie Elementary School. My sister and I were placed in the same kindergarten class. I was so embarrassed to be in the same class as my younger sister. It was a thing then to change your name when you come to America. You know, Enele became Henry, Tomasi became Tom. So my aunt’s husband, Komisi, took us to school that first morning and without telling me, he changed my name to “Lorrance”. Because they called me “Louena” at home or ‘ENA for short, he thought the best way to fa’apalagi my name was to call me “Lorrance”. Mind you, the only real English words I knew then was yes and no. Throughout the day when my teacher asked me something I would simply answer “Yes” or “No”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of that first day, the teacher asked my Aunty Leise, who came over from her class to pick us up, “Is something wrong with your niece? Every time I called her name she would just answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. It was only then that I learned of my new name. So I struggled through that whole first year with my insecurities of being in a new environment. When we got to first grade, I had a kind, patient teacher, Sister Ruby Enos, who kept me in during recess and worked with me while the other kids were out playing. She taught me to read and write and speak English. When I finally was moved up a grade that year, I felt my first sense of accomplishment!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever been so afraid and discouraged as you faced a challenge that seemed far beyond your ability? Have you ever wanted to give up? I did at that time.</p>
<p>There are many scriptures full of accounts of men and women who showed great courage to do whatever the Lord commanded them to do, even when the tasks seemed impossible and even when they may have wanted to give up.</p>
<p>I wondered how young Joseph, son of Jacob, felt as his own brothers sold him into Egypt. Can you imagine being thrown into the courts of Pharaoh? But something happened because he was favored of the Lord and because he did not have a quitting attitude. Instead, his master found favor with him and made him ruler of everything he had, indeed his household.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course his Master’s wife falsely accused Joseph and caused him to be imprisoned. Did he quit then? No, because the Lord was with Joseph and he was of God, all prisoners were put under him. Through the miracle of interpretation of dreams, Joseph was released was set over all the land of Egypt, and blessed his family because of it. The power of “hanging in there” and never giving up!</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>And this same Joseph’s father, Jacob, had to work 7 years for Rachel only to find out it was Leah that he had to marry first then worked another 7 years for Rachel. Talk about commitment and love.</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>And who can forget Job? Imagine if he had quit after the first plague that was put upon him. And the suffering he had to bear!</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What about Abraham and his only son Isaac? &nbsp;How could the Lord ask of them to make such a sacrifice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Imagine Lehi and Sariah to leave all their riches behind and to flee from their home and friends in Jerusalem to live in the wilderness? In a tent?</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Or faithful, obedient Nephi in returning back to pick up the golden plates from Laban?</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Imagine when the Lord selected Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. “I am not eloquent, and am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.“<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> The Lord gave him Joshua to be his spokesperson. Is anything too hard for the Lord?&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Now imagine how Joshua must have felt when he was asked to take over after Moses, knowing that he was the one to lead the children of Israel to the promise land. I’m sure he wanted to give up. The Lord comforted him and reminded him to be strong and courageous. God assured the children of Israel that through faith, they committed, “All that thou commandest… we will do”.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Heber J. Grant was left fatherless from infancy and he worked closely with his mother growing up. He wanted to play baseball but was often made fun of in his attempt to throw and to bat. He promised to himself that one day he would play baseball, so he practiced hard every day until his hands hurt at night. He fulfilled his dream and played baseball and retired from the sport. Additionally his penmanship was so poor that a close friend of his kidded him that his writing was as if lightning struck an inkbottle. That hurt his pride a little, so he kept practicing and perfecting his penmanship until his penmanship became so good, so beautiful that people often paid him to write their cards. These experiences in persistence, without doubt, helped and prepared him to lead the church through a trying period of war and financial problems.</p>
<p>As we read about the lives of men and women in scripture, it is easy to see how people can triumph over adversity. But in everyday living, it is often difficult to see beyond our own frustrations, to stay focused, and to see the light at the end of the trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I received my Masters in Educational Counseling working in the Seattle area where my husband and I resided, I was convinced by my uncle Junior to move back to Laie. I finally was able to get back to my counseling field at Kahuku High School and was well aware of the climb upwards towards administrative level. During the summer break we decided to go back to Samoa to visit my parents who unfortunately were divorced at the time, and I felt the need to visit and be with my mom. My husband, a 6’2” good looking Samoan boy born in Daly City, San Francisco area, did not want to return to Samoa. Ernie’s father passed away at 42 when Ernie was only 14 but since his widowed mom was still there, he agreed to go. I, on the other hand, actually wanted to move home and help my mom with the family business and living situation due to the divorce. Ernie, aware of my desire to move back, made the mistake of challenging me that if I was able to find a job that would pay for our airfares back home and that provided housing for our family, we would return. And I had ONE week to do all of that. Don’t you just hate it when someone challenges you to something they think you wouldn’t be able to do? I hustled to begin my search for a job. Imagine my husband’s surprise when I told him that I got a job as a rehabilitation counselor for the Department of Public Safety. They were looking for a second person to hire to assist with their rehabilitation efforts, and they had just hired a graduate from BYU-Hawaii and needed one more. After they offered me the job, I had to convince them to pay our airfares back, relocate my family and provide housing. Aren’t you from here? Don’t you have family to live with? I went through an investigative period over that but I was so determined to complete all the requirements my husband laid out for me. Besides, if they were to hire someone from outside to do the job, they’d have to pay their airfare, put them up in housing, etc. I got a one year contract, and after that I promised my husband that we would return to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Of course Ernie lost the bet. We came back and packed up our little family and moved to Samoa with airfares paid and a place to live. A year later, Star-Kist advertised for an Assistant Personnel Manager as a crucial response to their anti-union efforts. Brothers and sisters, we ended up living in Samoa for 10 more years after that and absolutely loved it! They were growing times for us as I witness the Lords hand in Ernie’s spiritual progression in the church. How he struggled with the culture and language and when he was called as a bishop. I can guarantee you that being a bishop in Samoa is not the same as being a bishop anywhere else in the world as the Saints rallied and helped him with all the proper cultural protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not easy for us to come back here, but we did as we both felt the strong promptings of the spirit to do so. The Reid’s are business owners in Samoa and didn’t really feel the need to get a degree. I came first to get settled. I tried my best to make our TVA apartment look appealing. We lived in TVA N160 just so you know. There’s nothing wrong with TVA in itself. Remember, when you go to college, fall in love, get married, and then move to TVA while you’re still a student, that’s different! Imagine you’ve done the college thing, you’ve worked a good job, you built a brand new house 4 bedroom 3 bath with a living room and a family room plus a basketball court, then you convince your family (especially your children) to leave it and squeeze in to a 1 1/2 bedroom at TVA. I remember my kids dropping their luggage in the living room and crying, “Why did you bring us here?” That was a trying time for us too; yet the Lord is wiser than us, and had we not come at that time, Ernie would not have completed his college degree, we would have never discovered his illness, and he would have never been called as a bishop again in the Laie 7th Ward, a calling he absolutely loved. All this, because of the power of belief and faith and willingness to keep going when the going looked tough, to keep our eyes focused, and to never, ever quit!</p>
<p>Someone has said, “Life is tough, then you die!” What a statement!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew then that you can do anything you want. If the desire is there, if you can see what the end result would be, you will NOT quit because quitting IS NOT an option! It’s motivation to move forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember what the Lord said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea... and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after they, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good”.<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott said it wisely when he talked at the October 1991 general conference:</p>
<p>Trust [the Lord], even when in eternal perspective it temporarily hurts very much. Have patience when you are asked to wait when you want immediate action. . . . The path you are to walk through life may be very different from others. You may not always know why He does what He does, but you can know that He is perfectly just and perfectly merciful.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>My own sister suffered the biggest loss of all as she tried to make sense of the tragedy that happened to her son, Daniel Jackson Mapu. Just a year after the tragic accident, she remembered the incident as follows. I know the Lord does not give trials that we cannot bear and this experience has become the symbol of my sister and her family’s faith. They never complained in taking care of Daniel until his death, January 2014.</p>
<p>Not only are the scriptures a source of perseverance but secular history also teaches us this principle. On one occasion, Winston Churchill, well known for his leadership in Great Britain during World War II, decided to return to a school where he had studied as a boy. Prior to his arrival, the headmaster told the students, “The greatest British of our time is going to come to this school, and I want every one of you to be here prepared with your notebooks. I want you to write down what he says, because his speech will be something for you to remember all your lives.” On the day of his arrival, Churchill came in and was introduced. As usual, his glasses were down on the end of his nose. As he stood and delivered the following words from a speech he once gave in Parliament, he said, “Never, never, never give up.” Then he sat down. And that was it. That was the speech he gave. It was unmatched.<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup> Can you imagine every boy who heard that speech that day and each of us. Never, never, never give up!&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 4 years ago, I made the decision to pursue my doctorate degree. It was something I always wanted to do, but the timing was never right. I remember my husband encouraging me to go for it, but I just couldn’t see myself thinking about it, not while he was going through his medical treatments. I knew that once I made that commitment I would have to go all the way until it was done. Shortly after he passed away I felt that urge again to do it, so I started on my journey. It was the hardest thing I have ever tried to do. Of course, from a single income household I was still working a full time job, worked a second job as a Samoan language instructor, had an on-call job at the PCC’s Breath of Life show at the same time serving as stake Relief Society President. All the missed birthdays, the family events, hospitalizations, funerals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stayed behind after work, and studied, and wrote, and studied again some nights rushing over to the PCC night show with my books and in between sections I’d be reading and studying and coming back after the show to the office to study some more. Oh many times I wanted to just quit! But I remember writing my graduation date in my mind and when I was tired I thought of that graduation date and got up and just kept going.</p>
<p>I am so thankful for my good friends who cheered for me and encouraged me. For the support of my family especially my dear mother who kept saying, “If your dad was here…” or “you’re doing it for Ernie” or “Ena, you’ve got to do it for your students.” A friend would often remind me at Foodland or at Ace’s or even at the parking lot whenever he saw me, “Hey, don’t you give up. The one who persists is the one who wins.” I knew I had to finish! When I finally submitted my final dissertation, I just sat down one evening and thanked the Lord for helping through it all. What it proved to me was that if I can do it, anybody can do it. Ann, I did it for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pres. James E. Faust uttered this profound statement: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perseverance is demonstrated by those who keep going when the going gets tough, who don’t give up even when others say, “It can’t be done.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>I was first moved to Academic Advising around the same time Ernie passed away, in fall 2010. I had no idea what the job expectations were, but I remember thinking I was going to treat it like it was the most important job at BYU-Hawaii. One thing I know for sure is that I love our students. I want the best for them. I want them to succeed and not quit! In my own way, I let them know that: real tough love kind of way. When I look at my computer screen and see the colorful “D’s” and “F’s” on the screen, I would talk to the students and say, “Listen, you are not here on vacation, but you are here to study. I’ll bet your mother and your father are praying for your success. Don’t waste their time and the church’s resources by throwing it all away.” The Academic Advisors are here to help you. Make them your best friend. They and many others here on campus want you to succeed. This sometimes “thankless” job has taught me more about BYU-Hawaii. I had a wonderful opportunity to work with our alumni around the world, and now I and other academic advisors are helping to prepare our students to be the genuine gold prophesied to be. This role has changed my thinking and my heart for the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen, a member of the Twelve Apostles said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Obstacles, delays and mistakes will challenge you through life’s journey. Do not dismiss nor diminish the specific role and responsibility that has been given you. You can shape who you become. You can be more than you are today, but you will always be you.”</p>
<p>A young boy was practicing to be a pitcher. He would throw the ball high in the air, and with all the strength he could muster, he swung the bat and missed. “C’mon batter, let’s go!” With that, he threw the ball high in the air, swung the bat and missed again. “C’mon batter, batter, you can do it!” Once again, he threw the ball high, turned to swing and missed again. This time he said, “Man, I’m a great pitcher!” Always find something positive to think about. It’s easy to find the negative. Focus, aim, and never look back.</p>
<p>I am so thankful for my Savior. So grateful that he did not quit at the Garden of Gethsemane. He, even the Son of God, prayed to His Father: “Please if it be thy will, remove this cup from me, but nevertheless, thy will be done.” He had a mission and He was not going to quit until his mission was accomplished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that we will maintain the spirit to move forward, to graduate my dear students to get married-if-you’re- still-single-and-find-the-right-person, to build the kingdom together, complete our mission here on earth, and to remember that quitting is not an option… for any of us! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen!</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha! I seek an interest in your prayers and thank Sister Meha for her generous introduction this morning. I am grateful for her righteous influence in our marriage and within our family circle. She has been extremely patient, forgiving and loving during our sojourn together. Her loving influence in our home has strengthened and sustained us in raising our children, who are now young adults. I am thankful and happy that she is with me this morning. She is a kindergarten teacher at Kahuku Elementary School. Today, the children in her class are at home with their families because it’s a waiver day and the teachers are spending time preparing. I am convinced there is a special place in heaven for teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>
<p>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</p>
<p>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</p>
<p>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</p>
<p>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>
<p>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p>
<p>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p>
<p>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
<p>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
<p>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves?</p>
<p>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My parents were sealed in the Hamilton New Zealand Temple at Tuhikaramea in March 1958, soon after its dedication. They were brought together by the Maori cultural practice of tomo, where a marriage is formally arranged by the grandfathers of the two communities to which the prospective bride and groom belong. They obediently acquiesced to their father’s wishes and settled in Hawkes Bay where our family was raised. My father was a sheep farmer after World War II. In his early fifties he became a high school Maori language teacher and later a community maatua whaangai advocate placing troubled Maori youth with Maori families to offer support and rehabilitation. My mother was also a school teacher, who after school taught piano lessons to LDS youth living in our community. She devoted her later years to family history, helping many Maori whanau find their whakapapa connections. By the time my parents reached their late seventies it was clear to our family that they needed round-the-clock care. Rather than put our parents in a care home, our youngest sister, Pare, took on the full-time responsibility of being their caregiver. Until they passed, mother in 2014 at age 91 and father this year at age 93, they were constantly cared for by our loving sister. Exhausted and worn out from offering her all for many years, the memory of Pare weeping at our father’s tangi reminds me that there is a place in heaven for those who care for elderly parents.</p>
<p>In the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior taught his disciples truths that are universally recognized and apply in our day:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</p>
<p>"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven.”<a href="#FN2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>“Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>As BYU-Hawaii ‘ohana, we have been brought to this campus to become members of a Zion university. It is not unusual to be asked: “Why did you move to Lā’ie?” For some it is simple: “I don’t really know or understand fully. We felt directed by the Lord to come here.” We have come here from every part of the world – more than 70 countries, speaking more than 30 languages and almost half of the students, faculty and staff are returned missionaries. Many of us come from families who have been in the church for several generations, and there are many here who are recent converts – modern-day pioneers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hallmark of a BYU-Hawaii education is the way in which each of us is preparing to lead and build through serving others. In his inspiring inaugural address, President Tanner set the tone for the progress of this campus toward further greatness – not only greatness in worldly accolades and accomplishments, but more importantly in fulfilling our fundamental mission – to be a place of refuge, a place where the “aloha spirit” emanates from the pure love of Christ; a campus that aspires to build character – to transform. To faculty, staff and students, President invites us all as ‘ohana to gain appreciation, tolerance and esteem for one another. There will be a “leavening” effect felt throughout the international church as the influence of graduates is “disproportionate to their numbers . . . they will be light bearers and leaders, builders and peacemakers.” I am thankful that this university is my alma mater, where I see students who are indigent, first-generation, late-bloomers and non-native speakers of English grow and flourish under the watchful care of our faculty and staff.</p>
<p>While you are students take advantage of the abundant resources available. Our academic advisors are not only dedicated to your success but also equipped to explain the details of your MAP and help you plan for academic success. Find out about career opportunities early – don’t wait until your last semester to sit down with one of our career professionals. Get to know as many faculty as you can. They believe in you and your potential to attain the skills and knowledge that will launch you toward career success. Make friends from other countries by joining the student associations and take full advantage of our unique ethnic diversity. Culture night is one of our most important campus and community traditions. Take full advantage of living in “the light of the temple.” You will likely not live so close to a temple again in your life. Maintain a high level of spirituality by regularly participating in temple ordinances. I testify that you will receive heightened spiritual awareness and inspiration as you devote time to strengthen your relationship with Heavenly Father by faithfully fulfilling your calling and attending the temple.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>Network with people you meet and develop your capacity to think outside the box. Find opportunities to meet others who are different yet share common values and beliefs. Look for opportunities to work so that can learn to serve and help others. Two weeks ago, I learned a powerful lesson from a colleague, who without hesitating agreed to accompany a young student home to her family after becoming too ill to continue her studies. It was inconvenient, and there was no hoopla over the decision to make a quick round-trip over a weekend to the mainland and back. This is one of countless acts of kindness and service on campus motivated by genuine care and evidence of true discipleship, as we strive to do our part.</p>
<p>When Sister Meha and I were completing our degrees, we looked forward to graduating and moving on. We enjoyed living in M building at TVA and attending our married student ward. We loved our neighbors and friends. Like some of you families here we were very busy with a heavy class load, work at PCC, BYU-Hawaii stake callings and very little time for fun. We were anxious to finish and start our lives as graduates. In our final year, I was offered a teaching position at the Church College of New Zealand. Some of you here either attended CCNZ or have family members who did - at least until the school closed at the end of 2009. The job offer was attractive. CES offered to pay our moving expenses and provide housing for us in Temple View. We made the decision a matter of prayer and fasting. Realizing that our prayers had been answered, we were able to fulfill my commitment to return home to serve. We learned that returning to New Zealand was an act of faith, but we had seen other couples do this, and their example gave us confidence that all would work out well if we exercised faith and did our part.</p>
<p>In the next few minutes, I want you to ponder several questions as we learn about alumni who graduated and answered the call to return home to serve.</p>
<p>1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>How is my education and experience at BYU-Hawaii making a difference in my life?</p>
<p>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Where will I go after I leave this campus?</p>
<p>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What is one of the challenges I am having as a student and how can I find an answer?</p>
<p>4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Based on what I know today, what advice would I share with prospective students?</p>
<p>5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>How do I feel about the mission of the university – to learn, lead and build?</p>
<p>Charlie and Pierne Revillo came to the university from the Philippines as single students, met and married in the Lā’ie Hawaii Temple. Their five children are growing. Kevin, the eldest, is a returned missionary enrolled here this semester. Second son, Steve, will return to campus soon as a returned missionary. Reflecting recently Charlie mused: “I am a better man because of BYU-Hawaii and it helped me prepare for graduate school and a lifetime of service in the church and in the community.” While some people thought they were cray, the decision was not difficult for the Revillo’s: &nbsp;“I’ve always wanted to go home after getting my education. I made a commitment that I would return and also made a promise that I would serve my country and the church in the Philippines. I honored that commitment by serving there for 19 years. I can’t mock God and BYU-Hawaii.”</p>
<p>Speaking of their challenges while attending classes full-time with one child born in Laie and another one born in Provo, Charlie explained that financial worries were always there: “We exercised faith, worked hard and budgeted. We also made sure that we paid our tithes on time.” Their advice to prospective students is direct and practical: “First things first. Be worthy of a temple recommend always. If you do that, you will be blessed and will be guided in your decisions. Study hard, go on missions, get married while you are in college and then go home after graduation.”</p>
<p>Looking back they receive perspective from their experience: “Because of the mission of BYU-Hawaii our family is spiritually stronger and happier.” On a lighter note, says Charlie: “I hope that all students will find the Son of God and not just sun and sand.”<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>Michael and Ann Sarafian met on campus, married in 1999 and returned to Australia in 2001. Their decision was not easy, because Ann was born in New Mexico and was raised for most of her life in Thailand. I met Ann and her family at the Asoke chapel in Bangkok and felt impressed that she had the desire and temperament to be a successful student. When the challenge of keeping up with their studies began to take a toll, they kept their commitment to attend the temple each week and even became ordinance workers: “The temple became the focus of the week and everything else fell into place.” As ordinance workers in the Lā’ie Hawaii Temple, Sister Meha and I have the privilege of serving with wonderful students each Tuesday evening, helping patrons enjoy spiritual experiences in the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Sarafians have learned to adjust and adapt to their changing family circumstances. A career change for Michael into a new field has provided unanticipated experiences for the family, including an awareness that our mission – to learn, lead and build - is a principle of self-reliance. Offering advice Michael notes: “Through the effort we put forth to gain an education, we better ourselves, so that we are able to help others learn and become self-reliant.</p>
<p>Ben and Danelle Fobert are among the finest people I know. We met serving in a married student ward bishopric while Danelle served as the Relief Society President. Currently, Ben is the principal of a new high school just out of San Francisco and has served in the bishopric and Young Men’s program. Danelle takes care of the children, organizes Joy School for pre-schoolers, organizes Independence Day parades, helps raise funds for school construction and each year finds time to have fun at Girl’s Camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of their experience in the late 1990’s they explained: “We both felt, quite literally, that the prophecy given through David O. McKay in regards to students… going into the world to be an influence for good and peace on an international scale applied to us. To have been blessed to have been admitted to such a place with a prophetic promise instilled in us a sense of purpose that continues to this day.”</p>
<p>As seniors, the biggest hurdle they faced was preparing for the birth of their first child while completing student teaching. Ben recounts: “With a strong faith in the Lord’s plan for our lives and tons of righteous examples of the scores of married couples living in TVA, we knew this challenge was something that could be shouldered together. When Meilani was born, it was life changing. Not only did we feel a new kind of love for one another and this little baby, but we found an outpouring of love and support from our fellow students and a love and understanding from our professors and teachers.” Many people helped the Foberts through those last weeks and months. Danelle affirms: “This was all done selflessly by all involved and we are forever in debt to all our BYUH brothers and sisters. The Lord truly provided for us and honored our commitment to education through the end.”</p>
<p>After graduation they moved backed to the San Francisco Bay Area to live near their families. They found work managing apartment complexes while Ben worked full-time. Part of their decision to live in the South Bay was “grounded in the desire to teach in urban schools where equity and social justice would consistently be in the forefront of Ben’s work… A job fair in the CAC brought an answer to prayer in the form of a job offer to teach in East Side San Jose.” After years of hard work and much sacrifice, Ben is completing his doctoral degree in education leadership.</p>
<p>The Foberts want prospective students to consider “the opportunities the Lord stands to provide for you at BYU-Hawaii: “This campus is truly a place with a prophetic purpose…. Are you willing to consider your role in the mission of bringing peace to the world? Are you willing to look beyond the beautiful physical settings and truly absorb the true spirit of learning in a unique way? Because of the prophetic promise you have the opportunity to access the blessings of that promise in all that you do for the remainder of your life. It is both a blessing and a responsibility. Look to enjoy your surroundings, “learn and adapt to the culture and study like your life depends on it. Your unique experience will make you unique and will bring you opportunities and blessings that you could not have otherwise imagined. This is not just a 4 year stop in Hawaii. It is an experience that will put Hawaii and the spirit of Aloha in your heart for the rest of your days.”</p>
<p>Meet the Vitinavulagis of Suva, Fiji. Wouldn’t it be fun to attend sacrament meeting and sit at the end of their pew? Two years ago, I attended an assembly at Fiji LDS Church College where Ernest is a biology teacher. I immediately felt his love as we embraced. Our paths had crossed when our family served in a campus ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grateful for opportunities to serve among his people, he relates: “Now I know the meaning of what Pres. David O. McKay said decades ago to go back home and to help build my nation and God’s Kingdom in my homeland Fiji. I’ve served in bishoprics as counselors and as a bishop, I’m currently serving in the stake presidency as First Counselor and this is my second time in [this assignment.] I’ve served in many callings in the church and also community projects. The islands need graduates to help build our nations and God’s kingdom.”</p>
<p>Ernest offers sound advice to youth and YSA in Fiji seeking to know where they should pursue further education: “Work hard, work smart as if everything depends on ‘you’, then get on your knees and pray as if everything depends on the Lord. Remember BYUH is a special university, like no other, second to none.”</p>
<p>All of us here are preparing for the future… students for careers and families and, employees for retirement, enjoying our families and giving service. The Vitinavulagis are living the dream - raising their children and fulfilling their work, community and church commitments by applying the lessons learned in classes, at TVA, in student wards and at the PCC. You should know that during his time, Ernest was one of Fiji’s best dancers at the PCC. His experiences and talents enabled him to organize the cultural celebration for the rededication of the Suva Fiji Temple earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mihimana Tauru from Tahiti loved every minute of her experience as a student. She is the one wearing the flower in her left ear. Expressing appreciation she notes: “It’s been six years since I walked on that stage in the CAC to receive my diploma and I still remember my experience as if it were yesterday. I forever cherish those memories. College years are often decisive in the life of a student where a lot of important decisions are made. By attending BYU-Hawaii I gained more than an education and more than I could ever list.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family is a powerful motivating influence in our lives. Mihimana knew that her family needed her in Tahiti: “I gained four wonderful years and I went home with more knowledge, new skills, lifelong friendships and heart full of gratitude. It was time to move on to new things, to keep learning and to serve along the way.”</p>
<p>Trying to find a balance between competing demands is difficult. Mihimana found that it was tough to find a balance and stay motivated: we just have to keep moving forward… but in La’ie…&nbsp;you never really feel alone… if you seek it, you will always find help.” Her advice to future students will never get old: “Decide now that you will succeed… just as you decide to be obedient to the commandments… when we use what we learned to edify and inspire others, and to make an actual difference for the better and for the whole, we are then fulfilling the mission of our school and the purpose it was created for. We become genuine gold by serving others.”</p>
<p>Faculty and staff will remember Dustin Bradshaw. He is an eternal optimist, driven to succeed. After graduating six years ago, he helped staff the International Entrepreneurship Center on campus while his wife Hiva finished her degree. An offer to become a Foreign Service officer in the U.S. Department of State took them to the U.S. Embassies in Manila and Instanbul. Those years were exciting for the Bradshaws: “We had a front row seat in seeing the Church grow in both areas and were blessed serving in the Lord’s worldwide vineyard. We developed a love for the people we worked with and lived around that will continue for years.” After a brief stint with LDS Philanthropies, Dustin joined the Self-Reliance Perpetual Education department at church headquarters to help establish Self-Reliance Services across the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our education at BYU-Hawaii we learn many lessons about what is important and of value. Dustin found that “there is more to your education than the books and a degree.” What has set him apart has been the experiences with a diversity of students, participating in projects and programs outside of “book learning.” He offers this advice: “Get involved. Study with classmates, join cultural clubs. Invest yourself into your work. You will leave with experiences that will boost your ability to get a job in the future because you are a leader, a peace maker.”<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>Royce and Melanie Tai live in Malaysia. I met them while they were attending the BYU-Hawaii 14th ward, now known as the Laie Married Student 5th Ward. While on Optional Practical Training with a company based in Alburqueque, Royce was offered a position in the Shanghai office for two years. This stint led to relocating home to Malaysia to become country manager covering Singapore as well. Last year he formed his own logistics business and his main client is the U.S. military. He does contract work – handling ground movement of equipment, supplies and personnel. In addition, he provides interpreting services to assist in joint military exercises between the Malaysian government forces and the U.S. military. In the last three years, Royce has served as a counselor in a branch presidency, the branch as president and currently as a counselor in the district presidency.</p>
<p>Royce explained that BYUH “opened him to be forward thinking… showed me that people can work together regardless of race, nationality and gender as long as we see we are heading toward the same goal.” When it came time to decide where to live and raise their family Royce explained: “it was as simple as an answer to a prayer in the temple…&nbsp;We were deliberating on a decision that was job-related and I felt that I should make my way back to our home country… I always knew I would go back to [Malaysia] to be able to put to work all that I have learned and gained and my mission in Australia which is to grow the church while serving others.”</p>
<p>Even on a good day, university life can be overwhelming. Learning how to overcome our personal challenges allows us to change and grow. Describing his background Royce explained, “Coming from a background that had groomed me to be an introvert, being in BYU-Hawaii was not easy at first, when everyone was so open, friendly and not afraid. It took time but I learned to push myself to get out of my comfort zone. I still like to enjoy my own quiet time but I don’t hesitate being around people when I need to.”</p>
<p>At BYU-Hawaii one of the things we do really well is make connections with people that turn into lifelong friendships. The connections Royce built with professors, admin staff and others made his experience meaningful and enjoyable: “I always made sure I was connecting with the professors and that they knew me and I knew them… the admin staff went out of their way to help…&nbsp;they never made me feel like I was just another number. In short, I have many lifelong friends.”</p>
<p>Tserennyam Sukhbaatar is from Mongolia. He and his wife are standing on our right in this photo. Summarizing his experience he recalled: “BYU-Hawaii taught me a lot. It opened my eyes and widened my vision and goals. It is a very nice place to learn. Multi-culture is definitely the unique part of BYU-Hawaii. Education and experience helped me to go up the career path.”</p>
<p>Returning home was not easy. However, it was simple: “I promised to return to Mongolia graduation. I promised Heavenly Father to return. I decided to keep my commitment. Of course, I had some opportunities to stay, but… eventually my wife and I chose the right thing to do. Satan tried to tempt a lot… but never beat the Christ.”</p>
<p>Being far from family and the comforts of home can be challenging. Of their experience living in TVA he states, “Honestly I didn’t face much challenge. It was all a blessing to me. [I got a job at PCC.] Everything was just fine… well maybe transportation was not that good. Once I waited for two buses for half a day to get to Lā’ie from another city… Sometimes, couple missionaries or good people who had cars helped us a lot.”</p>
<p>Tserennyam’s advice to students is practical: “Learn English. Set a goal to reach. Choose your major. Keep the commandments and covenants, then do your best when you are in school.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission positively influenced Tserennyam in the work place, especially when facing pressure to act in ways that were not in keeping with his standards. In his words he describes the dilemma: “BYU-Hawaii teaches ethics which is really needed for Mongolians. My country is full of bribes and dishonesty. With knowledge gained, students can build a better society wherever they may go and lead by their example. I faced challenges after my schooling. Many dishonest, unethical offers came to me while I was working. Because of what I have learned and promised to keep, I was able to overcome those challenges in my life. Some of them asked me why I had to choose the way they didn’t want. I always shared the gospel with them instead.”</p>
<p>In a moment of reflection on returning home and being called into the stake presidency, Tserennyam notes, “I have been given much. I have been blessed a lot. BYU-Hawaii is truly a blessing to me and my family. It is exactly as the prophet said. I always feel that I am part of that prophecy. As long as I keep the commandments and commitments I have made with Heavenly Father, I will always be just fine. He will guide me. I won’t be wrong. I wish many Mongolian students remember where they come from.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love these alumni and their families and thank them for sharing with us an important part of who they have become and their efforts to establish peace. They are a minute subset of more than 31,000 alumni of BYU-Hawaii. I acknowledge and understand the sacrifices their families made to send them to study here, as my parents sent four of us to Lā’ie. This is their university. It is our university. It is the Lord’s university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I reflect on the countless experiences and blessings that my family and I have received through our association on campus and in Lā’ie, I think of the 153 students in the first class of the Church College of Hawaii and the dedicated faculty and staff who labored to build this institution. In our respective roles and assignments we are making our contribution to prepare our students of today to become leaders in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, listen to and act upon President Monson’s admonition given at Commencement on this campus in December 2002:</p>
<p>“We do not live alone – in our city, our nation, or our world. There is no dividing line between our prosperity and our neighbor’s wretchedness. “Love they neighbor” is more than a divine truth. It is a pattern for perfection. This truth inspires the familiar charge, “go forth to serve.” Try as some may, we cannot escape the influence our lives have upon the lives of others. Ours <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>is the opportunity to build, to lift, to inspire, and indeed to lead.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>That we may all gladly do our part and bear good fruit is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Aloha, my dear brothers and sisters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several months ago our dog, Barclay, who is usually well behaved, began to show a different side of his personality. One evening after dinner, we didn't clean up very well and he seized the moment. All seventy pounds jumped onto the table for a glorious feast—a pile of chicken bones lying in a puddle of Shoyu-flavored grease that was just too much to resist. When my wife, Stacy, discovered him lying on top of the table eating out of the Pyrex dish she was rather surprised.</p>
<p>We laughed this one off but a day or two later it happened again. At lunch, Barclay was sitting up tall, staring at the sliding glass door that looks onto the back porch. I was curious. Stacy reported how he had managed to open the door of the pantry and raid the package of marshmallows on the bottom shelf. This time, however, his behavior was rewarded with scraps of a different kind. Scolded, contrite, and forlorn, he seemed to be learning the lesson of a lifetime. Perhaps he was having a moment of self-reflection.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I am not a dog-psychologist, but I accept that each of us, from time to time, has a moment of truth. Shakespeare captured this well in the famous line from Julius Caesar: "The eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things."<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> Like Barclay seeing himself in the glass, the mirror from which we examine ourselves is the gospel. And, it too may be understood by looking at "other things" outside of itself. For me, analyzing and performing music complements and enriches my understanding of the plan of salvation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate, I offer a behind-the-scenes look for several compositions drawn from the repertoire of French composers at the turn of the twentieth-century, namely Maurice Ravel (1875–1937) and Claude Debussy (1862–1918). In the first example, Ravel's enigmatic comment about an unfinished trio parallels the spiritual creation of the earth, the stage on which we now prove ourselves. We'll then consider how the American poet, Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849), influenced both artists, as a prelude to seeing musical forms analogously to patterns of eternal progression in our own lives.</p>
<p>Maurice Ravel once quipped to his student Maurice Delage, "My Trio is finished. I only need the themes for it."<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a> </sup>For those unfamiliar with the terminology of classical music, themes are the melodies and the starting place for most compositions. Perhaps the best-known example is three short dramatic Gs followed by a long E-flat, repeated down a step.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>In the pre-mortal realm our Heavenly Father organized the framework of the earth before setting the physical creation in motion: "For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air."<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a> </sup>Like Ravel's nearly finished composition without notes, Heavenly Father had prepared an earth for us to "work out [our] own salvation with fear and trembling."<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>The plan itself was simple. With the gift of agency, we would experience mortality through a succession of choices. In this second phase, however, we would not have the advantage of remembering what came before, in order to have a true test of character. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell explains, "Agreeing to enter this second estate, therefore, was like agreeing in advance to anesthetic—the anesthetic of forgetfulness. Doctors do not de-anesthetize a patient, in the midst of what was previously authorized, to ask him again, if it should be continued. We agreed to come here and to undergo certain experiences under certain conditions."<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a> &nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>One challenge would be to subdue our carnal natures—to learn and live eternal laws of righteousness, while housed in telestial bodies. As President Brigham Young taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told you here, some time ago, that the devil who tempted Eve, got possession of the earth, and reigns triumphant, has nothing to do with influencing our spirits, only through the flesh; that is a true doctrine. Inasmuch as our spirits are inseparably connected with the flesh, and, inasmuch as the whole tabernacle is filled with the spirit which God gave, if the body is afflicted, the spirit also suffers, for there is a warfare between the flesh and the spirit, and if the flesh overcomes, the spirit is brought into bondage, and if the spirit overcomes, the body is made free, and then we are free indeed, for we are made free by the son of God.<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a> &nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Modern revelation also reminds us that the vast majority of mankind will inherit degrees of glory, the highest being the celestial kingdom as described in sections 76, 132, and 137 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>For our second musical example, we begin with Ravel's enjoyment of transforming themes from a basic idea. In his analysis of Ravel's Menuet sur le nom d'Haydn (Minuet on the Name of Haydn), the musicologist Arbie Orenstein describes the melody as "A free adaptation of the Renaissance ‘soggetto cavato’ (a ‘carved-out subject’)" and points out that "the name H–A–Y–D–N turns out to be B–A–D–D–G. H stands for B-natural in German, and the remaining letters derive from the alphabet. …In the score, each appearance of the Haydn motif [theme] is indicated (forward, backward, and upside down)."<a href="#FN8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>For those familiar with Impressionism, it will come as no surprise that Ravel and Debussy were influenced by the American poet, Edgar Allan Poe. Ravel claimed him as his "greatest teacher."<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a>&nbsp;</sup>In his essay, The Philosophy of Composition, Poe first explains why authors hide their trial-and-error work: "Most writers—poets in especial—prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy—an ecstatic intuition—and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought."</p>
<p>Poe then recounts the decisions he made to give meaning to the refrain "Nevermore," in his poem The Raven, illustrating a focused crescendo of emotions leading to the final conclusion:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw that I could make the first query [question] propounded by the lover—the first query to which the Raven should reply "Nevermore" — that I could make this first query a commonplace one—the second less so—the third still less, and so on—until at length the lover, startled by the original nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself—by its frequent repetition—and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it—is at length excited to superstition, and wildly propounds queries of a far different character—… Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me—or, more strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction—I first established in mind the climax, or concluding query—that to which "Nevermore" should be in the last place an answer—that in reply to which this word "Nevermore" should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair."<a href="#FN10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Poe's organization of The Raven reminds me, as a Latter-day Saint, to see the end from the beginning and work backwards, as it were, to progress eternally through determined repetition. As a young boy, I was motivated to read a large-print copy of the Book of Mormon because it featured illustrations by Arnold Friberg. Although the images were sparse in comparison to the prose overall, my goal was to start from the beginning and read the pages in-between, looking forward with great anticipation to the next picture. These included Samuel the Lamanite preaching with outstretched arms, perched on top of the city wall, unharmed by a flood of arrows, and an aging Lehi and his family crossing the sea.</p>
<p>An incentive for reading the Book of Mormon in my teenage years was food, promised by teachers at church. Later as a missionary in South Carolina I memorized dozens of scriptures to learn the fundamental doctrines of the gospel. At BYU-Provo, I sought out specific religion professors, ones who could offer substantive insight. My focus of study changed as a mature adult once I began to prepare lessons for youth and gospel doctrine classes. Now, as a YSA bishop, I find myself reading differently than ever before, carefully searching out individual words and passages that may have been glossed over earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comparable to a layered understanding of the scriptures, our view of the temple changes too, throughout our lives. When we first go through for ourselves, we may not fully grasp the meaning of the endowment. But, after giving our best efforts and staying true to what we've learned, our confidence and resolve expand. We refine our ability to seek answers through revelation. Eventually this sustained effort, over a period of years, helps us grow into our covenants. Looking back, we begin to sense our Heavenly Father's steady, yet unseen, hand and the wisdom of His intervening at particular times and places. Ultimately, we perceive the larger architecture of the Plan of Salvation, which offers a context for knowing ourselves, similar to notes on the printed page that take on a new meaning, once the hidden organization of a musical framework becomes apparent through analysis.</p>
<p>According to the Scottish pianist, Roy Howat, Debussy's prélude "La Cathédrale engloutie" ("The Sunken Cathedral") "follows a celtic myth of [a] submerged city…[rising] once a year through sea mists with pealing cathedral bells, organ and chanting monks, before sinking again."<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a> </sup>As we'll hear in Stacy's final performance, the passage is effective because Debussy, like Poe, organized this section with the end in mind. The start of the climax begins after a lengthy buildup and coincides with the loudest dynamic overall, while thick chords enter and imitate the sound of an organ in the heavenly key of C Major as the modulation settles.<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Just as Poe's repetition was purposeful, Debussy's compositional style was too. The undetected formula in "The Sunken Cathedral" is the Golden Section ratio. Simply put, for a Golden Section piece, if we take the length of time that it takes to be performed, and divide this total by 38.2 or 61.8 percent, we can expect to find a moment of significant musical interest at these points.<a href="#FN13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Debussy was not an expert mathematician. The arithmetic, however, is simple if Fibonacci numbers are used, and "The Sunken Cathedral" reveals these patterns. Starting with 0 and 1, the last two digits are added to each other. Doing so yields the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc. While we don't know Debussy's intentions with certainty, he likely organized the larger sections according to these numbers. As such, the composition unfolds naturally and feels expansive, because the musical ideas, which play out in time, match the framework. Generally speaking, Debussy's ideal was to create music that sounded as if the ink was still wet on the page. On the surface everything appears improvisatory, when in reality, there are intricate designs underneath. As Howat suggests in his book Debussy in Proportion, the all-important theme, which I described earlier as being "in the heavenly key of C major," arrives at 21 units into the piece, which has 55 overall—the precise moment of the short division, or .381.<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>For me, this point of Golden Section, relevant to what came before as well as after, is the metaphorical equivalent of a revelation, communication timed perfectly by our Heavenly Father to renew our vision and direction. Brothers and Sisters, what are the Golden Section moments of our lives, and what are the traps that keep us from reaching our potential? As we attempt to answer these questions, I believe it is vital that we look to the scriptures, from which I will quote freely and juxtapose against my own words in the second half of my talk. They teach us that each phase of our existence depends on decisions made in the world before. Just as we followed the Savior in the pre-mortal realm, we must now remember how He sacrificed station and status to become the Savior of mankind: "He received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness; And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first."<sup><a href="#FN15">15 </a></sup>If He, the Creator of the world, had to progress incrementally, then we do too. And if we are to achieve celestial glory, like the Savior, whose life unfolded perfectly according to the Father's plan, what are the patterns to establish? Which ones should we avoid?</p>
<p>Patterns of descent</p>
<p>At one time or another, each of us is tempted to worship false gods. Everything may be going well. You've just finished your mission, having had a wonderful experience. Your days were filled with hard work and your focus was serving others. When you came home, your life changed with the consequent return to university life, work, and adjustment to the complexities of modern social life. In your moment of stress, you're tempted to return to the habits that once held you in spiritual darkness before your mission. Now is the time to be on your guard. You've experienced great heights and are stronger spiritually. Yet, you remain vulnerable.</p>
<p>Moses chapter 1 offers insights into the tactics of Satan. In verses 8 and 9 Moses shares his vision where "[He] beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created." His experiences were only possible in the flesh because the glory of God was upon him. Afterwards "The presence of God withdrew from Moses,…And as he was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth."</p>
<p>I like to think of this as a moment of Golden Section in Moses's life. He now knew with certainty who God was. "But now mine eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld: for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him." Then Satan tempted Moses, saying, "Moses, son of man, worship me."<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup> Here we see the real battle lines drawn when he addressed Moses as the "son of man."</p>
<p>Fortunately, he was able to discern correctly, precisely because his mortal body had been subjected to the glory of God, Moses having lost his physical strength for many hours afterwards. For him the distinction was clear: "I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me, and I were transfigured before him. But I can look upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so, surely?…Where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me: Worship God, for him only shalt thou serve.…I can judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan."<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest test of life is staying morally pure and avoiding sexual transgression. Whenever we indulge these unrighteous desires, if only briefly, or even with the intent to repent later, our testimonies erode. "And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit."<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Apostasy manifests itself in different ways. In Alma 31, the sophisticated Zoramites had their downfall when they replaced the god of their fathers with apathy and pride. "They would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses. Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation." Their theology and manner of worship changed the nature of God from a distinct being of flesh and bones to "spirit forever." Summarily, they denied the Christ. Following their logic of descent, they abandoned that part of their cultural heritage, which was good, declaring their belief to God himself: "Thou hast elected us to be thy children."<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Patterns of righteousness</p>
<p>Let's now turn our attention to patterns of righteousness. I offer four that will keep us in the right path: prevention, repentance, conversion, and sanctification through temple work.</p>
<p>In Alma 53:4, Teancum fortified the city Bountiful against further attack by having the captured Lamanites "build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch…[casting] up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork…until they had encircled the city…round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height."<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>We protect the inner banks of our souls through daily scripture study, which helps us recognize the manipulations of Satan.<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup> Ultimately, bolstering ourselves in this manner gives us the strength to "Exercise more control over even the marginal moments that confront [us],"<sup><a href="#FN22">22</a></sup> such as when a friend—or, a friend of a friend—posts suggestive images on social media. One solution is filtering our devices and browsers or blocking unwelcome guests. As the Savior taught, "If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."<sup><a href="#FN23">23</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, if we succumb to temptation we can repent. When Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden, they were gradually brought back into the presence of God. They began by sacrificing the firstlings of their flocks to prepare themselves to accept the Atonement. Adam's golden moment came in the form of a question posed by a visiting angel: "Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?" His reply: "I know not, save the Lord Commanded me…And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth. …that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will."<sup><a href="#FN24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Ravel's minuet where the letters of Haydn's name were transformed and repurposed, Alma the Younger, after being converted to the Savior, focused his efforts on the spiritual rebirth of others. Previously he had gone about with the sons of Mosiah destroying the church. As his future lay in the balance he remembered the Savior: "Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!"<sup><a href="#FN25">25</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reflective symmetry of Alma's past and future comes into striking relief in Alma 36, verse 21: "Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy." The depths of hell had changed to a vision of joy and when he saw "God sitting upon his throne…[his] soul did long to be there."<sup><a href="#FN26">26</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The final pattern is sanctification, through sustained temple worship.<sup><a href="#FN27">27</a></sup> Like Adam, who was visited by angels, we may receive the same power that he did when we experience the ordinances for ourselves. We read in Moses 5:58–9, "And thus the Gospel began to be preached, from the beginning, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost. And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance."&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the celestial kingdom like?</p>
<p>I recently had a moment of Golden Section. It came several weeks ago when Stacy and I toured Japan with the BYU-Hawai‘i Concert Choir. After two weeks, we finished our trip in Kyoto. That afternoon we went to the Kinkakuji Temple, which I had not heard of before. As we entered the path and pressed forward with the throngs of tourists, a stunning tableau opened before our eyes, which took my breath away. I was not prepared as we turned the corner. There was a golden temple, floating on the water, as it were. My first thought was to think of the many mansions in heaven, wondering if one of them might look like this, quite frankly, hoping that one could be reserved for me, surrounded in the tranquil perfection of nature. I then remembered the scripture, which talks of the celestial kingdom "having the appearance of [streets] paved with gold.<sup><a href="#FN28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>The laws of heaven</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters I doubt we will ever find ourselves in the celestial kingdom as superficial tourists. According to the Prophet Joseph Smith, "It is necessary for men to receive an understanding concerning the laws of the heavenly kingdom, before they are permitted to enter it:…God has in reserve a time…when He will bring all his subjects, who have obeyed His voice and kept His commandments, into His celestial rest. This rest is of such perfection and glory, that man has need of a preparation before he can, according to the laws of that kingdom, enter it and enjoy its blessings."<sup><a href="#FN29">29</a></sup> For each of us, these laws are learned within the walls of the temple.</p>
<p>As the Savior taught in the Parable of the Royal Marriage Feast, the frustrated king, who had struggled so many times before to get everyone to the table, finally directs his servants to try one last time:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[They] went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span>wedding was furnished with guests.</p>
<p>And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:<sup><a href="#FN30">30</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness;there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>For many are called, but few are chosen…wherefore all do not have on the wedding garment."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the thief from the highway, may it said of us: "They knew what good order was, for they had been orderly and obedient to the laws imposed on them by their wise sovereign,…Such individuals would indeed adorn any court where perfection was one of its main springs of action."<sup><a href="#FN31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>In closing, my dear brothers and sisters, may we imagine ourselves as the notes of an expertly crafted piece of music on a scale of grand proportion, guided lovingly by our Heavenly Father towards a majestic climax. Like Haydn's name, spelled musically in the hands of Ravel, we are transformed by the Savior through purposeful repetition—put forward, backward, and upside down—when we study, pray, and serve others. Only He knows what we can become and the destiny that is ours if we will but exercise our agency properly.</p>
<p>The gospel teaches us the patterns of eternal progression. Sabbath-day observance, temple attendance, diligence, and repentance help us go forward, while transgression and apostasy leave us hanging in the balance like Alma the Younger. Repent if necessary and redirect your physical appetites. In short, place yourselves within the context of the Plan of Salvation. The decisions you make now are those that affect your future, and either confirm or contradict who you once were in the pre-mortal world. As you make choices, be constant in your resolve to keep covenants. I promise you that if you do so, you will gain a deeper and richer understanding. Someday you will know with certainty that Heavenly Father has woven the elements of your life together, with his unseen hand, into a finely woven tapestry. But only in our flashes of revelation and reflection can we realize the purposeful intervention in our lives, leading us, forward, back to him. These are our moments of Golden Section.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media160823<br><title>Which Thing I Never Had Supposed | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>23 August 2016<br />Phillip McArthur<br />Dean for College of Arts and Humanities, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Some years ago when I was a campus bishop I interviewed with a new member in my ward, Brady. He was a very pleasant young man with a warm and gentle disposition. Yet I could discern he was a little disheartened with a sad wonderment about life. I assumed he was responding to the typical student pressures and young adult uncertainties. Brady had recently served an honorable full-time mission and was doing everything he could to honor his covenants and retain a spiritual centering. As I queried a little more to see how I might counsel with him, he began to unfold some recent disquieting events that led him to wonder if God had forsaken him. He rehearsed how not long after his mission both his parents were killed in a car accident by a drunk driver, and this had left him rudderless. And then, within only a few months prior to our interview, his dear sister had been murdered during a grocery store burglary. This left him despondent, bordering on anger. And though he would never acquiesce to some of his darkest thoughts, he admitted, that at times he wished to disappear into oblivion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This temperate soul truly mourned, and in his sorrowing he was asking big questions about, “why?” Partly still in shock, and partly in deep reflection, he searched for a perspective he should take toward enduring these realities. He trusted that God loved him, but all the platitudes internalized since childhood did not provide him solace. His one remaining family member, another sister, encouraged him to come to BYU Hawai’i, to start fresh, to move, and if not forward, at least it was movement. So there he was before me, sincerely and nobly suffering, seeking a way to peer through the haze of his grief induced uncertainty and wonder. He supposed God had abandoned him, and was groping for clarity and strength to bear with patience such an unexpected turn in his life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through several tender and intimate conversations Brady and I explored ways for him to see, act, and heal. His principled character was displayed at his lowest moment. We talked much over the academic year, and I witnessed how, through the measure of time, mighty prayer, temple attendance, and purposeful service to others, even when he did not feel like it, his wounded heart and soul were being healed, and a purpose for life restored.</p>
<p>All of us carry burdens, perhaps not as acute as Brady’s, nonetheless they demand much from us. Some afflictions result from our own poor choices, our sins, or feeble, misguided, ignorant judgments. Much of our suffering we create for ourselves. But some troubles just happen as a condition of mortality, the vulnerabilities of bodies and minds. We get sick, we hurt, we age, and we die. There is no fault here, just the vicissitudes of a telestial condition. And then some loads we bear occasion the choices of others we have no control over. Others do things that may hurt us, whether intentional or unintentional, and we suffer for it. These acts may be daily inconveniences resulting from their self-interest, to unethical behaviors that affect livelihood, or cruelties to bodies, spirits, and minds. How do we make sense of, respond to, and endure these untoward actualities? Our suffering and perplexity may encourage two possible responses: &nbsp;We can entertain the “big” questions and allow the Spirit to teach us “…of things as they really are;”<a href="#FN1">1</a> or conversely, in dark resignation, we may wish to “…curse God, and die.”<a href="#FN2">2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;To safeguard the principle of agency, suffering cannot be exempted; to ensure accountability, we must tolerate evil, cruelty and a myriad of inhumane deprivations. The restored doctrine regarding the role of agency in spiritual progress identifies its necessity, as father Lehi articulates, for discernment, consciousness, and even existence itself. The eternal consequence, that we may act for ourselves and not be simply acted upon, advances the only truly salient explanation for why an interested and loving God would tolerate evil and suffering. (While we commonly elaborate on all the wrongs perpetuated against us, we too often neglect to recognize and correct how we ourselves may become a burden or trial to someone else.)</p>
<p>Much of our capacity to manage unexpected difficulties, whether of our own or another’s making, calls upon us to revise how we think about the meaning of our circumstances. Have you ever had to discard what you considered true when new knowledge abruptly came to light? If so you are not alone, many of the great prophets had to adjust their thinking. Consider the Apostle Paul, who as he went about seeking to destroy the fledgling Christian movement, was sharply addressed by the Lord on the road to Damascus. Could we not say he changed his mind about things? Or in a parallel fashion, consider Alma the Younger and the Sons of Mosiah, who too were about making themselves a nuisance to the Church, and we must conclude, “stressing out” their fathers. Angelic visitations have a way of getting attention. Such encounters can lead to a complete transformation in perspective. And then there was the young Joseph Smith, who, while sincere and inquisitive, remained ignorant until his numinous encounter with the divine changed everything for him--he would never see things the same again. All three of these illustrations are atypical; they involved a pronounced visionary experience, an intervention from heavenly beings--not the normal experience of our quotidian lives. Perhaps something this bold and clearly marked is necessary when the outcome will affect so many (the entire primitive Christian movement, the spiritual and social realignment of the Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, and the restoration of all things in the latter-days). But there remains still a telling pattern here for us as individuals; any conversion through the power of the Holy ghost can prove an indelible moment that leads to profound changes in thought, attitude, and disposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the most illustrative moments in scripture that demonstrates an abrupt change of perspective comes when Moses sees God face-to-face, as recorded in the Pearl of Great Price. Moses beholds the Glory of the Lord--just how far reaching and eternal is the One without beginning of days and end of years. He learns about the Only Begotten and how all time collapses into an eternal present with God. And then the Lord shows Moses a view of the big picture; in some kind of kaleidoscope of time he apprehends the history of the world and all the children of men in a moment. The grandeur of this vista leads Moses to exclaim, “Now…I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.”<a href="#FN3">3</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this telling moment Moses changes his mind; what he “supposes” to be the truth needs to be altered, due to what he comes to know. He expresses the supposition in the past tense; he had supposed it, but with revelation he must now amend his present understanding. Suppose is a verb, meaning to assume, consider, believe or take for granted. Moses had assumed or believed a greater importance to man. It is not that man lacks value in the sight of God, for as we will learn later in the same chapter, God’s very work and His glory is focused on mankind and bringing about our eternal lives. But here Moses learns how our micro-focused world pales in comparison to the grandeur of God and His works. Moses moves from a mortally delimited focus to an eternal one.</p>
<p>In the scriptures, whenever the writer uses the term “suppose,” it denotes a mistaken assumption or a belief ultimately revealed as false. Here are few instructive examples. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob explains how the learned “…hearken not unto the counsel of God…supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and profiteth them not…”<a href="#FN4">4</a> Nephi describes Laban’s confusion when “… he supposed (him) to be his master…”<a href="#FN5">5</a> Likewise, to Olivery Cowdry, who desired the gift of translation, the Lord admonished, “…you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was asked to me.” <a href="#FN6">6</a> In the New Testament we see Paul affirm to Timothy, that corrupt minds, “…supposing that gain is godliness…”<a href="#FN7">7</a> need to be avoided. A most powerful realization when what is normal proves otherwise, is when the resurrected Lord appears to His disciples. They are terrified and frightened, and “…supposed that they had seen a Spirit.”<a href="#FN8">8</a> Most of our suppositions come from experience, and their experience did not lend itself to perceive a resurrected being. Can we blame them really, that they struggled with recognizing the Christ? &nbsp;I don’t think we should attribute to them a lack of faith, as if we wouldn’t have responded this way. “…and they believed not for joy…”<a href="#FN9">9</a> -- this was just too good to be true – they doubted they should feel this happy! &nbsp;And in this they “wondered.” &nbsp;Then, he confirmed His corporeal reality to them and their false supposition faded away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That our suppositions often prove wrong is humbling. We suppose a great deal. At least I catch myself too often entrapped by such assumptions. Part of our growth accompanies a willingness to adjust our conclusions, to discard them if necessary, and to align ourselves more fully with the Lord’s vision and His will. Our human understanding will inevitably prove wrong, or at least limited. Humility requires us to recognize limits to our perspectives. The prophet Isaiah clearly understood this human predicament when he so elegantly related these revelatory words, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.”<a href="#FN10">10</a> Well of course, but in our mortal hubris we often fail to recognize just how stuck we are, and we need a reminder that God occupies a relative position to the truth different from our own; His vantage point, as the omniscient and Eternal Father, provides an alternative to our earthly myopic view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When Nephi was organizing all his plates for reasons he knew not, he inserts an interesting interlude into his narrative, he offers “…the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men…”<a href="#FN11">11</a> It seems God makes preparations for the collective as well as the deeply personal. We can trust He possesses a more totalizing view, and it would be to our benefit to somehow obtain a sense of just what that may be. I encourage us to reflect on those most precious and poignant moments when we received a glimpse of God unfolding His purposes.</p>
<p>When I was a missionary in the Marshall Islands long ago, I, along with my Samoan companion, Tuiletefuga, were initiating the work in a small, but historically significant village on Majuro Atoll. We had been working hard to learn the language upon our arrival and to establish positive relationships in the village, especially with the high ranking individuals. Our work was progressing slowly and in fact, we had become the target of some persecution that moved from verbal taunts to stones thrown at us as we rode our bikes at night on the dirt trails, and even attempts to use sorcery against us. My very robust and towering companion had little patience with such gestures, and I had some curious event filled moments ensuring he did not exact corporal punishment upon our antagonists (and he would have done so with vigor and efficiency I have no doubt). During this time of un-ease in the village we began teaching an old man, Labwujtok Lane, who as the son of a paramount chief held significant title and rank. We had baptized his wife some months before and she was numbered among our three congregants. We met often with Labwujtok, teaching him all the lessons at least four times over a six-month period. We considered taking him off our teaching list, nonetheless we would call on him for friendly visits and attend to him as he was quickly deteriorating with severe diabetes. During this time, the infections necessitated amputating his right leg just above the knee.</p>
<p>We prayed for Labwujtok, not just that he would come to accept gospel truths, but for comfort in the waning days of his mortality. Then one morning, we rode our bikes out to his compound, and when we called through the door he enthusiastically invited us into his hut to sit on mats next to him. He told us, “Elders, I had a dream the night before last, that I was outside my house near the trail leading towards the lagoon. People in white clothing were passing by me headed toward the lagoon. When I stopped them to ask what they were doing, they told me they were going to be baptized. So I followed them to the shore. Thousands of people were standing on the beach in white clothing, and as I pressed through the crowd I could see a man standing in the water, baptizing one person after another. When I asked who it was they told me it was the Apostle Peter. I was curious for which church he was baptizing, and they answered it was for the true church of Christ. And then I awoke wondering about the dream and which Church was that of Christ. Then last night I dreamed again, and it was the same dream. I followed the people in white down to the shore, and I asked again who was doing the baptizing. This time I was told it was Moroni, that he too had the power to baptize for the true Church of Christ. And then I awoke, and I knew then you young Mormon missionaries had this same authority and the true Church was on the earth. You will see, thousands will come to be baptized.”</p>
<p>Two days later we carried Labwujtok down into the water of the lagoon. Because he could not stand or walk, Tuiletefuga and I made a cradle with our arms interlocked, and setting him upon it we descended into the water. A senior missionary performed the ordinance. We then submerged Labwujtok by both of us squatting down and immersing under the water with him. We confirmed him at the water’s edge. A week later, we sat and prayed with him, until he died. I could not help but think of the words of the prophet Joel, that in the latter-days your “…old men shall dream dreams…”<a href="#FN12">12</a> At the time I could only grasp a semblance of what this event may mean. But after this experience with Labwujtok the persecution stopped, and we began to teach, baptizing many converts every month, a pattern that continues to this day. When I was a missionary there were only four to six missionaries in all the Marshall Islands, and we were 2300 miles from the mission home in Guam. Today, a mission headquarters for the Marshall Islands and Kiribati is located on this atoll, and the first stake from the old Micronesia mission was organized there with thousands of members. The Lord had His time-table and His purposes for which He prepared a way. I had supposed that our missionary labors were stuck, that the people would not be receptive due to certain traditions and an entrenched Christianity. I had supposed wrong, but was allowed to peer into the Lord’s way of bringing about His purposes in His time.</p>
<p>We are not left to grapple alone with our suppositions. The Lord imparts ways for us to see into His world, to look over His shoulder if you will, to gain something of His perspective. The scriptures provide a record of His words and those of prophets. These words help us rise above our finite and limited thoughts, and we would do well to note the echoed truths spoken through the mouths of His servants. Many hold the popular view that prophesy tells of the future, portending major human events or the prediction of things to come, including things as banal as stock market prognostications or who a celebrity will marry. Tucked away in a footnote, the myth scholar Lewis Hyde provides a more insightful truth, that a prophet does not so much portend the unknown future, but “…speaks of things that will be true in the future because they are true in all times. The prophet disrupts the mundane in order to reveal the eternal.”<a href="#FN13">13</a> We need to allow prophets to disrupt us from our mundane thought routines, to consider more attentively the eternal.</p>
<p>The Lord also offers us perspective through the Holy Ghost. To learn and follow the Spirit obliges us to be quiet, to shut off the invasive distractions of the world, and then to trust, as Nephi did, to be “…led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things that I should do.”<a href="#FN14">14</a> To be lead in such a manner requires us to set aside our normal expectations and assumptions, to be open to consider and act upon things we have never considered, to glimpse “…things as they really are, and of things as they really will be…”<a href="#FN15">15</a> -- those thrilling “ah ha” moments when we know we are aligned with the splendid and the true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also catch sight of God’s thought world through the temple. In the temple we step out from mundane linear time to enter timelessness, we remove ourselves from the everyday profane space to enter sacred space, to connect with the axis mundi -- the center or navel of the universe, where heaven and earth meet. In the temple we rise above a temporal view to see ourselves as part of a grander story. We are reminded of the big picture by rehearsing the order of the cosmos and God’s deliberate designs. We see ourselves in relationship to the divine, to eternity, and make far reaching covenants that bind us to God and each other. The temple holds the “…key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.” This is not just knowledge about God, but a portion of His knowledge -- via the “…ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.”<a href="#FN16">16</a> The temple disrupts our faulty suppositions and links us profoundly as consecrated saints, who in seeking to know and understand, align our lives in accordance with God’s higher ways. This then provides a script we should take with us, indeed we must take with us, into the world as we exit His sacred theater.</p>
<p>There is great danger with being absorbed in the present, whether for pleasure or when consumed by anxiety or suffering. We need to withdraw from the immediacy of the moment, to see the larger context, to “…let the solemnities of eternity rest upon (our) minds.”<a href="#FN17">17</a> The temple provides a context for such meditations, including how there is something profoundly sacred about consecrated suffering, the Savior’s and our own. The temple raises some profound considerations about time. In mortality our experience with time is both rooted in nature and how cultures configure its cycles and patterns. In our modern lives we often limit our ability to see outside the immediacy and micro-focus of individual experience. Recognizing how God works deliberately through and across whole dispensations of time, and how sacred story and ceremony provide an exit from our insular experiences in time, I wish to adumbrate on those wonderful and personal surprises when the Lord weaves together earthly time and eternity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, when I was a missionary, in the same village I referred to above, I came to know everyone. I remained there for a year and half with a total of two companions. After the experience with Labwujtok our teaching efforts accelerated. We were teaching a man named Amima Alik whose wife and some of his daughters had already joined the Church. Amima knew the truthfulness of the restored gospel but retained some personal challenges to overcome. But once he did, he became a backbone to the Church in the village. During one discussion we were considering eternal families and sealing ordinances. As we sat on mats in his humble home one evening, with a small wicker kerosene lamp providing light, he looked upon our picture of a beautiful temple, and he ruminated out loud, that such a blessing he could never realize. As a school teacher, he earned a little more money than some in the village, but he still greatly supplemented his subsistence by fishing and farming. His total annual salary was barely enough to buy two plane tickets to Hawai’i, and then how would they live for the rest of the year? All I could do was kindly submit that somehow, someday, he would be sealed to his wife. But honestly, I supposed I was offering an unrealistic hope to smooth over a moment of resignation.</p>
<p>This discussion was over 33 years ago. A few years back Elaine and I received a phone call from the temple to come up to help with some new patrons from the Marshall Islands who had just arrived. I felt pressed for time with my university and church responsibilities, but sensed I needed to somehow make arrangements to go. The temple president asked if I would interpret from English to Marshallese in the initiatory area for the new male Marshallese patrons. When I passed through the curtain to assist with the first brother I immediately stopped still, this man gazed up at me with a huge smile that quickly turned to tears. It was Amima. As he received the first part of this sacred ordinance I tried to interpret for him in his language, but I could barely utter the words through my tears and choking voice. Amima was shaking and wiping his eyes. The ordinance worker was puzzled, but knew something special was going on. In that moment I witnessed the power of unified souls, and we both knew God had given us a gift, that he had brought two points of time together, so we could both see his hand in this great tapestry of weaving together his purposes for the benefit of individual souls. For the remainder of the endowment Elaine and I aided as escorts for this great couple, and then, I served as a witness to their sealing as a couple and family. Time, temple and perspective, it all came together powerfully in the due time of the Lord.</p>
<p>It is not easy as we wait upon the Lord; it requires us to “…submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.”<a href="#FN18">18</a> And then patience leads to a measure of clarity. I have been thinking lately about Joseph, the son of Jacob. It appears he was a spoiled child, a bit precocious and annoying really. Indeed, he was the favored one. And then his life took a seemingly tragic turn. This story unfolds over many years: his brothers sold him into slavery, he became the servant to Potiphar, and when he rejects a wife’s lust, she falsely accuses him and they cast him into jail. But he rises from his adverse circumstances again, interprets the butler’s and baker’s dreams, is forgotten, interprets Pharaoh’s dream, finds his way into Pharaoh’s trust, and becomes the governor of the land. Because we know the end from the beginning we see in this story the Lord working things out for Joseph’s whole family and even a civilization to come, all the while Joseph was doing his part to work things out the best he could. He ultimately saves his family, and in that affecting moment when he reveals his identity, he tellingly proclaims, “…ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.”<a href="#FN19">19</a> In his worst days Joseph may not have had such clarity, but through his perseverance and patience, he gained this profound insight on how God works. There is healing, reconciliation, and realization in unexpected ways. We know not how it will work out, and the seemingly delayed or circuitous route of the Lord will unfold in time and in a manner we may not suppose, and may I propose, in ways that will prove delightfully surprising.</p>
<p>May I also offer, the Lord is not only patient with us as we exercise our agency, but he lets us work our own salvation in a diverse set of personal circumstances; He gives us ample room to make our own unique way. Sometimes we seem to want to insist upon the Lord that He provide a spiritual confirmation for a singular path we should take. There is an instructive moment in D&amp;C 61. This is when Joseph Smith and his companions were traveling between Missouri and Kirtland, Ohio. There was some consideration about the course of travel and potential dangers. And then the Lord discloses an unexpected truth, “And it mattereth not unto me, after a little while, if it so be they fill their mission, whether they go by water or by land; let it be as it is made known unto them according to their judgments hereafter.”<a href="#FN20">20</a> The course was less important; it was the destination that mattered. It is not always the route to get there, but that we get there. If returning to the God’s presence or Zion, is our mission or destination, and this is what really matters to us, then how we get there may be open to more diversity than we think. Sometimes we may suppose there is only one course of study or career path, or a single person to marry, or one way only to get the Lord’s work done. If there is a truly unfavorable or just wrong choice, or one out of harmony with revealed truth and the commandments, then we would do well to heed the warning or stupor of thought. But perhaps we fail often to appreciate that there is more than one good choice, and the Lord allows us to use our able judgment to choose among good things. You decide, and then make it right (the career path, the spouse, means of service), and the Lord will consecrate your choice for you.</p>
<p>And now back to my ward member Brady, who waded through so much affliction with the tragic deaths of his parents and sister. Together we found solace in Joseph Smith’s experience in Liberty Jail, when things were not going well at all for Joseph and the saints. We find in D&amp;C 121 a confessional lapse for Joseph. He is basically complaining, and asking, “When? When will you come through for us Lord?” Then the intensity breaks with soothing revelatory words, “My son, peace be unto they soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment. And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high….”<a href="#FN21">21</a> These comforting words, that tendered an alternative perspective, were a balm to Brady’s soul.</p>
<p>President Monson poses these honest words, “None of us makes it through this life without problems or challenges….”<a href="#FN22">22</a> and then echoes the Savior, “Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you and will stand by you…”<a href="#FN23">23</a> As we wrestle with our messy suppositions and wonder how to endure our lonely mortal challenges, may we remember how the Christ exhibits a most penetrating motivation, “…the world…shall judge (or suppose) him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and long suffering towards the children of men.”<a href="#FN24">24&nbsp;</a></p>

http://devotional.byuh.edu/media160816<br><title>Reaching our Personal Summits of Spiritual and Secular Education | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>16 August 2016<br />Debbie Hippolite Wright<br />Vice President for Student Development and Services, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters Aloha,</p>
<p>I pray that today we might be united through the Spirit and that individually the Spirit will impress upon our minds the message the Lord wants us to personally hear. I know our lives will be edified if we act upon personal promptings from the Lord.</p>
<p>I want you students to think back to your first week at BYU-Hawaii attending New Student Orientation. For some of you it may be as recent as three weeks ago, or perhaps a couple of years ago, but the message remains true and constant for us all. The President’s Official Welcome event is where members of the administration, Hawaiian Studies program, Student Association leaders, and advisors engage in a ritual of encounter - a chant – to welcome all new and returning students. “Hiki Mai” was written by the respected Latter-day Saint Kupuna Cy Bridges; the words were deeply inspired by our Heavenly Father for each one of us. We call to the newest and youngest members of our university Ohana these words of encouragement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hiki Mai-Hawaiian words</p>
<p>“come forward and appear you precious flowers (or young ones)… each of you are taking up the challenge of not simply climbing a high mountain but you have chosen to climb the highest and most majestic mountain of all…You are the most precious adornment (lei) worn around the neck of your ancestors. Come forward come forward for there are many roads for you to choose. Be sure to follow the voice of the Good Shepherd, for he will always keep you, protect you and show you the way.” (Translation by Cy Bridges)</p>
<p>Then it is you the incoming students who unite your voices with those of the chanters standing before you and together we sing, “Aloha e, Aloha e, Aloha e” Hiki Mai is a welcome chant of love sung with love.</p>
<p>In my own Maori culture of Aotearoa, New Zealand a vital component of the rituals of encounter is the Karanga or a welcome call from an older woman of position from the hosting tribe. The Karanga welcomes visitors but also makes clear what the objectives for the relationship will be for the duration they are together. Anciently this was to avoid mishap and possibly war from arising between tribes because of miscommunication, misuse of hospitality, violations of tribal customs and so forth. My devotional talk today is my Karanga to you; it is a personal greeting of love and welcome, but it also conveys admonitions from the host people of this institution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My perspective is not a common one. I first came to BYU Hawaii as a brand new freshman, only a teenager. I cried myself to sleep the first night in the dorms. I felt alone without friends and missing my large noisy family—it was the first time away from home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a faculty member for many years I relished being in the company of students who were some of the smartest, most humble, kind and spiritual people I have met. Faculty here feel a solemn responsibility to see that their teaching is high quality, the courses and material are relevant, and students are engaged in their learning outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now as an administrator, current responsibilities allow me to collaborate with dedicated professionals on policy and procedural matters which impact the health and well-being of students within legal parameters. All the while upholding the gospel values foundational to our institution within the rapidly changing environment of higher education. Each opportunity I have had here at BYU Hawaii has challenged me and brought unique blessings and miracles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this year’s Faculty and Staff meeting President John S. Tanner made this statement: “this is our moment in time to be here at BYU-Hawaii.” Then he framed a powerful question which I echo today, how will you take advantage of this moment in time? Do you know why the Lord wants you here? Will you squeeze out as much good from this experience as you can?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admonition One: Prioritize Spiritual Education&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Hiki mai chant the mountain referred to is education; in the scriptures mountains are symbolic of temples where we obtain the highest form of education. The words in Hiki mai invite us not simply to climb a high mountain but to climb the highest mountain, where those who are worthy ascend and receive the greater spiritual knowledge. There are many scriptural examples of the Lord giving guidance and subsequent promises to his people on top of a high mountain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Mt. Sanai Moses received explicit instruction from the Lord and great promises if the children of Israel would do what they were commanded. <a href="#FN1">[1]</a> The brother of Jared had done all that he could do to figure out an answer to his barge lighting problem before he asked the Lord on Mt. Shelem for the solution he could not figure out for himself--to make the stones emit light. <a href="#FN2">[2]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are homesick or facing difficulties whether they be financial, grasping academic concepts, roommate or family concerns you cannot resolve on your own, the House of the Lord is a place for peace, refuge, and answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson has said, “until you have entered the house of the Lord and have received all the blessings which await you there, you have not obtained everything the Church has to offer. The all-important and crowning blessings of membership in the Church are those blessings which we receive in the temples of God. <a href="#FN3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Do you accept the challenge to climb the highest mountain of all? Or will you settle comfortably at base camp at the foot of the mountain?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen to the blessings, found in D&amp;C 109:22, that apply to the acquisition of this type of learning; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“And we ask thee, Holy Father that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them.” <a href="#FN4">[4]</a></p>
<p>What glorious blessings, to go forth armed with the Lord’s power, to be endowed with his name (and all which that entails), and to be in the watchful care of angels-truly worth climbing the highest mountain! I know this promise is sure.</p>
<p>Admonition Two: Be Guided by the Spirit</p>
<p>It has been said that, “you face the world at its worst”. <a href="#FN5">[5]</a> Some of you may be navigating complex terrain given what the world is throwing at you, but those who have gone before you call out encouragement to accept the challenge and continue onward and upward. You can be triumphant even if you trip and fall. There is no doubt that there are many roads for you to choose, but you are here at BYU-Hawaii because you have heard the voice of the Good Shepherd through the Spirit and followed it. It is because of your love for Him that you have responded with faith. Like travelers of old who traversed the unknown, you were brought here in this wide expanse of the Pacific. Whether your homeland is a tiny island, hardly a speck on a map, or an imposing land mass, you have been called out of the world. BYU-Hawaii is an advanced leadership training program and has been charged by prophets of God to build leaders who have character and integrity and who will lead in their homes, communities, nations, and professions and in building the Kingdom of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several of you are guided daily by the Spirit in the academic area in large and small ways, for example, deciding on a major, what to read to prepare for your test, responding to the prompting not to cheat, and so on. Let me tell you about a young man who attended BYU-Hawaii a little while ago, he was a returned missionary who had served in Iceland. The Icelandic language is an incredibly difficult language to learn, but he was able to master it. After his two years were completed he enrolled here and described always having an interest in Japan - its art, language, and culture. He said, “I enrolled in Japanese 101 and thought pridefully that because I learned Icelandic I would be able to learn Japanese easily.”</p>
<p>However after a month the young man described himself as being at the bottom of the class. “Nothing seemed to stick to my mind, and when it finally did I was so far behind the rest of the class, I almost felt like withdrawing and taking the bad mark on my record.” He went on to say he was sitting in the library one day and he felt like he should pray. He spoke to the Lord and asked Him to help him learn Japanese. He uttered this tender plea, “Thou helped me learn Icelandic to bless others in Iceland, if thou would help me learn Japanese I will use it for whatever purposes thou would have me do in thy service.” The impression that came was that he should study the Book of Mormon in Japanese and study it in the same format that he did Icelandic. The words, characters and pronunciation came faster than they did relying on his own abilities. The purpose of the class changed; rather than the reward at the end of the class of a good grade, it was to prepare to serve the Lord and his children.</p>
<p>In an address to Church Education System educators Elder Bednar said, “It is in the sincerity and consistency of our faith-inspired action that we indicate to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, our willingness to learn and receive instruction from the Holy Ghost”. <a href="#FN6">[6]</a> &nbsp;As we consistently keep our commitments even our honor commitments we are acting in faith and can be taught by the true teacher, the Spirit of our Heavenly Father. <a href="#FN7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Education is designed to enlarge and develop powers of the spirit and educate you for eternity…you prepare to make a living, but more important still, you prepare to live toward perfection, toward exaltation, and toward Godhood.” Spencer W. Kimball</p>
<p>Admonition Three: Keep your Commitments</p>
<p>A newly married sister in a student ward once shared with me that she had been called as the pianist in her ward. She humbly confided in me saying, “I’m not very good, but I told the Bishop I would do it.” She went on to explain that she spent her Saturdays practicing hymns on the piano, so she would be prepared for sacrament meeting the following day. To show her dedication she would spend a minimum of four hours, and sometimes many more, each Saturday searching for an unoccupied piano on campus, so she could rehearse hymns until she was satisfied that her playing would help set the proper tone for the coming Sabbath meetings. &nbsp;Her seemingly simple commitment was taken seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Before coming to BYU-Hawaii you made commitments that involved promising to keep various covenants and I invite you to humbly review these and never to become complacent in your efforts to fulfill them. Keeping them in the forefront of our mind and heart helps us to live in agreement with the Lord’s commandments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon signing the Honor Code, we reaffirm our commitments as Latter-day Saints to keep the commandments, to maintain standards of honesty, to be modest in dress and grooming, and to uphold university policies. We also promise to be actively engaged in our wards, to fulfill Church callings and assignments, and to assist others to do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wherefore be not weary in well doing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great” <a href="#FN8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Elder M. Russell Ballard encouraged that even though;</p>
<p>“Sometimes we are tempted to let our lives be governed more by convenience than by covenant. It is not always convenient to live gospel standards and stand up for truth…But there is no spiritual power in living by convenience. The power comes as we keep our covenants.” <a href="#FN9">[9]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admonition Four: Don’t Give Up, Don’t you Dare</p>
<p>Several years ago our family lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, for a short time, and while there, I served in the Young Women program in our ward. It was a profound learning and growing experience for me. One of my most vivid and memorable experiences was participating in a hike with the Olympus 7th ward Young Women. The chosen hike was the summit of Mt. Aire in Millcreek Canyon. Our guide was a sister in the ward, named Amy, who was a trained search and rescue professional who would lead us and ensure that we would safely reach our destination and also return home safely that afternoon. When this hike was proposed I thought to myself, “it’s a convenient location, with the trailhead only about a 15 minute drive from our house – how challenging could it be?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the relatively close proximity to civilization, the expected duration for the hike was only about two hours and again I figured, (for a novice hiker), that seemed reasonable. How bad could a two hour trek be? The girls were enthusiastic and eager to listen to Amy as she provided information about appropriate hiking clothing and shoes. She also reminded us to carry a light jacket and gave us a suggested quantity of water we should bring. Although it seemed like an inordinate amount to haul, I thought it best to comply since she was an expert and knew what she was talking about, but I couldn’t help ask myself, “how much is that water going weigh?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I learned about Mt. Aire during the hike. First off it should be called Mt. “No Air” or Mt. “Give Me Oxygen.” This is due to the fact that the summit is about 8,600 feet above sea level. For comparison sake, the Koolau Mountain Range here around us rises to a height of approximately 3,000 feet above sea level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the base of Mt Aire to the summit is a vertical climb of 2,000 feet. For those of us from sea level, a hike to over 8,000 feet in altitude presents very noticeable changes. You quickly observe a lack of available oxygen and the thinning of the air makes you feel out of shape, lethargic, and light-headed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share what I remember most about that mountainous climb. The 16 and 17 year old Laurels started out in front with Amy and stayed up with her all the way. They set a grueling pace for the rest of us (well for me). They seemed as sure footed as mountain goats, steady on their feet and moving with ease and elegance. Periodically they would stop to let the remainder of the group catch up, rest, and take a sip of water. It was easy to see they were more experienced and comfortable not only with the terrain but with themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the hike I started somewhere in the middle of the pack but as it got steeper the air grew thinner. It became more difficult for me to fill my lungs with oxygen, but no one else seemed affected like I was. I tried to pretend everything was OK, but I started breathing through my nose and mouth to force more oxygen in to my lungs. Each step became more laborious, and I was preoccupied with looking for a place I could stop for a few seconds to catch my breath. I was not engaging in conversation or appreciating the majestic scenery for which the Utah canyon-scapes are famous. I was focused on staying alive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the while the Beehive girls flitted around checking out the flora and fauna like they were romping in a field of daisies laughing and having a wonderful time—you know the awe and joy that God’s creations hold. They were having a blast with not a care in the world. Not wanting to spoil their fun I waved the girls on, and they ran up ahead to join their friends but then a few minutes later they ran back to check on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One little girl said, “would you like me to carry your jacket sister Wright?” I thanked her and told her I was fine. At one point my daughter who could see I was having a difficult time came up behind me put two hands on the small of my back and pushed me until I felt a renewed commitment and energy to push to the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This little beehive group stayed with me and stood around me as I caught my breath. Although I invited them to go ahead, in part because I was embarrassed at having such a hard time, but I couldn’t shake them loose. They kept on chatting with each other and moved along the trail slower than they could have but not so far ahead that I had an excuse to call out “I’ll wait for you here pick me up on your way down.” So in the end I buckled down and decided I wasn’t going to give up. Instead, I continued to focus on putting one foot in front of the other and then continued with each successive step, and so on until we reached the Summit where the trail blazing Laurels and leaders had finished their rest and were ready to head back down the mountain. All I could think of was, “I made it!” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Never give up. Reach out for help to your bishop, home teachers, professors and tutors. You can make it.</p>
<p>In his December 2011 Commencement address entitled “The Parable of BYU-Hawaii” Elder Jeffrey R. Holland stated that:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“for Latter-day Saints in general and BYU–Hawaii students in particular, there should be no blur in the vision of what is humanly possible. We of all people should not be guilty of living under our moral capacity, or, as Brigham Young regularly phrased it, “liv[ing] far beneath our privileges” (Journal of Discourses 12:104). I am saying, in short, that if you have an inferiority complex, get over it. We all start humbly, we all start with feelings of inadequacy, we all think the fellow seated on our right and the woman seated on our left are more talented, are more gifted, had wealthier beginnings than we do, and are going to do better in life than we ever will. Well, they aren’t, and they don’t, and they won’t! They are just like you. We all have our fears and insecurities, and so do those people on your right and on your left… But it would be fatal to stay in that swamp of insecurity, to mire down and stop, to fail to look up and fail to look ahead and fail to be believing.” <a href="#FN10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The Savior has overcome all things we might experience. He remained true to the spiritual knowledge he had of his Father’s plan; he was committed to the cause he volunteered for in the pre-existence; and he never gave up in the face of incredible obstacles and opposition - a perfect example for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each one of us here at BYUH has the capacity to be successful to make it to the end. The end does not simply mean graduation. But if you take full advantage of the holistic education you can receive here, what you learn will set a pattern that will guide the course of your life, and it can help you gain eternal life to live again in the presence of our Heavenly Father and our older brother and Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can fulfill this goal and reach our personal summits, but please make reaching these summits a team effort. Each of us will require help from our loving family, ecclesiastical leaders, wise mentors, those who have gone before us, and those who are walking the path with us. Remember our Lord is mindful of each one of our trials and our triumphs and we can always rely on Him. I so testify.</p>

<p>August 9, 2016<br />Jeff Caneen<br />Associate Professor of Hospitality and Tourism <br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha brothers and sisters. Thank you Brother Preece for the introduction and for your friendship. Thank you President Tanner for providing me with this opportunity to formally say goodbye to the BYU-Hawaii community.</p>
<p>As Brother Preece mentioned, this is my final semester here at BYU-Hawaii, and in November I will be leaving Laie. I want to begin by acknowledging the profound effect that this university and this community have had on my life. While perhaps not yet a realized latter-day Zion, still I have met, worked with, been mentored and befriended by many truly Christ-like men and women during my 20-year tour of duty here in paradise. I thank God for bringing me here and allowing me to serve here for these years. I love this place.</p>
<p>I grew up in a non-member family less than 50 miles from the Hill Cumorah in Palmyra, New York. In those days there were very few Mormons in and around the birthplace of the Church. So few members that the Hill Cumorah stake to which I belonged encompassed the entire state of New York. I didn’t know any Mormons. I knew nothing at all of the church. To the extent that I had even heard of the word “Mormon”, I assumed it was an “old timey” Christian sect, kind of like the Amish. I guess I wasn’t the only one, because when I told my friends that I had joined the Mormon church, they said “well what are you doing here? Where are your clothes?” They apparently thought I should be plowing fields in a straw hat behind a team of horses.</p>
<p>I was at the time a young married adult working as an apprentice butcher when Utah Elders Sullivan and Lemon knocked on my door in the winter of 1968. It seems amazing to me in retrospect that I let them in. I wasn’t a religious person. Hadn’t grown up in a religious family. Wasn’t deep enough to be searching for the meaning of life. I don’t think that anyone thought I was a particularly promising young man. I was kinda like Rocky, just another bum in the neighborhood - an unlikely conversion prospect for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Elder Sullivan and Elder Lemon were both about my age. And they obviously WERE promising and impressive young men. They befriended me and taught me. I didn’t know anything about the scriptures or doctrine or apostasy or restoration. But I loved and trusted the elders and I believed what they told me. The spirit testified to me in a very subtle way. I gained the tiny seed of a testimony, gave up my sins, (at least the ones I recognized as sins at the time) and was baptized. Again in retrospect I marvel that I opened the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I became part of a very small branch on the Cattaraugus Indian reservation – which coincidentally was the location of the very first missionary effort of the restored church. In 1968 the branch consisted of 4 active priesthood holders and about a dozen Indian women and their children. As the only male convert in their living memory, I was kind of a celebrity in the branch, and the branch family eventually convinced me that I had potential that could only be realized by going to college at BYU. So about 8 months after joining the church I became a freshman at BYU in Provo.</p>
<p>I loved everything about BYU. There for the first time, I developed a real love of learning that has stayed with me since. But being there was also a spiritual challenge that I did not fully comprehend at the time. I had what I thought was a testimony. I was “somebody” among the saints of the Cattaraugus Branch. I was pretty happy and satisfied with myself. But in Provo I felt constantly inferior to my Wymount Terrace neighbors, all of whom were lifelong members and returned missionaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lived in married student housing. I was just 19. Most of these guys (my neighbors) were 6, 8 or 10 years older than me. When the men in my student ward bore their powerful testimonies, and told of their missionary experiences, I began to question my own testimony. Did I really KNOW BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT that the church was true? I thought it was. But I had had no miraculous experiences, no discernible burning in the bosom. I didn’t have this more mature, more developed kind of a testimony that I witnessed at BYU. I really didn’t measure up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was losing confidence in my own testimony. I didn’t understand the doctrine and concept of progression. I just thought the other guys were more worthy than me. I thought God loved them more. I did not have a vision of the next steps available to me. And I especially did not grasp my obligation to act and not simply wait to be acted upon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know from talking to students here at BYU-Hawaii over the years that many of you (though certainly not all) feel this same kind of spiritual inferiority. I want you to know that its not inferiority at all. It’s a plateau. You’re stuck. I want to help you understand how to move on. Sometimes I’ve been a slow learner in life. It took me a long time to figure this out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like to think of the mortal portion of our eternal progression as consisting of steps or stages. I think of the first two steps as: testimony and conversion. I also sometimes think of these stages as: clean hands and pure heart. Ideally we move continually upward from one stage to the next as we strive to keep our second estate. But for most of us, we get stuck somewhere along the way. We plateau – sometimes for many years. We will maximize our joy in this life if we can get unstuck and move on. But to do so, we need to act. I’d like to use the life of the apostle Peter to illustrate.</p>
<p>Peter is consistently portrayed in the scriptures as enthusiastic and impetuous. When you see a Hollywood portrayal of Peter, he’s always a serious old gray beard of angelic demeanor. But I think of Peter as young, idealistic and excited. He’s like a lot of you. It’s interesting to me that while God loves us all he consistently chooses this character type to lead the dispensations of his kingdom. I see Joseph Smith for example as being a personality much like Peter.</p>
<p>I hope I don’t offend anyone by suggesting that both Peter and Joseph Smith were spiritual entrepreneurs. What is an entrepreneur (other than a word no one can spell)? While we normally think of business entrepreneurs, we also speak of non-business people as being entrepreneurial - and by that we mean that in some context such people are full of determination, willing to take risks, they crave personal progress, they are resilient in the face of failure, passionate about the enterprise, and adaptable. The savior’s parable of the unjust steward in Luke chapter 16 suggests that our Lord wants us to be entrepreneurial in our spiritual progression.</p>
<p>The parable tells about a business manager who is about to get fired by his boss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In anticipation he comes up with a plan to get other people to take care of him after he gets fired. He scrambles around trying to find ways to succeed in terms of worldly wealth displaying many of the traits of an entrepreneur – although ultimately he uses dishonest means (which is not entrepreneurial). Still despite &nbsp;the apparent dishonesty, when his master finds out about it, he COMMENDS the dishonest manager – meaning he tells him “atta boy – good job”. Then Jesus explains:</p>
<p>“for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light” <a href="#FN1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Meaning that the Lord recognizes how resourceful and entrepreneurial we are in terms of our worldly welfare, but that we don’t dedicate the same kind of effort and passion to our spiritual progression and the resulting “true riches”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it. You understand that to get a good job or to buy a house or to start a business you will be willing to scramble around and use a lot of energy and ingenuity to achieve your goal. Are you willing to approach your spiritual progression in the same way? Or will you plateau with your “young” testimony, trying to be obedient, most of the time, even though it’s hard?</p>
<p>The Lord said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would that thou wert cold or hot. So that because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” <a href="#FN2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs may be many things, but they are never lukewarm. Peter was a spiritual entrepreneur, so was Joseph Smith, so I think are all those who make good progress in the second estate. They are full of determination, passionate, resilient, and adaptable. They are not satisfied to sit on a plateau – not moving forward. They act. They don’t sit on their plateau waiting to be acted upon.</p>
<p>Back to Peter: Peter and his brother Andrew had been disciples of John the Baptist. Brother Andrew was present when John declared of Jesus that he was the Lamb of God. Then Andrew went to Peter and told him “we have found the messiah”. Later Jesus passed by the two brothers fishing and said: “follow me and I will make you fishers of men”. The scriptures say that Peter STRAIGHTWAY left his nets and followed him. Peter immediately gave up his former life to follow Jesus – he acted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, after having spent some time following Jesus and hearing him teach and observing Him, Peter developed and bore his testimony. The savior asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God”. <a href="#FN3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Peter had a testimony – a strong one, but his progress was just beginning. The Lord had much more in store for Peter, as he does for you.</p>
<p>I want you to understand that a testimony of Jesus Christ and of his restored church is not our objective. Even Satan and his followers have testimonies:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thou believest there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble”. <a href="#FN4">[4]</a></p>
<p>But the devils are not saved. A testimony is necessary, but not sufficient. It can become a plateau. It is a prerequisite to our goal of becoming one with our Heavenly Father and his son Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what’s the next step? And how do we take it? We gain a testimony when the Holy Ghost testifies to us that Christ lives and that he loves us. That testimony, that love motivates us to obey God’s commandments. Obedience is required to take the next step. I don’t think in the end that we obey out of fear that we’ll be cast down to hell. We obey out of love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We love him because he first loved us”. <a href="#FN5">[5]</a></p>
<p>We fear God in that we dread disappointing the one we so dearly love. Fasting, prayer, practice, and determination will help increase our obedience. You will not be able to move to the next level until you are obedient to God’s commandments. You know the ones you’re having trouble with. Work on those. Become obedient. But even then, obedience itself is NOT the goal. It’s just another prerequisite. To be obedient is to have clean hands. We also need to develop a pure heart.</p>
<p>The next step is what in this talk I am calling conversion. It is also spoken in scripture as being born again, the mighty change, purification, or sanctification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to Peter: He gave up his nets and followed Jesus for three years, witnessing His miracles, hearing His teachings, sharing His life. Surely he was obedient to all the Lord commanded of him. He had even experienced the transfiguration in which, modern prophets have revealed, Peter was ordained a prophet, seer and revelator and given the keys for his dispensation. Certainly, no one could have had a stronger testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And yet – he was not converted. As late as the very last evening of the Savior’s mortal life occurred the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you. … But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, (indicating it had not yet happened) strengthen thy brethren.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.” <a href="#FN6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Certainly these were not, from the perspective of Peter, idle words. He sincerely meant what he said but would act otherwise. <a href="#FN7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Later that night, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus prophesied to His disciples,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.” Peter again responded, “Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the Master soberly prophesied, “Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.” To which Peter responded more vehemently, “If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise.” <a href="#FN8">[8]</a></p>
<p>We all know that Peter did in fact deny the savior not withstanding his great testimony and his valiance, and that upon realizing what he had done, he wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Now sometimes, when people lack confidence and feel they can’t make it, or that they don’t measure up in some fundamental way, instead of trying harder or running faster, they begin to coast. This leads to apathy and lack of commitment. I think this is what happened to Peter. I know it happened to me. It may be happening to you. Thus we are stuck on the plateau of testimony – never moving forward.</p>
<p>Back to Peter: On Easter morning came the resurrection followed by 40 days of teaching by the risen Lord. Peter was there. He knew he had been called to lead the church, and yet in John chapter 21 we read that several of the disciples were together in Galilee and “Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He’s going fishing?!!! After all this he’s going fishing? What’s going on? Well I think that Peter thought he had blown it. That his calling to lead the church had been invalidated by his denial of the savior – that he was unworthy – didn’t measure up – wasn’t celestial material after all. That’s when the Lord returned one last time and taught him how to move on to the next step, how to be born again, how to become a new man.</p>
<p>So Peter is out on a boat fishing with his friends when the resurrected Lord shows up on shore and tells them to throw their net on the other side of the boat. When they do and then take in a miraculous catch, the always determined, passionate Peter recognizes the man on the beach as the savior and dives in the water to swim to him, too impatient to wait for the boat. Then they all have a little picnic after which the following occurs (think about what Peter must be feeling here):</p>
<p>15 ¶So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? (meaning the fish) He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</p>
<p>16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
<p>17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
<p>18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. <a href="#FN9">[9]</a></p>
<p>What does this mean? Remember the Lord has told us that to Him all things are spiritual. I read it to mean that we are to love the Lord and submit to His will. When you are spiritually young or undeveloped you (like Peter) are willful and headstrong and you girdest yourself and go wherever you want, but when you become spiritually old or mature you will stretch out your arm and go where the Lord leads you even if you would rather not. In Peter’s case, to martyrdom. You submit your will to His. How do you get from spiritually young to spiritually old? It is a gift from God that comes to those who “lift where they stand” to quote President Uchdorf. Give God what you have. Don’t hold back, be a spiritual entrepreneur, and he will give you grace for grace until in the end He changes you or converts you into a new person.</p>
<p>Did it work for Peter? Well soon after, he was filled with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost. He never went back to fishing again as far as we know - and some relatively short time later he stood up to the same Sanhedrin that had previously terrified him and declared:&nbsp;</p>
<p>8 …Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p>
<p>9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p>
<p>10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>
<p>11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>
<p>12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
<p>13 ¶Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p>
<p>18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p>
<p>20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. <a href="#FN10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Obviously Peter was a new man. He had moved to a new level.</p>
<p>How does this happen? Why were my returned-missionary neighbors so much more spiritually advanced than I was? They had had the experience of devoting themselves totally to God, submitting themselves to Him and trusting Him. You don’t have to serve a mission to make this commitment and have this experience, but part of the brilliance of the missionary program is that it provides a vehicle and opportunity to be truly converted early in life.</p>
<p>What will conversion mean to you in your own life? Why will it bring you joy and happiness? The Book of Mormon provides an example of the fruits of conversion in Mosiah chapter 5. In the previous chapters King Benjamin gave his famous exhortation to the Nephites. Then in chapter 5 it says:</p>
<p>1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</p>
<p>2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. <a href="#FN11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Glen L. Pace “There is a vast difference between being good and doing good. Imagine how free we would be if we were able to express our true feelings through our actions rather than restraining our actions to hide our true feelings. We all should be striving for a disposition to do no evil, but to do good continually. This isn’t a resolve or a discipline; it is a disposition. We do things because we want to, not just because we know we should.” <a href="#FN12">[12]</a></p>
<p>That’s the difference between testimony and conversion. It is the difference between having clean hands and having a pure heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Tanner has challenged us all to make this a Zion University. And what is Zion? It is where the pure in heart dwell.</p>
<p>We are sons and daughters of God. He sent us here to progress and return to Him.</p>
<p>“Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;”. <a href="#FN13">[13]</a></p>
<p>The Old Testament is testimony and obedience and the law of Moses – clean hands. It is the Aaronic Priesthood. It is preparatory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New Testament is conversion, sanctification – pure heart. It is the Melchizedec Priesthood. We are meant to move from one to the next. And when we do, when we are truly converted and have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually – are we finished with our mortal progression. NO! There’s still spiritual graduate school. There’s consecration, becoming one with our Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ. But that’s a subject for another day.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters. Don’t be content – be entrepreneurial in your spiritual progression. Act. Don’t lose heart and coast. Don’t plateau. Move on. You are the youth of the noble birthright engaged in the greatest enterprise in the universe. To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>August 2, 2016<br />John S. Tanner and Susan Tanner<br />President &amp; First Lady of BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sister Tanner</p>
<p>We have been serving at BYU Hawaii now for exactly 1 year and 1 week. And, we are loving it.</p>
<p>When President Henry B. Eyring called us, he charged President Tanner to seek inspiration from Heavenly Father to know what he should do to accomplish what it was that needed to happen here. I am a witness to the many sleepless nights he spent studying and pondering and the many early mornings he spent praying to know the Lord’s will.</p>
<p>In his inaugural address last November he shared some of the revelation he received. &nbsp;He said, “I see a university that is intended to be not only ‘a school in Zion’ <a href="#FN1">[1]</a> but a Zion university—a place where people from many nations learn together in purity, peace, unity, and love. May this school savor so strongly and so sweetly of Zion that it creates an appetite in its graduates to build Zion everywhere.”</p>
<p>What is a Zion university and how can each of us do our part to establish it? (We talked about this with our employees at our ohana meetings a few days ago. We have deliberately chosen to be somewhat repetitive in our talks today, because we want the students and each of you to engage in this discussion and to become who the Lord would have us become during our time at BYU Hawaii.)</p>
<p>As John said, Zion is a place of “purity, peace, unity, and love.” It is a place, as the scriptures tell us where we are of “one heart and one mind <a href="#FN2">[2]</a> and there is “no contention in the land because of the “love of God which [dwells] in the hearts of the people” <a href="#FN3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of our prophetic mission will require living with love and unity and peace. President David O. McKay prophesied that this school would produce leaders that the world is hungering for, that from this school would go “men and women whose influence will be felt for good toward the establishment of peace internationally,” and that this college, temple, and town would “become a missionary factor, influencing not thousands, not tens of thousands, but millions of people.” For the prophetic mission of this place to be fulfilled, we will need to not only understand what Zion is, but also live as a Zion people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not easy, and we often fall short. Let me tell you, as some of you know, about our attempt at this a few weeks ago. We tried to have a Zion home in the month of July when we were tending 5 grandchildren, ages 1-7. &nbsp;We began with a Family Home Evening lesson on 3 important gospel principles, taught memorably with 3 simple Primary songs. &nbsp;The first principle was kindness, using the song, “I want to be kind to everyone, for that is right you see.” The next one was helpfulness. We sang, “When we’re helping we’re happy and we sing as we go.” And finally, obedience. “When my mother calls me, quickly I obey.” Be kind, be helpful, and be obedient. At the end of the week, we found we had not become perfect in those principles, so we taught the same lesson again. (Has that ever happened to you?)</p>
<p>How could these three principles help us create a Zion university?</p>
<p>To be kind is really to be “full of love one towards another.” This love is Christ’s love; it is charity. It suffereth long (is patient and meek); it envieth not (is not jealous or competitive); it seeks not her own (is selfless); and it is not easily provoked (is not angry, harsh, or mean). This love obliterates contention. This love is contagious; it spreads good-will and benevolence of feelings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw it in action with three of our 7-year-old granddaughters. They were making sugar cookies and being very creative. One of them said, “I am making a mermaid.” The next one said, “Oh I want to make a mermaid too.” “No!” snapped the first one. I had the idea first.” And the argument continued. I said, “Girls, let’s be kind and try to understand how each person is feeling.” Then the third granddaughter piped in, “When someone copies your idea, it is really a compliment. It means they think you are very clever, and it is a way of showing how much they love and admire you.” And those were the kind words that burst the jealous, competitive bubble that had been building, creating a Zion moment. Can we use kind words and love to dispel envy and jealousy among roommates, among colleagues, among each other?</p>
<p>On another occasion we saw charity build a Zion community. In the mission field, one of our missionaries softened many hearts. His prize possession given to him from his father before he left on his mission was a superb yellow camera. It went missing. And because of some obvious clues, he was sure that it had been stolen from him by his companion. But the Elder at fault would not admit it, and it was creating a contentious spirit, not conducive to missionary work. Finally the owner of the yellow camera said to President Tanner, “I would like my companion to have the camera. I think he needs it much more than I do. Let’s move on as if none of this has happened.” His benevolent response was “not easily provoked,” the opposite of angry, harsh or mean, spreading a blanket of charity over and smothering the fire that had ignited. Can we at this university forgive wrongs that may unfairly be put upon us?</p>
<p>It may be hardest to have charity when we are tired, angry, or feel slighted, neglected, or wronged. President Thomas S. Monson said, “Charity impels us to be: sympathetic, compassionate, merciful, to notice the unnoticed, to lighten the load of the discouraged, to be patient, to resist the impulse to be offended, resist the impulse to categorize or judge or criticize others.” So Zion is built upon our ability to be charitable, to be kind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s briefly turn to the principle of helpfulness. As President Monson says, charity impels us to “notice the unnoticed, lighten the load of the discouraged.” In my brief observations of only one year, I think this might be the principle where we are most Zion-like. &nbsp;I love what I have seen of the spirit of helpfulness on this campus. We see people selflessly reaching out in service in so many ways – being inclusive amidst diversity, tutoring others academically, cleaning up our community, professors sacrificing to help students beyond the classroom, home and visiting teachers fulfilling quiet needs, people giving a smile, an encouraging word, senior couples sharing their time and talents. &nbsp;</p>
<p>John Wesley, the 18th Century founder of Methodism may well have described our campus when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Do all the good you can,<br />By all the means you can, <br />In all the ways you can, <br />In all the places you can, <br />At all the times you can, <br />To all the people you can,<br />As long as you ever can.”</p>
<p>As President Eyring noted in the inauguration meeting, “the students you meet in the classroom or the people you meet at the PCC and the temple may not be the victims of a disaster, but they have needs you can choose to make your own. You can say, “How do you do?’ and they can feel that you really mean ‘I love you. Can I help?’” These acts of service savor of Zion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally the principle of obedience. In a Zion community we obey our covenants. We turn to Jesus Christ, always remembering him and obeying his commandments. We turn to him for forgiveness when we fall short. &nbsp;We seek him for solace when we are downtrodden. We keep the honor code because we have promised to do so. We follow his example because we are striving to do what is right. When we walk in obedience and faith in Jesus Christ we are empowered with his light and love. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have all felt his light and love. But because we are imperfect, like my grandchildren, we may periodically need to have a reminder lesson about being kind, helpful and obedient. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Becoming a Zion university, challenging as it will be, is a blessed goal, an opportunity for soul-transformation. President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “If we are to build that Zion of which the prophets have spoken and of which the Lord has given mighty promise, we must set aside our consuming selfishness. We must rise above our love for comfort and ease, and in the very process of effort and struggle, even in our extremity, we shall become better acquainted with our God.”</p>
<p>This is my plea and promise for each of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">President Tanner</p>
<p>ALOHA!</p>
<p>President Eyring declined to give me a charge when he called me to this position. &nbsp;Instead, he counseled me to get my charge from God. I remember at one point when I tried to coax him again to give some prophetic direction, he even pointed his finger heavenward and he directed me to go there for guidance.</p>
<p>Now I tried to do that. &nbsp;I prayed, we walked the campus, we talked with you, we read all I could about BYU-Hawaii, about the temple, about the PCC, about Laie. This book called “Something Wonderful”, became sort of my bible. It has many foundational talks about the University including and especially the talks by David O Mckay when the university was founded. And finally at my inauguration I sketched a vision for the university that had come to me. &nbsp;It was of a university that savors of Zion—a Zion university.</p>
<p>I was so gratified that Pres. Eyring affirmed this same vision in his inaugural remarks. He spoke about many ways that this university could and should savor of Zion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that it would be difficult to establish a Zion community here and it always has been, for Zion is an inside job:</p>
<p>“Time and again the Lord has asked his people to establish a Zion community. As always, the greatest challenge has been in the hearts of the people.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that “charity, the pure love of Christ,... will and must pervade a Zion university.”</p>
<p>He said that a Zion university would bridge the apparent conflict sometimes between academic excellence and charity. While “there will be different outcomes for each of us,” we will overcome “differences that are vertical” which may cause one person to feel superior to another.</p>
<p>President Eyring went on to say that in a Zion university “God will help us love each other so well that we will feel one another’s pains and joys as if they were our own.” And then he gave several examples of where he had tasted this savor of Zion in his experience at universities once while cleaning up flooding at Ricks College. Another time when he was here and there was flooding He said, “There was no hierarchy at that moment. Our shovels were the same.” Whether they were yelled by a president or by another person. He also glimpsed Zion while working side by side with students in research group at Stanford. He said, there “four of us had a chance to savor, for a short time, what a small pocket of Zion would feel like inside a great university.”</p>
<p>He reminded our students at the inauguration that “First and foremost, [a Zion university] will come because they will have the gospel of Jesus Christ planted so deeply in their hearts that their natures will be transformed by the Savior’s atoning sacrifice.&nbsp;I have often said that at this university we are about not just &nbsp;information, but transformation.” He said that, “Consecration and sacrifice will become part of their characters.”</p>
<p>And he also said this, I was interested he said that “All the presidents of BYU-Hawaii have known and felt this same charge.... [and] each has made a personal contribution to the university’s rising to its destiny as a Zion university.” He used that phrase a couple or three times, “a destiny as a Zion university”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid all these remarks, I was really touched and gratified to hear President Eyring say finally, he finally issued the prophetic charge I had tried to coax out of him many months before. Or really rather, he ratified the charge that I felt I had received from Heaven. He said: “President Tanner, you have your charge to help the Lord build a Zion community here.”</p>
<p>So since this is my charge, from the Lord as ratified and confirmed by a Prophet of God. Sister Tanner and I felt that we should speak about becoming a Zion university with you today, even at the risk of repeating some of the things we said a few days ago at the ‘Ohana meeting. Because we want everybody, including you students who are hearing this for the first time, we want you all to reflect on what it means to build a Zion university and how you can contribute to this ideal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it’s clearly a fact that Zion is an ideal. That idea of Zion is an ideal. It will not be fulfilled in its fullness until the Savior comes. For Latter-day Saints, Zion shines brightly on the horizon of our hopes and dreams. Not as a mirage but as a Millennial reality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence in my inauguration both President Eyring and I spoke of this university savoring Zion we spoke of glimpsing Zion here. We know we’ll be imperfect but that we can approach the ideal. Just as Hugh Nibley’s books is entitled “Approaching Zion.” We know the full realization of the dream of Zion awaits the Second Coming. Nevertheless, we fervently embrace and strive to realize the dream of Zion all the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is good for the soul to seek impossible dreams. I stand with Don Quixote who sings of the importance of the quest after impossible dreams in Man of La Mancha. Lofty goals lift our sights and fire our imagination. &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kimball had quoted someone saying: “Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men’s blood.” <a href="#FN4">[4]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis wisely observed, “Aim at Heaven and you will get earth ‘thrown in’: aim at earth and you will get neither.” <a href="#FN5">[5]</a></p>
<p>So we aim at Heaven. We shoot for the stars. Again I would like to quote President Kimball: “Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But like the seafaring man in the deserts of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them you reach your destination.” <a href="#FN6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Zion is such an ideal; it is our guiding star. Zion has served as an inspiring dream and fond ideal for Latter-day Saints from the earliest days of the Restoration. It is the theme of countless hymns by famous nineteenth-century LDS hymnists — such as W. W. Phelps, Parley P. Pratt, Eliza R. Snow, and Charles Penrose. “Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion city of our God!” exults W. W. Phelps in one of several hymns he wrote about Zion. And Latter-day Saint still today fondly sing the refrain, “Zion, Zion, lovely Zion; Beautiful Zion; Zion, city of our God!”</p>
<p>Now as I have thought about this topic and the origins of this place and its unique connection to the land. I have come to feel that our branch of Zion U, being located in Laie, has a Hawaiian flavor. Zion here savors of Hawaii. For me, several important Hawaiian words are redolent with the sweet aroma of Zion. They ought to infuse the flavor of Zion here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Aloha: First and foremost is “aloha.” This is a very rich word, with layers of meaning. It is much more than a touristy way of saying hello and goodbye. It connotes so much more. Above all, aloha connotes love. Aloha connotes charity—the pure love of Christ. This is the deep source of aloha. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We rightly speak also of the spirit of aloha, because aloha incorporates many values into a real but intangible spirit that comes when people live together in harmony and love—just as happens in Zion. &nbsp;There is a spirit of aloha and aloha has to do with the Spirit. People often talk to me about the special spirit that is here at BYU-Hawaii and at the PCC and Laie. We tell tourists that it is the spirit of aloha. But we know that at a deeper level it comes because of covenant keeping Latter-day Saints who have the Holy Spirit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see the idea of aloha overlaps with the idea of Zion. Zion, too, has a special feeling, a tone that may be intangible but is very real. There is and must always be a special spirit here at BYU-Hawaii. May you feel this spirit here; may you taste it, relish it, and may you add to the sweet savor of Zion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And then when you leave this place may you cherish in your heart this experience of savoring Zion and an appetite for Zion wherever you roam. I envision our students taking the sweet savor of Zion, the spirit of aloha, the pure love of Christ—with them around the world. I imagine you building up little outposts of Zion in your homes, congregations, communities, and countries. There will be little branch campuses of BYU-Hawaii, little Laie’s as it were sprinkled across the world. These will bring aloha, light, love, and peace to bless and brighten a dark and tumultuous world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way you will fulfill the famous prophecy of David O. McKay: “You mark my words, and from this school, I’ll tell you, will go men and women whose influence will be felt for good toward the establishment of peace internationally.”</p>
<p>2. Pono: Another important word in the lexicon of Hawaiian Zion is “pono,” meaning roughly righteousness. This word is inscribed in the Hawaiian State Motto:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ua Mau Ke Ea O Ka Aina I Ka Pono&nbsp;</p>
<p>The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.</p>
<p>“Pono” must be inscribed in the hearts of a Zion people: for Zion is the pure in heart. <a href="#FN7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Without people with pono, there can be no Zion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From its founding, David O. McKay insisted that the branch of Zion U to be built here must concern itself with character development. “Character is higher than intellect,” he said. This school’s purpose was to produce men and women of noble character. He called them “genuine gold.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to think about this mission part of our mission as a Zion University is to prepare our students with pono — righteousness, virtue, goodness. How this world need graduates with pono, more than skills and smarts, it needs honor, integrity, virtue, righteousness — pono. You degree, which bears this university’s name, tells the world that you can be counted on to perpetuate the life of the land in righteousness, for you are an alumni of the Hawaiian branch campus of Zion U.</p>
<p>3. ‘Ohana: Another critical concept from our founding and for the idea of Zion is ‘ohana. It means family. I hope that you have heard it many time and have felt it. We have. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This university will savor of Zion to the degree that we cultivate a family feeling, knowing that in the gospel we are all truly, in very fact, brothers and sisters. In eternity, all our titles and positions and honors of men will fade into insignificance. What will be left is our relationship as brothers and sisters. And what our Father in Heaven will care about is if we treated each other as brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>This family relationship is also part of a Zion ideal. In Zion all are treated equally. There are no “ites”. All are equally loved and important. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This gospel doctrine of the Fatherhood of God and its concomitant doctrine of the brotherhood of man, were vital to the vision of first Apostle McKay and then President McKay when he envisioned and established a school in Zion here. This was a place where all nations and races could live in love and harmony as equals united in brotherhood. The vision of this happening at the flag-raising ceremony made Apostle McKay weep.</p>
<p>He wrote in his diary in February 1921:</p>
<p>“As I looked at that motley group of youngsters... my bosom swelled with emotion and tears came to my eyes.... The Church of Christ will truly make of all nations one blood. May God hasten the day when this is accomplished.”</p>
<p>May you feel and may you cultivate the spirit of ‘ohana here. You are surrounded by your brothers and sisters; your aunties and uncles. Learn to love people of all colors and diverse backgrounds here. This savors of Zion.</p>
<p>4. Kuleana: Another important Hawaiian Zion word is “kuleana.” It means “stewardship.” It carries the notion of both rights and responsibilities, as does the LDS concept of stewardship. Remember from the Doctrine and Covenants how important the idea of stewardship is for Zion communities. Everyone was formally assigned a stewardship in the United Order. Each person was to care for and develop their stewardship—including the land or business they were assigned, or their particular talents. They were to be used for the good of the whole community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In ways we don’t have time to develop, something similar happened in Hawaiian history. Families received a kuleana. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You, too, are called to learn your duty for your stewardship and act faithfully in it. If you are a student, you have a kuleana to yourself and the whole class to prepare and share, as our learning model outlines. If you are a faculty, you too have a kuleana, as do staff—whether you take care of grounds or admissions. In a Zion U, we all have our kuleanas. God expects us to &nbsp;magnify these responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Malama ka ‘aina : Another similar Hawaiian Zion phrase is “malama ka ‘aina.” It means respect and love for the land. Zion a sacred place. A beautiful place. The Lord invited his saints to tend and take good care of their Zion homes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At this island branch campus of Zion U, we are to do the same. Again, President McKay emphasized this when he founded the university. He said that our buildings should “radiate light.” He encouraged the community to keep its yards clean and to keep the streets clean. He wanted this community to reflect Zion community in its visible appearance and he wanted us to be good stewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Pu'uhonua: Another very important Zion Hawaiian word is “pu’uhonua.” It means place or hill of refuge. It refers to the ancient Hawaiian practice of designating some sacred places as sanctuaries, where one could find protection and sanctuary from enemies. These pu’uhonuas were also places of forgiveness and spiritual transformation.</p>
<p>Laie was anciently such a place—a place of refuge. This ancient may have led the Saints to seek Laie out as a gathering place. It certainly is consonant with the location of a temple here—the Lord’s sanctuary, house on a hill of peace and spiritual enlightenment and renewal newness of life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Zion University, BYU-Hawaii can become a place of refuge, of gathering out of the world, of renewal, sanctuary, and refuge. A place which prepares you to go back into the world better people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that it will be so for you. That you will be renewed here. That you will be safe among us. It grieves me to hear when anyone is victim of aggression or unkindness. Here all should be safe in Zion. We all have a responsibility to make this an LDS pu’uhonua.</p>
<p>7. Hukilau: Zion is a place where everyone pulls together. All things are held in common. All work for the good of all, in a spirit of consecration. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of “hukilau” captures this aspect of Zion for me. The tradition of hukilau was invented here, right out on hukilau beach. Pulling nets together was a way to feed the community. Like Zion, this is a place where LDS have long pulled together—in the sugar plantation first, and in the hukilau. The community had hukilaus to raise money to rebuild the chapel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we become a Zion community; may we live the principles of Zion here. So that this place, although it won’t be perfect, should savor of Zion. Where we can glimpse these great ideas. Where we can come together in a desire to create something wonderful, something magnificent, something that savors and tastes of Zion.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
