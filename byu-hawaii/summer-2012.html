<p>Aloha and Good Morning!</p>
<p>Sister Michie and I are thrilled to be with you today in Laie. We have a number of good friends present. President Wheelwright and I graduated together from East High School in Salt Lake City in June, 1961. I have read his January 10th devotional address to you on the subject of leadership. I commend his talk to you. President Spencer W. Kimball once said that, "The mission of Ephraim is Leadership."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Similarly, Elder and Sister Steve and Lynne McDonough, who currently serve as the site directors at the Hawaii Temple Visitors Center, have been good friends of ours for many years. They have raised a great family of six children and Lynne is an expert genealogist.</p>
<p>And, Dr. Helena Hannonen, Professor of Business Management on this campus, is a native of Lappeenranta, Finland where we met last summer at a Sacrament Meeting in her mother's home ward.</p>
<p>As you visit the nation's capitol in Washington, DC and tour the great national memorials along the Potomac River, looking across to the other side of the Tidal Basin, one is drawn to a beautiful marble domed monument known as the Jefferson Memorial, honoring the memory of the Third President of the United States and drafter of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson. Chiseled in marble on the inside of the dome encircling the head of the eighteen foot high statue of Jefferson are these words: "I have sworn upon the alter of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>I ask you to keep this powerful statement in mind as we reason together over the next few minutes.</p>
<p>I congratulate each of you on your decision and qualification to attend to your higher education at this special university. Sister Michie and other family members are graduates of BYU. Brigham Young, who is the founder and namesake of BYU, is also the founder of another great university. It is the school from which I graduated, the University of Utah.</p>
<p>On February 28, 1850, the Territorial Board of Regents of the Territory of Utah convened in a special session at the request of Territorial Governor Brigham Young. It was a momentous occasion, the founding of the first university west of the Missouri River, the University of Utah. During that meeting, Governor Young made this important observation concerning education: "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the day's work, and the power to appreciate life."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>This is my all-time favorite quote. Over the past twenty years I have assembled a small collection of quotes from great men which have had significant meaning in my life. When I was Commissioner of Insurance in Utah, I used to sit down with every new employee, give them a copy of my collection, which I entitled, "A Philosophical Basis" and we would have a good conversation about these quotes. It was a teaching moment. And today, I would like to share some of them with you and teach you as I can.</p>
<p>Notice that President Young used the word "power" three times. Education is, therefore, empowering. How? First, the power to think clearly, to be able to understand and to process ideas and communicate them with clarity. A famous quote says that "a man can only think to the limit of his vocabulary." Along with your liberal education comes an expanded vocabulary helping you to process thoughts and ideas with clarity. You become increasingly empowered and enabled to deal with the complexity of our times and get to the bottom of things. You can handle highly complicated concepts and weigh priorities and values. Some call these critical thinking skills. This allows you to more properly make correct decisions and act appropriately to the dictates of your own mind.</p>
<p>Second, the power to act well in the day's work. You may receive training in a specific field of art or science that, along with post academic or on-the-job training, gives you an expertise in a career where you can make a difference and earn a living for your family. Employers are willing to pay for the services of an individual who has acquired real "know how." This empowerment also raises your confidence and you feel prepared to step forward into the real world. This confidence in your abilities tells you that you are "good at something" as well as "good for something" and that you are prepared to take your place in society. And maybe even sufficiently confident to ask that certain someone to marry you, then the two of you walk the earth together as a new family unit prepared to keep God's first commandment that you may have joy in your posterity.</p>
<p>The third empowerment is, in my mind, the greatest of all: the power to appreciate life. Life is all around us, in so many forms. Living on an island in paradise as you do, you are aware of the beauty and wonder of nature, the magnificence of the universe as you observe it in the night's sky, the majesty and bounty of the sea, and the love of God made manifest in all of His glorious creations.</p>
<p>As you know, many English words have numerous meanings. The word appreciate is like that. Most of us think the word appreciate to mean to be grateful for. But there is another meaning of the word and that is to place value on. We demonstrate the measure of our education by the values that motivate us.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest a family home evening exercise that you might do with your spouse and children. It's called "2-4-6-8 What Do I Appreciate." It's a little bit like counting your blessings, only in this instance, you identify your personal values by the things in life you appreciate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many aspects of life: geology, botany, biology, zoology, anatomy, psychology, medicine, pharmacy, sociology, etc. Below is a small list of four different categories of things one can be grateful for, and shows oneself that there is high value placed on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2-4-6-8 What Do I Appreciate</p>
<p>Physical Life<br />1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The earth and its fullness<br />2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The miracle of birth<br />3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The miracle of eyesight<br />4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;Things that taste good<br />5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;Beauty: music, art, poetry<br />6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The heritage of my forefathers<br />7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;My children and grandchildren<br />8.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The miracle of healing<br />9.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;Strength of body and mind<br />10. The tremendous variety of life</p>
<p>Physical life is just one of many major categories of life. Our spiritual life is also real and ought to be valued by the mind and heart of an educated soul.</p>
<p>Spiritual Life<br />1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The gift of eternal life (The greatest gift of all the gifts of God). Eternal life can be defined as to live with God and to live like God lives.<br />2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The Savior: His love, His Gospel, His Atonement<br />3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The companionship of the Holy Ghost<br />4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The Plan of Salvation<br />5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The grace of God<br />6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The restored Church of Jesus Christ<br />7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The restored priesthood of God<br />8.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;God's commandments<br />9.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The ordinances of the temple<br />10.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The truths found in the scriptures<br />11.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The gifts of faith and charity</p>
<p>Social Life<br />1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;Freedom<br />2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;My family and our home life<br />3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;Good friends and neighbors<br />4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;An orderly society<br />5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;Politics (Did I say, politics?) Yes. An educated person shows his appreciation for life by participating in the politics of our society.<br />6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The right to vote<br />7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The opportunity to travel<br />8.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The richness and diversity of languages<br />9.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;The Constitution of the United States<br />10.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> A meaningful career</p>
<p>Animal Life<br />1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The incredible diversity of plant and animal life<br />2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The balance of nature<br />3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> Pets and animals that love us<br />4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The amazing abundance and diversity of insect life<br />5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The miracle of birds in flight<br />6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The abundance of the sea<br />7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The Sun and its support for life<br />8.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The abundance of food<br />9.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The beauty of animal life<br />10.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The miracle of the regeneration of life</p>
<p>I hope your list covers many categories of life, and that each list is long. Spend some quality time throughout your life pondering the question of: what do I appreciate?</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I have become a collector of quotes. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. To me, a great quote is like beautiful picture. In a few words it gives a glimpse into the depth of another man's thoughts and values.</p>
<p>The very first quote I ever acquired was from Cicero. I was in the office of Bishop Vaughn J. Featherstone and this quote was on a handsome brass plaque on his credenza in a very special and conspicuous place. It read: "Philosophy, if rightly defined, is nothing more than the love of wisdom."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>I have pondered the message of this quote for many years. It inevitably leads one to wonder, what is wisdom? Volumes of books have been written on the subject, but in its shortest and most concentrated rendering, wisdom is to know and to do what is right.</p>
<p>Wisdom has two parts to it, to know what's right, as Lincoln said in his famous Second Inaugural Address: "...with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Thus in wisdom, there is much personal revelation from a loving and gracious Father in Heaven. But wisdom is not simply knowing what's right, it is not just knowledge. Knowledge, once gained is actually a passive concept. The real joy of this word is in the doing. Wisdom is both to know and to do what's right. To do what's right requires courage. As Confucius said, "To see what is right and not to do it is a want of courage."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must be actively engaged in a good cause and "do many things of our own free will and bring to pass much righteousness for the power is in us"<sup>7</sup> as an educated, clear thinking being.</p>
<p>So, if I could, I would give you this great gift of a philosophical basis. I would make of you lovers, lovers of wisdom. It's about being true to your own CTR ring. Having the courage to choose the right, as God allows you to see the right.</p>
<p>Let's examine this quote from Roger Ward Babson, the founder of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts: "Experience has taught me that there is one chief reason why some succeed and others fail. The difference is not one of knowing, but of doing. The successful man is not so superior in ability as in action. So far as success can be reduced to a formula, it consists of this...doing what you know you should do."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>I would like to turn to another powerful thought encompassed in this quote from Daniel Webster. His statement launched an idea in my mind that lead to the single most significant professional accomplishment of my career as an investment banker. Daniel Webster made this powerful observation: "Men can do jointly what they cannot do singly; and the union of minds and hands, the concentration of their power, becomes almost omnipotent."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>In this powerful idea, Daniel Webster makes the case that there is great power in unity. Unity is one of the great and central concepts of any Zion society. It is also behind the phrase that our mothers always remind us of: "Many hands make light work."</p>
<p>I hope you write it down and memorize it. Repeat it to yourself often. You can build a successful career around this one big idea. It is a principle with power, the principle of unity, that together as a team, as a firm, as a family, as a society in Christ, we can bring about many good things that we could never do on our own. As Daniel Webster states it, the concentrated and united power of good people working together becomes almost omnipotent.</p>
<p>In Nauvoo in 1843, Joseph Smith told the sisters gathered for the organizational meeting of the Relief Society that, "In unity of spirit there is great power."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned that an educated being shows his appreciation for life by participating in the politics of our society. Unfortunately, some modern politicians have given politics a bad image. Let me try to disabuse you of that negative outlook. If I could, I would suggest that politics is one of the most noble of all of life's opportunities. I even have a definition I would like to try on you of noble politics. Noble politics can best be defined by an understanding of these two quotes melded together. The first is a paraphrase of Aristotle who said, politics is the highest and best of all the sciences because it promotes the best overall good of all the people."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is a quote from Joseph Smith wherein he said, "It is our duty to concentrate all our influence to make popular that which is sound and good, and unpopular that which is unsound."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Thus as an educated person and practicing noble politics we come to see it as our own personal duty to concentrate our influence to make popular that which is sound and good endeavoring to promote the best overall good of all the people.</p>
<p>I often told my children that there are two words in the English language that I love to hate. Let me say it another way, there are two words in the English language for which I have an unwavering enmity. The first is the word demagoguery and the second is to obfuscate. &nbsp;Both represent the actions of evil men that must be considered as tyrannical. Remember the words chiseled in marble in the dome of the Jefferson Memorial: "I have sworn upon the alter of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man." So, what is the tyranny of these two words and why is it so important that we know their meaning?</p>
<p>Demagoguery n. A demagogue is a person who stirs up the people by appealing to their emotions and prejudices. The aim of most demagogues is to get either money or power.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Obfuscate v. 1) To purposely make unclear, 2) To make dark or obscure, 3) To confuse.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you see why they are both so antithetical to the great quote from Brigham Young? President Young wants us to be empowered to be able to think and act independently, in concert with other men of good will, with clarity of thought, and with an appreciation for the gifts freely given to us by God. Evil men want to take from us that empowerment and to gain either our money or our vote that they might have power over us and others.</p>
<p>There are people out there who would like to manipulate your mind. Their tactic is to grab you by the gut and stir you up rather than to engage your mind. The use of demagogic speech is meant to get you to vote for them, or in the case of print or radio or TV media, to separate you from your money. The proliferation of radio and TV talk shows and the deterioration in real ethics based news reporting prey upon the minds of large numbers of the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have your own favorite demagogic entertainer on one or the other side of the political divide. &nbsp;Some of our radio talk show hosts have become well paid demagogic stars.</p>
<p>Likewise, many modern journalists have lost the integrity of their once noble craft. Our thoughts and opinions on the large issues of the day come to us through the filtered lens of issue-oriented journalists who would rather editorialize on the front page and mask their opinions as fact.</p>
<p>Demagoguery is an increasingly toxic trend or form of speech in our society. Unfortunately, it leads to the poisoning of the well of trust, a condition known as cynicism. Taken to an extreme, public cynicism egged on by demagogic speech leads to a society that is not governable.</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon talks a little bit about the demagoguery of its day, only it uses another word to label it. Listen to how Nephi defines priestcraft. In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">2 Nephi 26:29</a>, Nephi says, "He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world but they seek not the welfare of Zion."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>The language is not precisely the same as the dictionary definition of demagoguery, but they are close enough to be first cousins.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 10:5</a>, Nephi uses the word "priestcraft" to describe this great sin. "But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified."<sup>16</sup> And in verse <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.3?lang=eng#2">3</a>, "and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their [own] God."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/12.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">John 12</a> we have the Son of God himself come on Palm Sunday into the great capitol city of Jerusalem, riding on the back of a white colt; his followers placing branches of palm trees before him and shouting "Hosanna" as they go out to meet him.<sup>18</sup> Yet, within the space of six days from the time of this triumphal greeting by the masses of the people who also knew of his recent miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead, the next Friday Jesus is raised up on the cross to be crucified by His own people. How could this happen and in so short a time? The answer is in the manipulation of the body politic and of the Roman authority by priestcraft, or demagoguery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demagoguery (priestcraft) taken to its extreme, leads to mobocracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the case of the assassination of Joseph Smith on June 27, 1844. He was the mayor of the largest city in Illinois, the Commanding General of the Nauvoo Legion and a candidate for President of the United States. He peacefully surrenders himself, like a lamb to the slaughter, to the judicial authorities in Carthage. Because of the emotional and hate filled speech of the demagogues of that day, a mob is stirred up with such passion that they storm the jail in late afternoon and murder a Prophet of God and his brother in cold blood.</p>
<p>One of my major points for you is to demonstrate that while your education is meant to empower you to think clearly and appreciate life, there are dark forces out there who would like to steal from you your ability to see through the complexities of the day by manipulating your mind and your actions with their demagogic and obfuscating speech. I suggest to you that we, especially the educated young minds of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, must guard against cynicism and demagoguery and expose purposeful obfuscation and other priestcrafts as we see them arise in our public discourse.</p>
<p>My sweet daughter-in-law Sherri has on her Facebook page the statement: "I hate politics." I am guessing that many in this audience might say the same thing. My answer to her was that I love politics. It is potentially one of the most noble activities in our society, but it is clear that in the minds of many, it has taken on a tarnished image. The public discourse of our modern politicians has become pretty disgusting. We used to call it the "silly season," but now much of the political speech we hear is not only uncivil, it is downright mean and full of personal attacks. We appear to have moved too far along the spectrum of demagogic speech patterns, and as President Uchtdorf said in April Conference, we need to "stop it."<sup>19</sup> That may be one of the biggest leadership challenges of your generation.</p>
<p>Hence, I propose for your consideration, the establishment of "National Reject A Demagogue Day." A Tuesday in early November would seem to be the appropriate time for that, don't you think? The power is in us as the people of a free nation to change the course of our political discourse, and to reject demagogic and obfuscating speech and those who would abuse us by using it in its worst forms. How do we do that? We must see it for what it is, which is modern day priestcraft, and we must unitedly learn to reject it at the ballot box.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the GE Building in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and chiseled in stone above the archway of the front door we find this interesting statement: "Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times."<sup>20</sup> For me, this statement is easier to understand when examined in the negative: Foolishness and ignorance shall lead to instability in thy times.</p>
<p>Listen to this important observation from George Orwell. "Political disorder&nbsp;is inevitably accompanied by a deterioration in the clear use of language. Language becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish. Slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>As you ponder Orwell's observation just a little, you will begin to understand one of the most subtle ways that Satan practices tyranny over the mind of man. His purposeful obfuscation of the vocabulary we use makes it nearly impossible for us to think clearly about certain fundamental truths of life. All he has to do is tweak the meaning a word just slightly and it no longer carries its clear intent into the mind of the receiver. For example, the all essential words "faith, hope and charity" have all been tweaked just slightly and don't mean the same today in the ordinary usage of most English speakers, as they did when they were first used in their original early gospel setting. A tweaking of the vocabulary of the gospel has made it easier for the modern Christian world to lapse into foolishness and hence, an inability to understand the fundamental truths of the gospel.</p>
<p>Travelling to Washington, DC not too long ago, Sister Michie and I picked up a little Abraham Lincoln quote book in which we discovered this gem. It is one of my favorites. "The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present...As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, so we can save the country."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>I love this quote from Lincoln. As you ponder its meaning and depth, you find that it is alive with meaning for our day just as it was when first given to the Congress in 1862. Let's take a look at the second sentence first. "As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew..." That would make Lincoln the first person to advocate thinking outside the box or at least not being boxed in by things that are neither true nor right.</p>
<p>To completely understand what Lincoln is saying, you must understand what a dogma is. A dogma is something that someone holds out to us as true, and, if this false idea is not challenged with sufficient intellectual vigor, it may over time become settled opinion in the minds of most men, and generally be upheld as truth.</p>
<p>Now, the last sentence is the one that really comes alive for me. "We must disenthrall ourselves, so we can save the country." The word thrall is a Norwegian word meaning slave. Not a physical slave as in the slaves that Lincoln emancipated, but a slave as in being captive to an idea. As used here, it means to be enslaved by a dogma or something that is not true, captivated by false doctrine or a foolish notion. We should remember the scriptural phrase found in the Gospel of <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">John</a>, "And you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>So, we must disenthrall ourselves from false dogmas and the slovenliness of Satan-inspired foolishness, so we can save [ourselves and] the country. And as Jefferson advocated, we must, "swear on the alter of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."</p>
<p>And now, I would like to close with one of the most beautiful and meaningful quotes from the greatest man who ever walked this planet, Jesus Christ. It is a poetic answer to the intent prayer of His prophet Joseph Smith. Found in the Doctrine and Covenants section&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45?lang=eng#44" target="_blank">121:45</a>. "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>I love the beauty and power of this scripture. It is virtual poetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word charity means to love God and to love as God loves. He wants us to be able to love, in a Christ-like way all men and, especially those brothers and sisters who have joined with us as members of the Lord's Church. I would like to suggest that you write in your scriptures and substitute the word "character" for the word "virtue." Virtue literally means strength, strength of character, or Godly character.</p>
<p>As we continue our education beyond this university, let us be lovers of wisdom. Let us cultivate in ourselves those numerous character virtues that can bring us closer to becoming truly Christ-like. I once counted 113 different character virtues that we can ponder and work on. As we develop and grow into men and women of Godly character, then will our confidence grow that we may actually stand uprightly in the presence of the Father. Then will our understanding of the Priesthood and its power for good swell in us as we magnify our calling in the service of God and our fellow men; we will come to intimately know our Father and His Son Jesus Christ for we shall be like them.</p>
<p>This is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">References</span><br />1. Spencer W. Kimball<br />2.

<p>April 24, 2012<br />Steven C. Wheelwright<br />President, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning and Aloha!&nbsp;What a wonderful sight at the start of this new semester at BYU-Hawaii. We welcome all of you this morning and hope that you will join us here at this same time each week throughout the semester. I am grateful to have this opportunity to talk with you about a fundamental element of the mission of this school, an element that has remained unchanged since its founding.</p>
<p>In 1955, at the groundbreaking services for this beautiful campus, the Lord's prophet, President David O. McKay, stated the foundational purposes for which this university was being established:</p>
<p>"First, for things pertaining to God and His Kingdom. . . [and] what that means toward establishing peace in the world. Second, [so all who attend here can] develop character, and [become] noble men and women. . . .The world needs men [and women] who cannot be bought or sold, . . . who will scorn to violate truth, [who represent] genuine gold. That is what this school is going to produce. More than that, they'll be leaders. All the world is hungering for them. . ."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frequently we speak about that prophetic vision in terms of "learning, leading and building." Today I would like to speak about your becoming builders - builders of strong marriages and faithful families; builders of wonderful communities and successful careers; and builders of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>I love the counsel given by Elder Bruce R. McConkie regarding the charge we each have to be builders. Speaking at general conference, he said,</p>
<p>"Every person born into this world builds a house of some sort and puts it on a foundation of his choosing. And every house built in this mortal sphere is subject to the storms and strifes of life. Our mortal probation is one in which the divine purpose calls for rain and winds and floods." &nbsp;</p>
<p>He continued, "We live in the midst of a swirling storm of sin. The rains of evil and the winds of false doctrine and the floods of carnality beat upon every house.</p>
<p>[But] it is within our power to build a house of faith, a house of righteousness, a house of salvation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I would like to discuss three principles that are fundamental to your life of building. These are principles identified in the scriptures and expanded on by our modern day prophets. The first principle is that of building on a firm foundation, the second is that of building for eternity and the third is that of integrating the parts so that what you build will be fitly framed together. As you inevitably take on greater and greater challenges in your efforts to build a successful life filled with the peace and joy the Savior has promised, you will need to deepen and broaden your personal application of these principles.</p>
<p><strong>A-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Building on a Firm Foundation</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>first principle of creating and maintaining a firm foundation</strong>, is one we are all familiar with. In the Sermon on the Mount the Savior taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</p>
<p>"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
<p>"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</p>
<p>"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the simple yet vivid image that this scripture brings to mind as it contrasts building on rock with building on sand.  I'm sure that many of you have had the experience of building something with wet sand on the beach only to have a wave come and surround it and then as the wave recedes, have the object melt away as the sand once again becomes part of the beach.</p>
<p>For physical buildings, two things are required for a firm foundation. One is to build on something solid such as rock, rather than on sand or some other less stable foundation. But there is also a second important aspect and that is making sure that the building is tied to the foundation. Sometimes this can be done with appropriate footings and at other times it may require drilling into the rock so the building's foundation remains firmly anchored to the rock beneath, and becomes immovable.</p>
<p>A wonderful example of a physical building anchored to a firm foundation is that of the Salt Lake Temple.  The groundbreaking for that temple took place in 1853. Using blocks of granite stone cut and hauled from a nearby canyon, work proceeded slowing but steadily on the 32 foot deep foundation until the approach of Johnston's Army in 1857. At that point the Saints buried the foundation of the temple to make the area look like a plowed field.</p>
<p>After peace was restored and work resumed, the dirt was removed. But at that point, cracks were discovered in a few of the foundation stones. The prophet Brigham Young had the entire foundation removed. After much discussion and with the guidance of the Lord as to how the foundation should be designed and built, it was redone based on that new design. When asked about all the additional work required, President Young replied,</p>
<p>"When the Temple is built I want it to stand through the millennium [along with] many other temples that will yet be built." What a wonderful example of building on a firm foundation.</p>
<p>For us personally, the scriptures make it abundantly clear that the only sure foundation - a foundation that cannot fall - is one built on the Savior and His Gospel. Thus whether building a marriage, a family, a community or the Kingdom of God, we must build on that sure foundation. And we develop and strengthen that foundation by applying such daily habits as prayer, scripture study and obedience. These in turn strengthen our faith in the Savior and tie us firmly to His Gospel.</p>
<p>Indeed as we consistently and faithfully apply those small daily habits and combine them with worthy service and obedience to all of God's commandments, we are "laying the foundation of a great work."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share a very specific example to help you understand both the power and importance of building on such a foundation. The example I've chosen represents the most important aspect of building in which my wife, Margaret, and I have personally been involved - the building of our marriage and family.</p>
<p>Even before we were married in the Logan Temple, we had decided that we wanted to build our marriage and family on the Savior and His teachings. We wanted a family built on a foundation of love, respect and service and obedience to all of the Savior's teachings. But like every young couple, we had much to learn about how to put that into practice. We had to adapt and learn how to become "doers" of His teachings, not just "hearers only." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years as our family grew in number and age, and our personal circumstances made it possible to do so, we began planning for an extended family vacation every few years. Let me tell you about one of those memorable vacations. We decided we would go to Europe for three weeks, renting a van and staying in youth hostels, a friend's vacation house, and other inexpensive venues available at that time.</p>
<p>We gave assignments to our five children - ranging in age from 5 to 14 - to prepare reports on each of the places we would visit and to share those during the business portion of family home evening.  We also decided where we would go in each country visited, what we would take with us, and what cities we wanted to stay in each Saturday and Sunday night so we could attend church and keep the Sabbath appropriately.</p>
<p>This past week as I was preparing for this devotional, I asked our youngest son, Spencer, who was only five years old when we took that vacation to Europe, what he remembered of the trip. I was struck by his response. He said,</p>
<p>"I recall so many wonderful memories: &nbsp;the big red van we all piled into, playing games in the airports as we waited for flights, the narrow streets in Spain where we had to pull in the side mirrors of our van to avoid having them hit the walls of houses, trying to keep serious faces for a photo in an old castle in Germany, falling into a cold mountain stream in Switzerland and having you come to the rescue and put an icy cold compress on my cheek, seeing the St. Bernard dogs at the border of Switzerland and Italy, and taking the ferry from Holland to England. But most of all I just remember the wonderful time we had as a family."</p>
<p>Here is a photo of our family and that red van as we prepared to board the ferry in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>It has been over thirty years since we took that trip, but each of our five children remembers the many wonderful experiences as a family. At the time, our children thought they were going on a vacation, but Margaret and I hoped that we were building an eternal family on a foundation of love, respect and service.</p>
<p>That trip was so successful that a few years later we took a fishing trip to Alaska. Here is one of the memorable photos from that trip. As we continued building our family on that sure foundation, their love, respect and service for each other continued to grow.</p>
<p>In 2001, Margaret and I were presiding over the England London Mission and 200 missionaries when my mother passed away after years of illness. Because we could not attend the funeral, our five children represented us. Here is a photo of them on that occasion as they supported each other while we were thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that foundation of love, respect and service that we have sought to build for our family has continued to stand the test of time. Five years ago, our family decided to take another fishing vacation to that same spot in Alaska where we had gone decades earlier. Here is a photo from that vacation.</p>
<p>And so you don't think we only gather for vacations, let me share one more photo when our family came for my inauguration as President of BYU-Hawaii in 2007. As captured in this photo we again had all of our family together. You will recognize the location as the Laie Temple. This is the photo I use as my screensaver on my personal computer. It reminds me daily that temples are an integral part of our family's foundation.</p>
<p>While we continue to renew and strengthen the foundation we started building on over forty years ago, we know now, even more surely that we did then, that the Lord and His gospel are the only sure foundation on which to build a marriage and family. As stated so clearly by the Psalmist:</p>
<p>"Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it;"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our hope is that during your time at BYU-Hawaii you will establish deep footings for both a spiritual and a temporal foundation. Much like our new on-campus building sites which are currently "settling" before we start preparing and pouring the footings and the foundations, we hope that you are becoming settled and anchored securely and soundly in your faith in the Savior and your obedience to His teachings.</p>
<p><strong>B-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Building Now for Eternity</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>second principle of building</strong> that I would like to share was the motto of the former Church College of New Zealand, "<strong>Build now for eternity</strong>." This principle reminds us that if we build for the long term, the eternities, we will build differently than if we build just for the moment. I love how the prophet Joseph Smith responded whenever he was asked by the saints how permanently they should build their homes. He would say, "Build as though you were going to stay forever."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building now for eternity requires that the quality of the materials, ideas and values applied in whatever you build will be worthy of your good name and reputation and the talents with which the Lord has blessed you.  It also means not compromising or cutting corners at any point in the process.</p>
<p>Some years ago I had the opportunity to serve as a scoutmaster. Early on I decided I needed a project that would engage the boys and their dads in building something that they could enjoy and use. We decided to build Kayaks. After ordering the appropriate materials, we started work on 18 kayaks. I quickly discovered that several of the boys needed considerable training if they were to build something that would float, let alone last for a series of river trips.</p>
<p>When the kayaks were completed, we scheduled a trip down a nearby river. We had a few adults in canoes, but each boy had his own Kayak. Once the kayaks were in the water, each boy discovered how well he had followed directions, whether he had used sufficient canvas and glue on the joints, and whether he had sealed it completely in the waterproofing step.</p>
<p>We had done sufficient quality control that all of the kayaks were found to be waterproof and they could handle the modest rapids of the rivers we chose to navigate. The kayak plans we used also recommended attaching sheets of Styrofoam inside the front and rear of each kayak, to help keep it afloat in case it filled with water. But on our first trip down the river, we discovered that one of the boys had decided that step wasn't necessary and had not bothered to put the Styrofoam in place. When his kayak overturned and filled with water it sank. Fortunately, he swam safely to shore as his kayak disappeared beneath the river's surface.</p>
<p>Here's a photo of one of those boys, our son Matt, with his kayak. We had great fun, and learned much about how this important principle applied whether building a kayak, a career, an eternal marriage and family, or helping to build the kingdom in some far corner of the world. Indeed if we commit to and follow this second principle in all we do, then when circumstances, associates, or the honors of men would tempt us to compromise or lower our standards, like the prophet Nehemiah of old, we will respond, "I am doing a great work,. . . I cannot come down." &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>When we follow this principle of "building now for eternity" the Lord can enhance and magnify our efforts far beyond what we might have envisioned for ourselves. I love the way the Christian writer, C.S. Lewis, has described the result when we enlist the Savior's help in building for eternity, rather than simply relying on our own abilities and designs. He said:</p>
<p>"Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right, and stopping the leaks in the roof, and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts . . . and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to?</p>
<p>"The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of- throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace." &nbsp;</p>
<p>When we build now for eternity, and do so on the sure foundation of the Savior and His gospel, the things we build will have the ability to continue on into eternity. As an example of this, let me return to the experience of our own family. One of the things that Margaret and I did not fully comprehend as we sought to build great love, respect and service among our family members, was how those things might manifest themselves when they each had their own families.</p>
<p>Our five children continue to be best friends with each other. The kind of friends you have on speed dial and that you count on for advice and counsel whenever it might be needed. Let me highlight a few of those frequent areas of advice and counsel, as identified by our now adult children. They report:</p>
<p>We rely on Kristy for information, editing or empathy.</p>
<p>We rely on Spencer for computer and electronics advice and solutions.</p>
<p>We rely on Marianne for calendaring family togetherness and providing encouragement and advice whenever needed.</p>
<p>We rely on Mindy for grand family plans and organizing the annual additions to our family book of remembrance</p>
<p>And, we rely on Matt for home repair help and advice.</p>
<p>Shortly after completing his construction management degree, our son Matt produced a refrigerator magnet for each of our family members. Here is a photo of the message on that magnet: "Call Your Friendly Family Handyman, Matt 435 783-5062." We each continue to take advantage of Matt's experience, expertise and willingness to help in this area.</p>
<p>Let me conclude our discussion of this principle of building now for eternity by sharing a summary provided by Elder Joseph P. Wirthlin in a conference talk entitled, "Build it Right":</p>
<p>"If we build our life with and for our Savior, we will build it from the best materials and with the best effort we can give. We won't skimp on study or training or diligence or obedience."&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Building so the Result is Fitly Framed</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>third principle</strong> of building I would like to share is what is referred to in the scriptures as "<strong>fitly framed together</strong>." The Apostle Paul used this phrase when writing to the Ephesians and describing the way in which the Savior had built his church "on a foundation of apostles and prophets" and included other offices and callings that resulted in an organization that was "fitly framed together." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, when constructing a physical building, this is what ensures that all of the elements are consistent and are tied together. This is the characteristic that is needed if physical buildings are to have sufficient structural integrity and resilience to withstand earthquakes, tornedoes, hurricanes, typhoons and other natural disasters. But such a standard for building additionally requires that the craftsmanship and interior finishes are also of the same quality and integrity as the structural work and the foundation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the English words we use to indicate such consistency is "integrity." The Latin root of the word integrity is "integer." Other words that share that same root include "entire" and "integrate." Integrity is, therefore, the quality or condition of being whole, complete, unbroken, and undivided. When we build something to be "fitly framed together," it will have integrity.</p>
<p>When building an aspect of your personal life - whether a marriage, a family, a career, a community, or the kingdom - this principle enables each aspect both individually and collectively to withstand every challenge. By being "fitly framed together," each aspect is tied to that sure foundation which cannot fall whatever storms or circumstances may come. As we hear the Savior's words received through His prophets, heed the promptings of the Holy Ghost, and then choose to bind ourselves to Him and His gospel, we become fitly framed and will merit all that He has promised.</p>
<p>President Hinckley described our efforts at building our own life in this manner, as follows:</p>
<p>"In all this world there is no substitute for personal integrity. It includes honor; it includes performance. It includes keeping one's word. It includes doing what is right regardless of the circumstances."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie echoed the importance of having our behaviors consistent with the Lord's standards and truths in order for our lives to be anchored to the Savior and His teachings. He taught:</p>
<p>"To say 'We believe in being honest' is to testify that because we believe in Christ and His saving truths, we automatically accept honesty as a divine standard to which every true believer must conform. And so it is with all true principles; they inhere in, are part of, and grow out of the saving truths. . . . It is only when [our behaviors] are tied to gospel doctrines that they rest on a sure and enduring foundation and gain full operation in [our lives]."&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we build for eternity on that sure foundation, and do so consistently and faithfully in all aspects of our lives, we develop the integrity and character that results in our progressing "line upon line [and] precept upon precept." And by so doing, we merit the Lord's promised blessing of being given even more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This principle requires that all aspects of our life be consistent in order to be fitly framed together. Some years ago I had a group of graduate students who became intrigued with the observation that some of the senior executives they had come to know were outstanding examples in all aspects of their lives, including marriage, family, career, community and service. They also recognized that such individuals seemed to keep things in balance in spite of their success in the professional world and the demands on their time.</p>
<p>These students came to me and asked if I would supervise a field study project where they would interview a dozen or so individuals on their list, to see if they could identify the sources of that balance, perspective and success. I agreed and off they went to do interviews and gather some data. What they didn't know at the time was that about a third of those on their list were strong members of the LDS Church.</p>
<p>When they reported their findings they had discovered a handful of characteristics that were common across these outstanding individuals. First they found that each individual had built his or her life - in every aspect - on a core set of principles and values that were unchanging.</p>
<p>Second, they found that everything these people did was of excellent quality and with a long term perspective as to its impact and value. Each of these individuals was very aware of the need to avoid short term or temporary solutions, and consistently sought for solutions that would endure the test of time.</p>
<p>Third, they discovered that none of these individuals separated their life into compartments. They each had a calendar that integrated all activities, whether with spouse, children, community, profession or church, into a single plan and schedule. And, while they always had to make choices and tradeoffs given limited time and resources, they did so only after considering all aspects of their lives. Thus they avoided marginalizing any important dimension of their life.</p>
<p>It was fascinating to me that such a group of students - not of our faith - but anxious to learn the requirements for success, not just in their careers, but in all aspects of live, would draw conclusions so consistent with the principles we've been discussing here today. Of course the fact that four of the individuals they studied were faithful Latter-day Saints helped make that happen. But more importantly, they learned that true principles are true, no matter who applies them.</p>
<p>Of course these are things that the Lord and His prophets have known and shared throughout the ages. I love the way that President Faust summarized the value of adopting and living by such truths when he said,</p>
<p>"Honorable men and women will personally commit to certain self-imposed expectations. They need no outside check or control. They are honorable in their inner core. Integrity is the light that shines from a disciplined conscience. It is the strength of duty within us."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet, Brigham Young, was quick to add that not only should we apply such standards and truths when building aspects of our personal and family life, but we should be equally committed to applying those principles when building the Kingdom of God. He taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you give anything for the building up of the Kingdom of God, give the best you have. . . . Let us devote every qualification we are in possession of to the building up of God's kingdom, and you will accomplish the whole of it." &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have great faith in each of you as sons and daughters of God. My hope is that you will go forth committed to build on that sure foundation of Jesus Christ, that you will consistently build for eternity, and that through your thoughts and actions, all aspects of your life will be fitly framed together and tied to that sure foundation.</p>
<p>I know that as you do so, your life will be blessed beyond measure. Let me conclude by echoing the words of Helaman to his sons, Nephi and Lehi:</p>
<p>". . .Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer. . . that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,. . . when all of his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you. . . because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that these are true principles and that they will lead you to peace and joy in this life and eternal life in the world to come, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
