<p>Aloha!</p>
<p>Behind this podium, I’m wearing a Tongan skirt or <em>tupenu </em>and over it the distinctive <em>ta’ovala</em>, a finely woven mat, which Tongans wear as a symbol of respect and modesty. I begin this morning with another Tongan tradition. It’s called <em>Faka Tapu</em>, which literally means “To make sacred.” Faka Tapu is a formal blessing that acknowledges God and those in attendance and recognizes the presiding authority.</p>
<p><em>'Oku ou fakatapu atu ki he Tu`'i &nbsp;o e Langi.</em><br />(I pay tribute to the King of Heaven)</p>
<p><em>Pea tapu mo Palesiteni Wheelwright mo hono hoa.</em><br />(And acknowledge the presence of President Wheelwright and his lovely wife)</p>
<p><em>Tapu mo e kau faiako mo e kau ngaue 'o e ako`anga mahu`inga ko`eni &nbsp;`a e `Eiki.</em><br />(I also pay my respect to members of the faculty and staff of this educational institution belonging to the Lord)</p>
<p><em>Pea tapu mo e fanau ako hono kotoa.</em><br />(I also pay tribute to the entire student body)</p>
<p><em>Pehe foki ki he kau `a`ahi &nbsp;kotoa pe `oku tau lonuku `i he malumalu `o e fale ni, &nbsp;</em><br />(And finally, all visitors who have graced us with their presence at this Devotional,)</p>
<p><em>Kae `ata, ke u fakahoko atu `a e fatongia lea ko`eni.</em><br />(I humbly seek the privilege to fulfill this sacred responsibility of speaking to you.)</p>
<p>The nod to my Tongan heritage in petitioning the Lord to make this meeting sacred can only happen with the Holy Ghost, and I ask you to join my prayers that His presence will make it so.</p>
<p>I appreciate my beautiful wife Keala for her kind introduction. Last month, we celebrated our 30th anniversary. She’s a proud Kahuku Red Raider, and bringing her to her hometown where she can eat a poke bowl at the Superette, a loko moko breakfast at Hukilau Café, and cocoa rice and bread from Jr Ah You’s Tita’s Grill is one of the ways I continue to court her affection and show her how much I love her.</p>
<p>I thank my nieces for their stirring rendition of a favorite Tongan hymn, written and composed by one of their noble ancestors. Should you ever find yourself among Tongans, LDS or not, ask them to sing "Folofola Mai a Sisu," then sit back and brace yourself. Girls, <em>malo aupito</em>.</p>
<p>I work in television, so I’m a visual person, and I thought you might want to see some of my work. Believe it or not, many Philadelphians actually know where Tonga is because I played football for the Eagles and because of the many stories over the years in which we’ve highlighted my homeland. Take a look:</p>
<p>[Sydney Olympics video]</p>
<p>Recently, I was promoted to anchor the news after 20 years in sports. It's a significant promotion because in a newsroom, sportscasters are typically relegated to the kid’s table while the more serious news journalists have a seat at the adult table. Here’s a sample:</p>
<p>[News video]</p>
<p>So, how did a Tongan boy born in Nuku’alofa, who grew up in TVA and attended Laie Elementary, end up anchoring news for NBC in the fourth TV market in the country? It’s as improbable as many of your stories – growing up in remote villages, yet finding your way here and perhaps even learning English as a second language. The fact that you’re here on this sacred campus is evidence that you have God’s favor.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have often felt the Lord's guiding hand on my shoulder as well as the whispers of my noble ancestors nudging me to do things I wouldn't have the confidence to do on my own. I suspect some of you have had similar experiences. I've found it wise to listen closely with my mind and heart and to feel the Lord's hand on my shoulder when faced with important decisions. Allow me to introduce you to a noble ancestor with whom I share much in common and whose voice I've often felt throughout my career.</p>
<p>The first Mormon missionaries who came to Tonga were Elders Brigham Smoot and Alva J. Butler, who arrived in Nuku'alofa on July 15, 1891. There were religious and political reasons beyond their control that resulted in their unsuccessful efforts, but suffice to say, in 1897, the First Presidency recommended missionary work closed in Tonga. A decade passed before the president of the Samoan Mission, Thomas A. Court, sailed to the Vava'u Group on March 19, 1907 to determine if it was suitable for missionaries but also to buy horses for the mission farm.</p>
<p>According to the book <em>Unto the Islands of the Sea - A History of the Latter-day Saints in the Pacific </em>by R. Lanier Britsch, "When President Court returned to Samoa, he reported that the prospects were ‘very bright’ and he intended to send elders there soon. ... President Court told ... missionaries that friends he made in Vava'u had asked the Church to send elders to open a school and preach the gospel. According to Ermel J. Morton's account of the Tongan Mission, the man who asked President Court to send missionaries to Vava'u was Iki Tupou Fulivai, harbor master" (434-435).</p>
<p>Here’s my great-grandfather Iki Tupou Fulivai, harbor master of Neiafu, Vava'u, which was one of the busiest and most beautiful harbors in the Pacific. Until recently, this was the only portrait of him that existed, probably taken in the late 1800s in Sydney, Australia because he was educated there. Iki was well traveled, working on ships that took him to China, Europe, and even to America - rare among Tongan men at that time. He especially loved the Orient, and as a little boy, I remember playing on his estate <em>Esia</em>, which I didn't realize until I was an adult is the Tongan transliteration for "Asia." Tonga was so remote that it was also rare for Tongans to wear Western clothing, but Iki is sporting exactly what was fashionable at the time in London, New York, and Philadelphia right down to the handlebar mustache. As the son of a nobleman, Iki and three of his peers were sent to Australia to study because the Tongan government hadn't yet established public schools. The other three boys grew homesick and returned to Tonga, but Iki stayed and learned to speak English, although he didn't complete his education - he simply dropped out to travel. Because he was fluent in English, the governor of Vava'u later appointed him harbor master, piloting the tow boat that brought large ships into Vava’u’s scenic Port-of-Refuge harbor.</p>
<p>Presumably, that's how Iki met President Court, whom he invited to stay in his home when he learned he was a minister looking to buy horses. The next morning, Iki took the mission president to a neighboring village and introduced him to a family friend who owned horses. President Court selected two plow horses for purchase. Iki later recalled that President Court produced a handkerchief in which he saw gold coins that he offered for the horses. But true to the Tongan custom of the day, the friend refused the money. President Court was so indebted that he asked Iki how his kindness could be repaid. Iki responded by asking President Court if he could send teachers to educate his children. According to family lore, President Court famously replied, "I will send you two teachers."</p>
<p>Two months after President Court returned to Samoa with his horses, he sent Elders William O. Facer and Heber J. McKay to Vava’u on June 13, 1907. They lived with Iki’s family, teaching all of his children to read and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The youngest of Iki’s 14 children is my grandmother Toa'ila, who wouldn’t be born for another 13 years and is alive today at age 94.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I was thumbing through a copy of this BYU Studies booklet a friend had given me. My friend gave me this issue because the family of a former missionary to Tonga in the 1930’s, named Thomas Whitley, published Elder Whitley’s missionary photos. Among them was this picture.</p>
<p>This is the only photograph that exists of my grandparents Iki Tupou Fulivai and his wife Leva’itai, who appears to be wearing a silk dress that Iki probably bought in China. It was both exciting and haunting to look into my great grandparents’ eyes for the first time. You can imagine the stir I created when I had this photo distributed to my father's family. It was if they had been raised from the dead. We still haven't been able to identify the child, but no matter, these are my great grandparents. If this photo was taken in 1937, Iki would’ve been in his 80s because he died in 1951 at the age of 101. And look at what he’s wearing: a graduation robe and motor board. It’s so fitting that Elder Whitley caught this moment on film because it perfectly captures what I grew up hearing about my great-grandfather and his insatiable thirst for learning. The missionaries came to his home because he wanted his children educated. He saw things and met people in his world travels that must’ve compelled him to yearn for his children to be literate. Keep in mind, this wasn't his undergraduate degree or his MBA. This was his graduation from grammar school! He led by example, sitting with his children and grandchildren, in his 80s, in the same classroom as they all learned math and science.</p>
<p>Here is what the caption beneath says: “Missionaries from the LDS Church initially entered Tonga in 1891 but withdrew six years later, when the extensive proselyting had produced only a handful of members, not all of whom remained faithful. When missionaries returned in 1907, Nopele ‘Iki Tupou Fulivai invited some of the first LDS missionaries to teach in Neiafu, where they opened a branch and a school. When the Tongan government instituted education in Vava’u in the 1930s, ‘Iki Tupou Fulivai became one of the first students to graduate. His wife Leva’itai was part Fijian and worked in the Relief Society. Fulivai had contact with many people from different parts of the Pacific because he was the pilot who helped bring large ships into Neiafu harbor with Fredrick Wolfgramm’s boat, Olga.”</p>
<p>As a nobleman, Iki was pressured by the Tongan monarchy, who were mostly members of the Free Wesleyan Church, to remove the missionaries who lived in his home and to cease teaching his family and neighbors the restored gospel. He refused at great personal cost. Until the 1930s, when public schools were established in Tonga, Iki charged the Church $1 per year for the school property on his estate where missionaries taught in order to satisfy a Tongan law, making it affordable for the Church. Generations of Tongans learned to read and write and were baptized because of Iki Tupou Fulivai. Iki Fulivai's great courage and enormous sacrifice, I believe, is partly why Tonga is among the most literate countries in the world and why Tonga, at 57% according to Church census, has the highest LDS membership per capita in the world. That figure may explain why the Church uses an extraordinary amount of its resources in such a small, remote place.</p>
<p>While you're here on this campus, take full advantage of your studies. Don't squander this opportunity! &nbsp;Many of your peers back home wish they were in your shoes.</p>
<p>Now, by the very nature of this campus, many of you are very closely connected to your culture. You should be, but I would caution, be more connected to the gospel culture. That is exactly what the Lord meant when He said, "But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">Matthew 6:33</a>). If I may share a few examples.</p>
<p>Every culture has customs and traditions that are at variance with or even oppose gospel principles. When faced with that dilemma, which do you choose?</p>
<p>Our Polynesian ancestors all used <em>kava </em>for their most important ceremonies. Village leaders and chiefs counseled together over a bowl, or <em>kumete</em>, of kava. Kava was an integral part of the wedding ceremony. In fact, the Tongan word for “covenant” is <em>fua kava</em>, which is literally translated as "the first fruit of the kava." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet today, kava is consumed socially to the point if inebriation in parties that lead to marital discord, loss of academic opportunities, chronic unemployment, and infidelity. All night kava parties, or <em>fai kava</em>, now replace the sanctity and righteous purposes for which our ancestors used the kava root anciently.</p>
<p>Let's try another tradition:</p>
<p>The word "tattoo" comes from Polynesia. Tongans called it<em> ta ta tau</em>. It was practiced anciently in all Polynesian cultures. I don't know if my great-grandfather Iki Fulivai had tats. If he did, it would be understandable - many wonderful converts today join the Church wearing ink. We accept, love, and embrace them just the same. We are all more enlightened by the gospel. Because of that greater light and knowledge, the Lord will hold me more accountable than Iki Fulivai relative to tattoos. Yet sadly, many still choose to be tattooed despite the fact Church leaders have consistently counseled against it.</p>
<p>The same could be said of the long, warrior-like hair dos that many Polynesian men wear. Quite simply, it's unbecoming of someone who holds the holy priesthood. We are counseled to avoid extreme hairstyles, clothing, and behavior. Follow the Brethren. Do your best to look, speak, and act as they do.</p>
<p>We are all blessed and cursed by the many traditions of our culture. Be prayerful and selective of the many traditions from your culture. Choose wisely from the customs and traditions in your culture that will elevate and strengthen you; discard those that diminish your role as a son and daughter of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is culturally and socially unacceptable for Tongan men to walk in downtown Nuku'alofa bare-chested or anywhere in public for that matter. My mother never allowed me to even lounge in our home shirtless, insisting that my temple needed to be covered as someday it would house the holy priesthood of God. Modesty is one of the pillars of Tongan culture that I cherish.</p>
<p>The foolish traditions of their fathers was a recurring theme of the Lamanites in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah devoted their lives to correcting the many erroneous traditions of the Lamanites' culture.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">Alma 17:9</a>)</p>
<p>Paul chastised the Greeks for their cultural traditions that worshipped false gods, which blinded them from the God of Israel. Standing on Mars Hill, which is just below the Parthenon, the great temple built for the goddess Athena, Paul declared, "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God." Then comes Paul's searing rebuke, followed by his courageous testimony to Athenians of their Unknown God: "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/17.22-23?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Acts 17:22-23</a>)</p>
<p>Like the Lamanites and the ancient Greeks, we all have cultural traditions that are not congruent with gospel principles. Always choose gospel culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to end my message with a scolding, so please indulge me with an observation my wife and I made while visiting the PCC with our adult children last week. We have a long history with this place that dates back over 40 years. I've been fascinated in our last few visits to the PCC with how the Tongan village has been transformed into one of the premier and must-see places in the Center. It hasn't always been that way. I remember when a visit to the Tongan village included instruction on weaving mats and making <em>tapa</em>. Culturally, it was mildly interesting but not very entertaining. I can say that because back in the day, my mother was one of the people giving the weaving and tapa instruction. Then, maybe 10 or 12 years ago, someone decided to feature the Tongan drummers, and now, they have stadium seating, and you have to arrive early to get a spot. See, I don't think it's the drumming that draws people. The drums simply provide a means to showcase the drummers’ bigger-than-life personalities and their enormous people skills. They playfully interact with international visitors and perhaps display a little of their showmanship. That, my friends, is placing on exhibit the cultural assets that caused Captain James Cook of the British Navy to call us “The Friendly Islands”! Take it from someone with over 20 years of television experience, it's a brilliant marketing strategy!</p>
<p>Each of you are blessed with special skills, talents, and gifts that are unique to your culture. BYU–Hawaii is unique because it recognizes that, and your education is tailored to take advantage of those unique gifts and talents. Where ever you're from, it's certain your country has been blessed by graduates of this great university. Be prayerful as you consider how and where you will bless others with your talents and gifts.</p>
<p>If I may be so bold to speak to the faculty and administration, the faith of the Polynesian people is legendary and known to prophets of the Restored Gospel now and all the way back to Joseph Smith, who sent the first missionaries in 1844 to Tahiti. Many in our community feel privileged that because of BYU–Hawaii, we are playing a role, even if only a small one, in helping educate our brothers and sisters in Asia and the Pacific Rim. It is not lost on many of our community leaders that the Lord, in His wisdom, appeared to have blessed each group with gifts uniquely suited to bless the other. In other words, we as Polynesians can greatly benefit from our Asian friends' relentless and tireless pursuit of knowledge and good grades. Conversely, who better to help Asians relax and have fun than Polynesians? Like a good marriage, each has what the other seems to lack. In a university setting, we all learn and benefit from one another. I don't just mean educationally - I mean religiously, politically, professionally, and culturally - professors can learn as much from students as students learn from their instructors. Brothers and sisters, if you only came to BYU–Hawaii to teach us and never learn what the Spirit of Aloha means, then you've cheated yourself and your children of an enriching and life-changing experience. Our lives are greatly impacted because of your willingness to teach and engage us.</p>
<p>I love the way my Tongan culture values modesty, humility, and respect, which the ta'ovala worn at my waist represents. That is perfectly aligned with gospel principle, so I embrace it. Tattooing does not, so I avoid it.</p>
<p>I believe doing so honors my righteous and honorable great-grandfather Iki Tupou Fulivai. More importantly, it honors the Lord, and He honors those who honor Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/2.30?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).</p>
<p>I bear testimony of God's love for all His children, in every culture.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>August 19, 2014<br />Joyce Henderson<br />Missionary and Advisor, Career and Alumni Services<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters. Aloha.</p>
<p>It is humbling for me to stand here before you today. We have been missionaries before, but this mission is different. We did not know that Heavenly Father would give us the blessing of serving so many of you. We love you and feel your love every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Henderson has the special assignment to be chaplain on campus. There are about sixty students who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are the best part of our mission. We have made a special invitation to you. I love you and I am honored you are here to support me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I pray that I can show you how making and keeping promises will bring you new freedom and blessings to become more than you dreamed.</p>
<p>I have always loved to teach little children, so I chose to become a teacher. Elder Henderson encouraged me to become a special teacher, and I received a bachelors and a masters degree in Speech and Language Pathology. I learned and practiced how to help a child who cannot make correct sounds or communicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after my graduation, some parents came to me with their four-year old son Robert. No one could understand him. He would open his mouth to talk and only confusing sounds came out. His friends laughed at him. His parents did not know what he wanted. “Mrs. Henderson, can you help our little boy? Will he ever be able to talk and be normal?” I knew that if I showed him correct ways to make sounds, one at a time, and that if he would faithfully and carefully practice what I taught him, he would learn to speak correctly over time.</p>
<p>To start, he could not say the “T” sound, so with a mirror and a drawing on paper, I showed him where to put his tongue, and we did it together. It was very hard for him, and he became tired and frustrated easily. I gave him some practice homework. I took out a piece of paper that said, “I promise that I will practice three times a day for twenty minutes with my parents.” I then asked him to sign it. At first, he did not want to promise. This would mean he could not watch some TV or play computer games. He would lose some freedom. With some encouragement, he signed the promise. Robert visited me week after week. Sometimes, Robert did not do his homework correctly, but I would forgive him if he would try again, and we kept going. I would show the way. He would sign a promise to follow my way, and in many months, a miracle had happened. Robert was healed, and others could understand him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all think of Jesus reaching out with his hand and with great power healing a child that could not walk, but his greatest healing miracles came when he taught people the correct way to become better, then invited them to make a promise or covenant to follow that way. And when they kept the promise, they were healed.</p>
<p>Like Robert, many good things come when we make and keep good promises.</p>
<p>For example, many of you have a license to drive a car in your country. You were given a license because you promised your government that you would keep the rules. By promising and keeping the rules of driving, you now have more freedom and power. You can now go to more places and go faster than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New freedom and blessings come to your life when you make a promise to your employer or boss to keep his rules. You promise to come to work on time and do your job each day, and he promises to pay you. We can have many advantages and blessings in our lives when we make promises to keep rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we make a promise with God, we call this a covenant. With covenants, God promises to give us in turn much more than we can give Him. A covenant with God always brings miracles and huge blessings in our lives over some time. In a way, we can say that a covenant with God is not a fair or equal agreement. We keep the commandments, and then God, because of His great love for us and the amazing gifts of His Son Jesus Christ, gives us much more than we deserve. His blessings may take some time or faith because God is carefully teaching us with His covenants. We do our part first, and then over some time and maybe over some hard times, He will always pour down His part, more than we can imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are taught by the Book of Mormon and our prophets to make this covenant: If we will choose Him to be our God, and not money, not clothes, or music, or cars, and that if we will always remember Him by trying to keep His commandments, then His promises to us are many:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;He will send the Holy Ghost to guide and comfort us and let us feel His love.<br />2.&nbsp;He will give us happiness and peace in our lives.<br />3.&nbsp;He will let us repent of our mistakes and forgive us so we can be clean.<br />4.&nbsp;He will give us great knowledge<br />5.&nbsp;He will help us prosper and do well in life: school, and in our jobs and families.<br />6.&nbsp;He will protect us from evil and Satan who wants to destroy our happiness and families.<br />7.&nbsp;He will provide a way for us to keep His commandments. <br />8.&nbsp;He will give us strength and faith to get through hard times. <br />9.&nbsp;He will use us to bring the blessings of the gospel to the families of the earth.<br />10.&nbsp;He will give us an eternal family.<br />11.&nbsp;He will exalt us or bring us home with our family to live with Him forever.</p>
<p>We make covenants or promises with God, not by signing a piece of paper like I did with little Robert but in special places like the temple and in special ordinances or actions like going into the water and being baptized. These covenants with God are always made with us by someone representing Jesus Christ, a worthy priesthood holder who has been given authority. When we make our covenants with our Heavenly Father in this way, He cannot go back on His promise to us, and He will not fail us. This I know.</p>
<p>I love the song you may have heard entitled “You Raise Me Up.” The words touch me and remind me that by making promises or covenants with my Savior Jesus Christ, He has raised me up all my life and made me more than I can be.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;<br />You raise me up to walk on stormy seas;<br />I am strong when I am on your shoulders;<br />You raise me up to more than I can be. <br /><br />(Music: Rolf Løvland, lyrics: Brendan Graham)</p>
<p>One of the promises I made when I was baptized as a little girl was that I would pay my tithing. Elder Henderson and I have always paid our tithing, and we have always been very blessed for it. We have food and a house. Our children have been able to go to school, and we have been safe. Keeping the covenant of paying tithing has not taken any freedom or anything from us. It has given us much more than we have given. Thousands of years ago the Lord promised this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Bring ye all the tithes … and prove me now herewith … if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Malachi 3:10</a>)</p>
<p>If we keep the rule or covenant of tithing, He promises to pour down blessings… More than you can count. That has always been true for me. I love the covenant of tithing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may say the promise to keep the Sabbath or Sunday and go to Church takes my freedom, but it is not true. That one day a week, going to church has given us so many happy blessings. In church, my children were taught to make good choices. We have learned to serve others in our callings. On Sunday, we have shared beautiful family times at home, but most important, in sacrament meeting is where I sign my paper or promise with God each week, just like little Robert who needed great blessings in his life. It is in sacrament meeting that I covenant again; not on paper, but by taking the bread and water that I will remember God and keep His covenants as I promised when I was baptized. Church meetings are not where we go so we can be endorsed for BYU. It is not where we go so that we can dress up and stay out of trouble. It is where we go to think about our week, think about being a better person, and promise to keep our baptismal covenants. He promises us His Spirit to be with us. No… Sunday is not a loss of freedom. It is a great blessing that raises me up to more than I can be.</p>
<p>Many of you know Xiaoce or Betsy Ye who left BYU–Hawaii to be a missionary on Temple Square. Recently she wrote: “I just love the commandments more and more. I love to share the commandments with visitors. I was converted to this church because of these wonderful commandments. I learned about Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, and the Word of Wisdom. These are my favorite things to share in lessons and tours. Many will see that we are the true messengers of God, and they really can change their lives for better because of this restored Gospel and the ‘hard’ rules it contains.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2006, Elder Henderson and I went to live in Malawi, Africa. The company that Elder Henderson worked for had a desire to help thousands of orphan children who were dying of starvation. It was hard work in that poor country, but Elder Henderson and his colleagues built a food factory, gave jobs to many workers, and were able to feed about 80,000 children every day. It was a great experience to help so many children.</p>
<p>We lived in the capital city of Lilongwe. There were only a few members of the Church and no church meetings. We had a small truck, and Elder Henderson and I started to do missionary work at night. We began to hold Sunday meetings in a room where corn was stored. We found a member of the Church, Brother Ntoloa. He now was married to a lady who was not a member, and they had a little boy. One night, we visited their one-room house in a cornfield to teach Sister Ntoloa the gospel. They had one light in the room, and we could all sit together as we taught this dear lady about the Savior and the Book of Mormon. As we were starting, it began to rain. The little house had an iron roof, so the rain was very, very loud. Then… the electricity went off. Quickly, they brought two small candles for light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What shall we do to teach Sister Ntoloa?” we thought. It felt so empty and cold, and rain was pounding down. Then Elder Henderson turned to 3 Nephi, the story about the Savior coming to the people in America after the resurrection. We took turns reading by the small light. We had to read loudly to hear each other. When we read about Jesus Christ showing his hands and feet, a very strong feeling came into the room. The Holy Ghost came into the dark and cold and touched our hearts that the story was true. We felt warm and close. Sister Ntoloa could feel the Savior’s love for her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Ntoloa followed the feelings of the Holy Ghost and was baptized. She made the covenants of baptism that her husband had made, and together, they started a new life. Brother Ntoloa was a schoolteacher. They were poor but began to pay their tithing. One month, the government did not give the teachers their salary. Three weeks went by with no pay, and one night, the family only had a little corn to eat – not enough for the three of them. Brother Ntoloa told his wife to cook the corn. Then they went down on their knees as a family, and the father prayed. He told Heavenly Father that they had done all they could. They walked five miles to church every Sunday. They had stopped drinking tea and were keeping the Word of Wisdom. He had worked hard, and they had kept the covenants they had made when baptized, including paying their tithing. Now, they did not have enough to eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As they said “amen,” someone knocked at their door. It was a friend who had his arms full of lovely vegetables. He said that he had some very good luck and had extra and asked if they wanted to share his food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were able to have a good meal that night. It was a miracle. The Ntoloas learned that the Lord would keep His promises to them. On Monday, Brother Ntoloa received his pay. His wife started to go to school and also became a schoolteacher. Soon our little church group grew to be a branch, and Brother Ntoloa was called as the branch president or bishop. They had kept their covenants with faith. God had poured out His blessings. They were a happy family in their little house, and now they were leading and showing others how to have the same blessings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Malawi, Africa, everyone had to walk. There were very few cars. One afternoon, the Spirit whispered to Elder Henderson to give a ride to a young man walking along the road. Elder Henderson invited Steven, his wife, and his two small daughters to come to church that Sunday. They came, and we taught them the gospel and the blessings of making covenants or promises by being baptized into the Lord’s true church. They were baptized. However, Steven and his little family soon faced some hard challenges. When the landlord found they were seeing Mormons, they came home one day to find all their furniture on the road, and they were kicked out of their house. Then Steven faced some hard temptations at work and made some mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Elder Henderson and I flew back to the Utah, we were a little discouraged. Many hungry children had been fed from our factory and our little church group was meeting each week, but could it last without us? Maybe we did more bad than we did good. Maybe it would have been better if we had not come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Months later, we heard that the Church was growing. A few years later, we heard that our convert friend Steven had returned to church. He had forgotten some of his baptismal covenants and had made some mistakes, but the Lord had not forgotten His part of the covenants. Even though Steven was lost for a time, the Holy Ghost reached out to him and helped him remember the promises he made. Steven repented. He paid back the people he hurt. He confessed his mistakes to the branch president and became a stronger husband and father. Soon Steven and his family were back in church each Sunday and helping others to learn about the Savior’s plan of happiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we received an email from Steven:</p>
<p>“This morning I went to lead at a new church group, which will soon be organized into a branch. This will be the fifth branch in the capital Lilongwe. As I was sitting there in front and watching these members who have been walking many miles every Sunday to the Lilongwe branch, I was filled with the Spirit, and I was reminded of you. In a few days to come, Lilongwe will be organized into a district (like a small stake). The Church in Lilongwe is growing so fast that we cannot even understand it. I will always remember that Saturday afternoon when you gave me a ride and introduced the Church to me. Steven.”</p>
<p>We learned from this experience that teaching Steven and the Ntoloas is not our work. It is Heavenly Father’s work. We are His servants, and if we are willing, He will use us to bless many, many people. Brother and Sister Ntoloa or Steven could have said, “Oh, Africa is so big, with millions of people, and I am just one person. I cannot make a difference. Elder and Sister Henderson will soon leave, and we will not have those same feelings we had with them, and we will be alone with no help.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ntoloas and Steven had been baptized, made covenants, and had been given the Gift of the Holy Ghost. They were given strength and the blessings of the gospel without us. Now thousands would be raised up and blessed because of a few.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">D&amp;C 64:33</a>)</p>
<p>Even though we may be small and weak, He will make great things from our work. We are making a beginning or foundation for His true Church, which will one day soon fill the earth.</p>
<p>Many of you went home to visit your families during this break. Some of you had not been home for two or three years, and it was very special to be with your parents again. One of you told me with tears in your eyes when you came back to BYU that you could see the sad look on your mother’s face when you said good-bye at the airport. Some of you went home to say a sad good-bye to a grandmother or grandfather who left this world while you were there. Some of you said a happy hello to a new baby born to a cousin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to introduce you to one of our new granddaughters named Sarah, born December 13. Her 15-year old brother Cayden said to us, “I felt the Spirit of Heavenly Father very strong when my mother asked me to take care of my baby sister. I felt warm and happy inside as Sarah smiled and laughed with me!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>These feelings we have for our dear family members are so real and important. I do not believe God sent us to loving families so that we will then never be together again after we die. Because He loves us, He has made a way for us to be with our dear loved ones. I want you to know that I know that God has made a way through making and keeping holy covenants that we can be with our families forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great blessings of my life has come because Elder Henderson and I made promises to each other and to God when we were married in the temple. Satan has no power over us when we keep the strict rules of temple marriage, and God has blessed us with more than we ever dreamed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you will let me be very personal for a minute because my family is my life's dream and my treasure. These are our seven children. Our four sons are all worthy priesthood holders and good fathers. The oldest was born while we were students and came to our home during the second day of final exams during Elder Henderson's junior year. Just after Elder Henderson's graduation, our twin boys were born, on February 14, Valentine’s Day. We had recently moved to our first job. Everything in our small home was borrowed, including the three cribs or baby beds. With three babies under one-year old, and diapers we had to wash, our lives seemed an endless round of feeding, diapers, washing clothes, and crying babies. We learned quickly to work together as a team. Elder Henderson would take his turn and get up with a crying baby late at night so I could rest. I would try to have dinner and look nice for him when he came home from work. We went on our knees a lot and prayed that the Lord would somehow give us the strength and money to keep going. We remembered the sacred covenants that we had made with each other and God in the temple, and He remembered us. We added three more girls and another son. We were happy and felt richly blessed to have such a special family.</p>
<p>All of our children have blessed us beyond measure. They brought precious grandchildren to us with great love and sacrifice. Raising a family is not easy. We have known times of happy family experiences together. But we have also known heartache and pain. At times, Elder Henderson and I have knelt together with heavy hearts and asked for help when we could not see the way. Heavenly Father has always heard our prayers and raised us up to be more than we could be, together, to realize the blessings of our temple covenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been to many of your weddings at the temple. You come from far away countries. You usually have no family at your wedding because some of your parents are not members of the Church, and sometimes they do not agree with your marriage. But a few years before, you were taught about a loving Father in Heaven and his Son Jesus Christ who has prepared a way for you to have an eternal companion and sweetheart forever. You learned about covenants and were asked to keep new rules like having clean thoughts, going to Church, and not drinking. These rules blessed you. Some of you went to serve missions and share this truth and good news with others. But your big dream was to one day find that right guy or girl, a worthy priesthood holder or beautiful princess, and be married in the temple for time and all eternity. And so we have watched you come through the sealing room door dressed in white, like a king and queen, holding hands, frightened but really, really happy. It is so awesome to watch. You kneel at the altar, hold hands, and look into each other’s eyes. Then the brother with authority to seal asks if you are willing to enter into this covenant and promise. We have seen the tears from your eyes come down your cheeks and wet your hands as you quietly say “yes.” Then, with simple but powerful words, he makes you one, husband and wife for time and all eternity. He promises you family and joy if you will keep this special covenant. How blessed Elder Henderson and I have been to be there with you.</p>
<p>Please know how much I love you, those who are members of the Church and those who are not. I love you like my very own. Like Ho Si read, when we go with the Lord, He will renew our strength, and we will go up with wings of eagles. You can be like the rest of the world if you want. You can study, work hard, get married, and do many good things in your life. But there is much, much more for you. Through the Savior and the Gift of the Holy Ghost, you will be blessed to fill the great mission of your lives. I have traveled all over the world. There are millions of hungry children, and you will help feed them for sure. But the real problems in the world are anger, selfishness, no hope, broken homes, and forgotten children. I have seen it. The real solution in the world will come when you and the friends you love accept the teachings of Jesus Christ and make and keep covenants with Him. I will say it again. The real solution will come when you and the friends you love accept the teachings of Jesus Christ and make and keep covenants with Him. This is God’s way. It may seem slow and you may feel weak or distracted by homework, school, tennis, and cars, but it is still true. The boy Joseph Smith really did see God the Father and His Son Jesus. They brought back to the earth again the power to make covenants with Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ really lives and has a plan for you. When you make and keep promises with Him, power will come into your life. Jesus will forgive you of your mistakes and make you more than you can be. He will make you a savior like Him to bless and save your families, your country and the world. He needs you and has called you, and I know you are the ones. He will raise you up to more than you can be.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"You Raise Me Up" &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I am down and, oh, my soul, so weary;<br />When troubles come and my heart burdened be;<br />Then I am still and wait here in the silence,<br />Until you come and sit awhile with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;<br />You raise me up to walk on stormy seas;<br />I am strong when I am on your shoulders;<br />You raise me up to more than I can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Music: Rolf Løvland, lyrics: Brendan Graham)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I invite you to make holy promises with Jesus Christ by being baptized, by taking the sacrament each week, and by going to the temple. I pray that the Holy Ghost will tell you in your heart that I have told you the truth this morning and that you will act on my words, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>August 12, 2014<br />Elder Gary Fuller<br />Missionary and Advisor, Office of Honor<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning, brothers and sisters. Aloha!</p>
<p>I am so grateful to be here this morning with you and to share a few thoughts about experiencing a bit of heaven on earth. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention my love and sweet eternal companion, Sister Fuller. She was the one that peaked my interest in the gospel and joined with me, 46 years ago, on our journey together forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to thank our talented musicians for the beautiful song “Where Is Heaven.” Have you ever wondered what Heaven is like? I’d like everyone to close your eyes for just a few seconds. No, you can’t go to sleep! Now that your eyes are closed, I want you to picture what you imagine heaven to be like. Is it bright? Is it peaceful? Is it full of people you love? Acceptance? Is it happy, reverent, joyful, righteous? A place you wouldn’t want to leave? Now you can open your eyes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>How many of you would love to experience, today, bits of that Heaven you just envisioned in your mind? How would you feel? Can we find a bit of that heaven right here in Laie even with the recent threat of the two hurricanes? Today, I would like to share with you what each of us can do to help create a heavenly environment for ourselves and others while living here together on our BYU–Hawaii campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel so blessed to be born of such goodly parents who raised me and my sisters in a modest home full of so much love. Even though we didn’t have the gospel in our home, we were encouraged to do what is right and always felt safe and loved.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father has a plan for each of us and literally creates circumstances that brings life changing miracles to us. That occurred for me when the Lord introduced my beautiful wife Deon to me in a sacrament meeting that I was attending with my recently baptized sister and her family. Sister Fuller was an angel and the instrument the Lord used to introduce me to the sweetness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Through her display of having high personal standards and her firm and unwavering testimony, the gospel was brought into my life. I started attending church regularly, and we started dating. Things were going well except for one major glitch: she was leaving shortly to attend BYU–Provo, and I was still in California. At that point, I knew she was the choicest young lady I had ever met, so I pondered and prayed, and the Lord answered my prayers. It was time to start preparing to experience a little bit of heaven on earth. After Sister Fuller left to college, I decided to take the missionary lessons and read the Book of Mormon. It wasn’t until I read the Book of Mormon and received a strong confirmation that it was true that I decided to be baptized. Thus, my conversion was confirmed through the Spirit, and the words of Moroni rang true”</p>
<p>“And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true: and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4,5?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Moroni 10:4-5</a>)</p>
<p>After my baptism, I did begin to experience a bit of heaven on earth. Things worked out as the Lord had intended, and Sister Fuller and I were married 46 years ago in the Los Angeles Temple, about a year and half after my baptism. Since that day of kneeling across the altar in the temple, we committed to the Lord that we would always do our best to protect each other and our future children from the evils and dangers of the world and encourage the Spirit of the Lord to always reside in our home.</p>
<p>Even when our home was in Heritage Halls at BYU–Provo as head residents, we still felt that urgency to help the 123 freshman girls we lived with put up a protective shield from the evils of the world so that they could feel the Spirit of the Lord, a little bit of heaven, while living in the dorms. &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the years passed and one by one our six beautiful children were born, Sister Fuller and I knew it was so true when our prophet Harold B. Lee taught, "The most important of the Lord’s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home” (<em>Strengthening the Home</em>, pamphlet, 1973, p. 7). Although we have had peaks and valleys, as we all do - numerous challenges and even temptations in our home - we have always tried to help our children feel loved and safe and have a strong desire to follow our Savior. &nbsp;During some of these times, it took a lot of effort to keep the worldly ways and evil influences out of our home, but we were still able to shut the door in our safe and happy sanctuary and gather together to laugh, to cry, to support, to share, to discuss, to pray, and to feel like we were experiencing a bit of heaven on earth within the walls of our own home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Sister Fuller said, for many years of my professional life, I was a high school principal. At each school that I was in charge of, I had a great desire and felt a tremendous responsibility to create a campus climate where my students were protected from danger and evil and hopefully where they each felt loved and cared for - a place where these young people could feel a glimpse of heavenly goodness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I want to fast forward our life 46 years, just like yours will be someday. This is where Sister Fuller and I find so much of our bit of heaven on earth - with our forever family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question today is “How can we create a bit of heaven on earth wherever we live?” Where are we on our journey to experiencing a bit of heaven on earth? All of us here are at different stages and circumstances in our life. Some of us are new students, some married, some single, some looking to find that special someone, some preparing for missions, some adjusting from just returning from missionary service, and some a little older. No matter where we are today, we are all on our journey to create and find a little bit of heaven on earth while we are preparing to return home to our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>We are all together here at our beautiful BYU–Hawaii, experiencing a world-wide student body. Coming together from over 70 nations in a unique brotherhood and sisterhood, striving to learn, to serve, and to become more Christlike in all that we do. We are obtaining an education that will prepare us for a lifetime of professional service in our chosen careers. But more importantly, we are learning to become Christlike leaders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, preparing us to provide a lifetime of dedicated service to the wonderful people of our native lands.</p>
<p>BYU–Hawaii, in a true sense, is a “lab setting” where day by day, we can practice becoming more Christlike in all that we do while helping others to do the same, which will help all of us learn how to create and live in a bit of heaven. How do we keep ourselves and those around us in a safe gospel-centered environment so that we can experience a bit of heaven while on earth as we are preparing for our future eternal forever families? Heavenly Father has a recipe for us to follow that helps us find much joy and happiness while on our life’s journeys. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have included five important steps in the recipe that will help us create and find bits of heaven while on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Creating A Bit of Heaven” Recipe</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Add a Positive and Can-Do Attitude</strong></p>
<p>First we need to start this heavenly recipe by quickly adding <strong>a positive and a can do attitude</strong>. I learned early on in life that the attitude I choose to wake up with each morning will determine the success of my day. In my principal’s office, framed and placed adjacent to my computer screen, was this quote that I read daily called “Attitude Makes a Difference” by Charles Swindoll, author, educator, and Christian pastor. He said, “Attitude, to me, is more important than the facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company; a church; a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. … The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you… We are in charge of our Attitudes.”</p>
<p>Hopefully, when we wake up each morning, we will choose to count our blessings, look for the good, be happy, smile, and be kind to all we meet.</p>
<p>President Monson stated in his January 2012 First Presidency message, “We can’t direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails. For maximum happiness, peace, and contentment, may we choose a positive attitude” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2012/01/living-the-abundant-life?lang=eng" target="_blank">Living the Abundant Life</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Jan. 2012). Although we can’t control all the things that might happen to us, like the wind and even hurricanes, we can adjust the sails by choosing a positive attitude. Hopefully we choose to be positive and hopeful no matter what comes our way.</p>
<p><strong>2. Blend in Strengthening our Personal Testimonies</strong></p>
<p>Next in our “Creating a Bit of Heaven” recipe, we need to blend in <strong>strengthening our personal testimonies</strong>. After adding our positive attitude, it should be much easier to exercise faith in our Heavenly Father and rid ourselves of fear. President James E. Faust said, “If you take each challenge one step at a time, with faith in every footstep, your strength and understanding will increase. You cannot foresee all of the turns and twists ahead. My counsel to you is to follow the direction of the Savior of the world: ‘Be not afraid, only believe’” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/10/pioneers-of-the-future-be-not-afraid-only-believe?lang=eng" target="_blank">Pioneers of the Future: 'Be Not Afraid, Only Believe</a>,'" General Conference, Oct. 1997).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help us exercise our faith, omit fear, and strengthen our testimonies, we need to combine daily scripture study, personal prayers, attending all of our Sunday church meetings where we actively participate and stay temple worthy with a current recommend that allows us to attend the temple often.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>3. Sprinkle lots of Unconditional Love</strong></p>
<p>The third ingredient in helping us create a bit of heaven is sprinkling lots of our <strong>Savior’s unconditional love</strong>. Have you ever been discouraged or feeling down for a while? In the scriptures, the Savior taught that “he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Matthew 10:39</a>). Next time you are feeling a bit down, put this scripture to the test and go do something special for someone else. You will be surprised how quickly you will forget your troubles and your smile will return and a bit of heaven can be felt, just like President Kimball taught: “When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. … There is less time to be concerned with ourselves" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1981/03/president-kimball-speaks-out-on-service-to-others?lang=eng" target="_blank">President Kimball Speaks Out on Service to Others</a>," <em>New Era</em>, Mar. 1981). When we make others happy, we receive happiness and can experience bits of heaven.</p>
<p>Here at BYU–Hawaii, we can practice helping, sharing, protecting, and loving one another, just like we will do in our own future families. When we are unselfish, quick to forgive ourselves and others, and always ready to share our testimonies and the gospel with those around us, we can open up the doors to a bit of heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Mix in Choosing the Right</strong></p>
<p>Now in our recipe, we need to consistently mix in <strong>choosing the right</strong>. The Spirit of the Lord cannot stay when we participate in things that go against Heavenly Father’s plan. It’s okay to say “NO.” Sometimes, we will have to stand alone. I once heard in a Sunday School lesson that choosing the right is like a danger sign near a whirlpool that says “Stay out.” If you stay out, you are free to walk away and do what you want. If you jump in, the only choice you have is to fight for your life. Let’s do all that we can to walk in the light and choose the right so that we are free to experience a bit of heaven around us.</p>
<p><strong>5. Throw out Temptation and Sin</strong></p>
<p>As we are choosing the right we must throw out <strong>temptation and sin</strong>. We all must practice eliminating the evil that prevents the Spirit and a bit of Heaven from being present. We are going to make mistakes, but thanks to our Savior we can take care of our mistakes through repentance even if we need to go to our loving Priesthood leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides helping ourselves, we also have an obligation to help those around us return to Heavenly Father. If we have the courage to not tolerate evil choices in our dorms, apartments, or other university settings, then we will be able to do the same with our own future families. We need to encourage those around us to choose the right because we love them and because we all need the Spirit of the Lord to reside in our homes wherever we are living. If there are people around you making wrong choices, talk with them, counsel with your bishop, or come to the Office of Honor. We are here to help. In the Office of Honor, we have seen so many students come into our office to rescue their friends from their self-destructing choices. Many times, gratitude and love from those very students who needed the help has been expressed to those true friends who cared enough to rescue them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In President Henry B. Eyring’s April 2014 Conference address, he said, “God makes it attractive for us to choose the right by letting us feel the effects of our choices. If we choose the right, we will find happiness&nbsp;–&nbsp;in time. If we choose evil, there comes sorrow and regret – in time. Those effects are sure” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope?lang=eng" target="_blank">A Priceless Heritage of Hope</a>," General Conference, Apr. 2014). Hopefully we all desire to find happiness – in time&nbsp;–&nbsp;by making righteous choices.</p>
<p>We all are so blessed to be here together at our BYU–Hawaii to participate in the Lord’s plan and practice following His recipe so that we can experience some heaven on earth each day while attending school. This time we are spending together provides us with ample opportunities to grow and strive for perfection. Opportunities afforded us here in beautiful Hawaii helps us learn eternal gospel principles and allows us to develop and practice Christlike living habits that will provide us a solid foundation upon which to build our base for our future families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in Laie, we have a total unique combination of the Lord’s plan. What a blessing and a privilege it is for all of us to be a part of our beautiful BYU–Hawaii ohana where we have the opportunity to practice loving and serving others daily as we will do in our own forever families. Our experiences here provide us with solid academic preparation for our chosen professions. At BYU–Hawaii, we receive invaluable leadership skill training for a lifetime of church and community service as we work with our wonderful faculty members, fellow students and church leaders.</p>
<p>And probably most importantly, our unique and special university allows each of us to shop around and find an eternal companion if we haven’t already been blessed to find him or her. For you brethren and sisters who have not yet found that special someone, let’s not let that “H” in BYU–H stand for “hanging out” any longer. Let’s date, so we can find our sweetheart and start creating our own bit of heaven. Then, the “H” will stand for “Heaven,” like in BYU-“a bit of Heaven.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Located adjacent to our university home is the beautiful Laie Hawaii temple, our House of the Lord. The primary purpose of the temple is “to seal and unite families together forever and do the same work for those who have died.” We also know that the temple is the Lord’s spiritual university where we learn about the plan of happiness and salvation. President Gordon B. Hinckley told us that the temple “becomes a school of instruction in the sweet and sacred things of God” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/03/the-salt-lake-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Salt Lake Temple</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, Mar. 1993). We are blessed by attending the temple as we receive ordinances and make sacred covenants. Eternal marriages and forever families are created in the temple by one who holds the holy priesthood of God and has been given the authority to perform such sacred ordinances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eternal marriage brings forth blessings in this life and in eternity. Our marriage can last forever, and our family relationships can continue throughout eternity. We can receive a special outpouring of the Spirit in our marriage and in our life if we remain worthy to attend the temple. Our Laie temple helps us create and experience a bit of heaven on earth.</p>
<p>The Polynesian Cultural Center gives us the opportunity to implement what we have learned from BYU–Hawaii and the temple and to put it into practice by providing us the opportunity to share a bit of heaven with others. The PCC is the vehicle for us to experience a real-life internship where we can practice what we have learned and know to be true. &nbsp;The Savior told everyone to “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in Heaven” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Matthew 5:16</a>).</p>
<p>At the PCC, whether employees or volunteers, we have the opportunity to implement the Savior’s admonition to let our light so shine as Christ’s disciples by displaying joy and happiness with smiles and friendly hellos and sharing our bit of heaven with people from all over the world.</p>
<p>If we all try our hardest to do our best at following the Savior while experiencing BYU–Hawaii, the Laie temple, and the Polynesian Cultural Center, we will be blessed with a protective “Spirit of Christ” bubble all around us. There is not another place in the world where we have the opportunity to “Proclaim the Gospel” while working at the Polynesian Cultural Center, “Perfect the Saints” while at BYU–Hawaii, and “Redeem the Dead” at our beautiful Laie temple, all within a ten-minute walk in Paradise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a sweet senior sister missionary came into our office with tender tears of gratitude in her eyes and said, “God so loves this place. God so loves this place. If it messes up, it’s our fault. We get to dream at BYU–Hawaii and then go live the dream at the temple and PCC.” Each of us need to do all that we can to protect and preserve this spiritual bubble around us. We should not allow ourselves or those around us to do things that will take away our “bit of Heaven” that should always exist inside our precious “Spirit of Christ” bubble.</p>
<p>Let’s remember that each of us living in this special Spirit at BYU–Hawaii are at different places along our life’s path. Along our journey, life will present us with peaks and valleys and numerous challenges and even temptations. If we all try to have faith and stay positive, love one another, lose ourselves in the service of helping those around us, and dedicate our life to obedience and following in our Savior’s footsteps, we will create an environment that will allow us to experience a bit of heaven on earth together as one big BYU–Hawaii ohana, as well as with our own eternal families. We all need to do all that we can to protect this spiritual bubble around us so that we can feel safe and protected from the evils of the world and always have the Spirit with us and feel Heavenly Father’s love, just like it will be in heaven.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to end with the question I started with: What is heaven? King Benjamin, while addressing his people, helps us to understand the answer to this question when he taught, “And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual: and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:41</a>).</p>
<p>It is my prayer that we all will strive to keep the commandments of God and hold out faithful to the end so that we can experience a bit of heaven while here on earth as we are preparing to be received into heaven to dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. I know God lives and our Savior lives. I know they love all of us infinitely and want us to return and live with them again in never-ending happiness, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Good morning, brothers and sisters, and aloha! I am thankful that my wife Sharon is here with me today, and I appreciate her willingness to introduce me. She has shown incredible restraint to only disclose certain facts about me. I am grateful for her kindness and the many ways she has blessed and continues to bless our family.</p>
<p>I am happy to be here with you. I pray that the Spirit will be with us that as I share some of my thoughts, the Spirit will speak to your hearts.</p>
<p>I would like to speak about the great plan of happiness (also known as the plan of redemption) that our Father in Heaven has provided for us. He has provided a way to return to Him. In Alma chapter 22, Aaron, one of the sons of Mosiah, teaches the father of King Lamoni about the plan of redemption or plan of happiness:</p>
<p>“And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king—how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.</p>
<p>“And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</p>
<p>“And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.12,13,14?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Alma 22: 12-14</a>)</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to choose and to create our plan. We write the script of our life. I pray that as we talk for a few minutes together that you will listen as the Spirit speaks to you about what you can include in your plan now and in the years to come.</p>
<p>In a 1995 fireside address to young adults, President Boyd K. Packer, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve, said this:</p>
<p>“The course of our mortal life, from birth to death, conforms to eternal law and follows a plan described in the revelations as the great plan of happiness. The one idea, the one truth I would inject into your minds, is this: There are three parts to the plan. You are in the second or the middle part, the one in which you will be tested by temptation, by trials, perhaps by tragedy. Understand that and you will be better able to make sense of life and to resist the disease of doubt and despair and depression.</p>
<p>“The plan of redemption, with its three divisions, might be likened to a grand three-act play. Act 1 is entitled ‘Premortal Life.’ The scriptures describe it as our first estate. Act 2, from birth to the time of resurrection, is the ‘Second Estate.’ And act 3 is called ‘Life After Death’ or ‘Eternal Life.’</p>
<p>“In mortality, we are like actors who enter a theater just as the curtain goes up on the second act. We have missed act 1. The production has many plots and subplots that interweave, making it difficult to figure out who relates to whom and what relates to what, who are the heroes and who are the villains. It is further complicated because we are not just spectators; we are members of the cast, on stage, in the middle of it all!” ("The Play and the Plan," address to young adults, 7 May 1995).</p>
<p>Here we find ourselves. In the middle of our play, we are the cast members. What is our script? We have options. We can lead this play where we want it to go. Our Father in Heaven has provided guidelines in the scriptures and prophets and leaders to provide counsel and direction. What are we choosing? What script do we choose? I have been blessed to have the Spirit whisper to me many times, “He, Our Father in Heaven, writes a better Script than we do.”</p>
<p>I recently re-watched the movie<em> Les Miserables </em>with some friends who had not yet had the chance to see it. What a delight to share that powerful movie with them. It is such a tremendous story made possible with a rich and remarkable script. Because writing has never been my forte, it is amazing to me that individuals can collaborate and develop such a deep and meaningful script and, in the case of this movie, even set it to music. The characters portrayed are complex, their motivations clear, and the subjects covered are compelling.</p>
<p>Though not all of us may possess this particular gift of being able to write a complex and successful movie script, each of us do have the responsibility for determining and developing our own life script. We are in charge of our own life, we are responsible for the personal script that we choose to write, but you will find as you go through life you too might benefit from collaborating with others: parents, teachers, spouses, church leaders, etc.</p>
<p>I have observed many ways that our Father in Heaven improves on our scripts. Sometimes He works through us, and sometimes, it seems He works to improve our scripts in spite of us. I would like to address three ways we can maximize the impact that Heavenly Father can have on our scripts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We use our efforts to exercise faith in our Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We follow the counsel of prophets, leaders, parents, etc.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We stay alert to observe and adjust as necessary when Heavenly Father is inviting us to modify our own script.</p>
<p><strong>1. We use our efforts to exercise faith in our Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We had a wonderful experience with our son that taught us the importance of exercising faith in our Heavenly Father’s plan. He was about six or seven years old at the time. We were visiting with family for a few weeks and went for a drive with them to Park City, Utah. It was a beautiful winter day; we were seeing the sites and had stopped at one of the ski resorts. As we were walking, we noticed our son had climbed high on a nearby steep hill. His grandfather looked up the hill and asked, “JD, how did you get so far up that hill?” JD’s response (and he had to shout so we could hear him): “Grandpa, you just gotta believe!” That experience has been a good reminder to our family of the importance of exercising faith as you are lengthening your stride.</p>
<p>In my own experience, I had been active in attending church growing up and had a few experiences where the Spirit had touched my heart, and I was trying to do the right things. I guess you could say I was a work in progress. (I hope I still am a work in progress now.) &nbsp;As a young man, a new freshman at BYU in Provo, serving a mission was not in my plan. At the time, I didn’t know why someone would choose to serve a mission. I didn’t feel like I knew enough about the gospel to teach it to others. During my freshman year at BYU, I attended the two required religion classes for The Book of Mormon. During the classes, I read The Book of Mormon, all the way through, for the first time in my life. As I read, I prayed that I might know if The Book of Mormon was truly the word of God. I received clear answers to my prayers as the Spirit touched my heart and confirmed that The Book of Mormon is true. Knowing it was true stirred other feelings in my heart. I knew I needed to repent of my sins. As I read about Alma’s experience as he repented, it gave me hope that I could have my burdens lifted also.</p>
<p>Alma shares his feelings about the pains caused by our sins and the feelings of joy that come as we repent:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>
<p>“Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</p>
<p>“And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</p>
<p>“And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</p>
<p>“Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.17,18,19,20,21?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Alma 36:17-21</a>)</p>
<p>As I felt that joy that Alma described, I now had a reason to serve a mission. I wanted to help others feel that same joy. After these experiences, my plan changed to include a mission. I am grateful for a kind, loving, patient Heavenly Father. I testify that He will meet us wherever we are. His arms are extended out to us today; He invites us back into His presence. He writes a better script that we do.</p>
<p>We start writing our own scripts very early in life. I have twin grandchildren Abby and Ben who are currently two and a half years old. They are very independent children. They know their own minds and what they want and will often do whatever it takes to get it. Unfortunately, they are often unaware of the possible consequences of their behavior, so their parents exercise faith in the plan of happiness to care for their children and help them learn. They are often exhausted by the end of the day as they help keep the twins safe and the house in repair.</p>
<p><strong>2. We follow the counsel of prophets, leaders, parents, etc.</strong></p>
<p>I remember as a child wanting a certain kind of bicycle. My parents were willing to give me a new bicycle for Christmas. My father took me to the store to look at bicycles. I saw the one I wanted, a silver Stingray. It was the fad at that time. My father asked me to also look at the more traditional models; he thought those might fulfill more needs. They were nice, but… they were not the Stingray. I told my dad I wanted the Stingray. Come Christmas morning, I saw the stingray near the Christmas tree. In less than one year, as the fad changed; I remember wishing I had made another choice. It was clear to me I would have benefited more from following the counsel my father had given me.</p>
<p>Recently, my daughter Kimberly called to ask me about buying a car. The one she has is several decades old, and she wondered if it was time to look for a replacement. She was concerned that her car might not last; it might cost more to repair than buying a newer car. I encouraged her to avoid a car payment, to save her money and then purchase a car with savings. She wrote her script; she decided to not buy a new car but to continue a savings plan to replace the vehicle in the future. Some months later, the car is running as good as ever, and she is focused on a savings plan for the future. She is a good example of how we harvest the blessings we choose. It doesn’t always work out just as we would like, but as we follow God’s plan and apply sound counsel, we make room in our lives for Heavenly Father’s blessings to shower down upon us. At times, the blessings will pour out until there shall not be room enough to receive them.</p>
<p><strong>3. We stay alert to observe and adjust as necessary when Heavenly Father is inviting us to modify our own script.</strong></p>
<p>When writing our own scripts, we often include those things that are honorable, even righteous desires. They might include things such as education at a certain graduate school, a specific job, marriage before graduation, or any number of good things. It may seem incomprehensible that a loving Father in Heaven would deny any of those things to you, especially when you are working so hard to be obedient to all His laws and commandments.</p>
<p>You may suffer monumental disappointment when your planned script seems to veer off course and prayers appear to go unanswered. As life progresses, you may find that those seemingly denied blessings actually resulted in greater blessings than you had previously imagined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember these lyrics from Garth Brooks song “Unanswered Prayers” as you work on your life script:</p>
<p>“I thank God for unanswered prayers.<br />Remember when you’re talking to the man upstairs<br />That just because he doesn’t answer doesn’t mean he don’t care.<br />Some of God’s greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.”</p>
<p>Along the same lines, remember that an answer of “not now” does not necessarily mean “never.”</p>
<p>After graduating from BYU in accounting, I applied to work for the Church. I didn’t get selected and began working for another firm in Utah. After a few months working for this new firm, they began laying off workers as the economy had softened a bit. My wife and I were thinking about purchasing a home, so before we took that step, I talked to my boss. I asked if he thought we should be prudent and wait a while to purchase a home since the company had been laying off workers. He said I didn’t need to worry since they weren’t expecting to have any more layoffs. We proceeded and purchased the home. The week the first payment was due, my boss called me into his office and indicated that he was sorry, but they had to lay me off of work. It was a Monday morning; I called my wife Sharon and told her I had good news and bad news. The good news, I would be home early. The bad news, I just lost my job. That same day, Sharon and I updated my resume and printed up some copies (no email at that time) and started to drop some off at nearby businesses. We were out most of the day, and when we got back to our home that evening, Sharon’s mother called. We had discussed that we wouldn’t tell her parents of our circumstance until we had a new job. Her mom had an ulcer at the time, and we didn’t want them to worry. Her mom asked where we had been that day; she had tried calling several times throughout the day and hadn’t been able to reach us (no cell phones at that time). Sharon replied, “Uh, uh, oh just out and about.” Her mom said that the Church had called to see if we were still interested in that job we had applied for earlier that year. Sharon, in tears, asked her mom, “Mom, do you know?” Her mom’s response: “Know what?” Sharon told her I had lost my job. Her mom’s classic response: “Oh, I guess you will want this phone number.” What a blessing! What makes this blessing even more of a tender mercy is this: &nbsp;I liked the job I had, and I think I was so full of pride that had the call come while I still had the job, I might not have been willing to change our script. What an incredible blessing it was for us to work for the Church for over 30 years in four countries. He writes a better script than we do.</p>
<p>My wife and I had the opportunity to serve as religious volunteers at the Utah State Prison. We, along with other LDS volunteers, would meet with the men housed in a small portion of the prison each Sunday for worship services and for a Sunday school class. We would also attend weeknight classes about Gospel related topics. We met many men who had made very serious mistakes and were trying to put their lives back together. They were staying alert to messages that Heavenly Father was sending them and trying to adjust their life scripts. There seemed to be two overriding messages that came to me in our time there:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first message was to our friends in the prison: “You are not alone.” In our Sunday worship services, this message was whispered by the Spirit over and over. As these men continued in their efforts to attend their church meetings, there was a distinct difference that I felt, especially in these worship meetings. The witness of the Holy Ghost was as strong in these meetings, within the walls of a state prison, as in any similar worship meetings I have attended anywhere in the world. Our Savior will reach out to us wherever we are, whatever our circumstance, as we are seeking Him with real intent. The atonement of Jesus Christ is available to each of us to soothe our wounds. You and I are not lost. We are not alone; He reaches out to us still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second message we learned within the walls of the prison was to us as volunteers: “We are more alike than we are different.” Although these men were in prison, they essentially had the same opportunities we all have, to follow our Savior’s example of service to others. We all make mistakes. By ourselves, we are all lost. The answer for all of us, whether within the walls of a prison or free to roam as we wish, is the atonement of Jesus Christ. Our Savior Jesus Christ has paved the road for us to enter back into the presence of our Father in Heaven. We met men, who through consistent efforts, were able to harvest the blessings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to reap the blessings our Savior has sown in our behalf. I invite each of us to take His outstretched hand and return to the wonder of our Savior’s arms.</p>
<p>Some years ago in a General Conference address, President Boyd K. Packer talked about the “Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness.” About the same time that Brigham Young led the first company of pioneers out of Winter Quarters, the Donner party came out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains into the Sacramento Valley. The Donner party had spent a ferocious winter trapped in snowdrifts below the summit. It was a miracle that any survived. President Packer shared the comments of fifteen-year old John Breen who walked into Johnson’s Ranch on the night of April 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years later John wrote, “It was long after dark when we got to Johnson’s Ranch, so the first time I saw it was early in the morning. The weather was fine, the ground was covered with green grass, the birds were singing from the tops of the trees, and the journey was over. I could scarcely believe that I was alive.</p>
<p>“The scene that I saw that morning seems to be photographed on my mind. Most of the incidents are gone from memory, but I can always see the camp near Johnson’s Ranch.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Packer then commented, “At first I was very puzzled by his statement that ‘most of the incidents are gone from memory.’ How could long months of incredible suffering and sorrow ever be gone from his mind? How could that brutal dark winter be replaced with one brilliant morning?</p>
<p>“On further reflection, I decided it was not puzzling at all. I have seen something similar happen to people I have known. I have seen some who have spent a long winter of guilt and spiritual starvation emerge into the morning of forgiveness.”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, sometimes we may lose perspective on the purpose of life. Why we are here and how we can return to our Father in heaven. President Packer continues with these words which remind us of that brilliant morning of forgiveness: “The gospel teaches us that relief from torment and guilt can be earned through repentance. Save for those few who defect to perdition after having known a fullness, there is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no offense exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness.</p>
<p>“‘Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.’ That is, Isaiah continued, ‘if ye be willing and obedient.’”&nbsp;(Isaiah 1:18-19)&nbsp;("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/10/the-brilliant-morning-of-forgiveness?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Brillian Morning of Forgiveness</a>," General Conference, Oct. 1995)</p>
<p>Ours is the opportunity to apply the healing touch of the Atonement to our individual experience. Our Savior, Our Friend, Our Brother has paved the way for each of us if we will but follow Him. He writes a better script that we do.</p>
<p>Brethren and sisters, we write our own scripts. We create our own path. Our Heavenly Father helps us along the way. I testify that He writes a better script that we do. May we be blessed as we create our scripts to feel His guiding hands and let ourselves be guided to include His plan within our scripts so that our scripts become His scripts. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140729<br><title>Sing Redeeming Love | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>July 29, 2014<br />Ellen Bunker<br />ELT Department Chair<br />Associate Professor<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, good morning and aloha.</p>
<p>When I was asked to speak at Devotional, my first thought was “I wish my family were here,” so I have asked some of my family to help me today. You have already met this morning my nieces Jamie Bunker and Miranda Graham. A few more will help me later. I also thank these fine musicians for the musical numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a question for you today, first asked by Alma in <em>The Book of Mormon</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you sing redeeming love?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That brings up another question. What does it take to always be able to sing redeeming love?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t take a trained voice like Jamie has. What it takes is an understanding of key doctrines.</p>
<p>Two years ago, during summer break, Miranda, another friend, and I left for Maui to enjoy a short holiday. Early the next morning, my cell phone rang, bringing the news that my brother, and Jamie’s father, Jim Bunker, had collapsed and died on his regular morning walk. He was only 59 years old.</p>
<p>A few hours later, we attended church at a ward on Maui. It happened that the Gospel Doctrine class was studying Alma 5 that day. As we discussed that chapter, we read from verses 26-27: "And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now? Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26,27?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Alma 5:26-27</a>)</p>
<p>Jim had suddenly been called home—that very day! A few hours before we were reading those words!&nbsp;</p>
<p>His sudden death made it difficult to sit through the gospel doctrine lesson, but the Lord’s timing of that lesson has lived on in my life and has been a blessing to our family.</p>
<p>Jim’s wife asked that I speak at the funeral, and I prepared some remarks before I left Maui, but on the morning of the funeral, as I reflected again on the scriptures we had discussed from Alma 5 in Sunday School class, I felt prompted to change my talk to these scriptures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim and his family, as you can tell by listening to Jamie sing, love music and love to sing. I wondered, was Jim singing redeeming love the morning that he died? He had read the scriptures with his family who were at home at the time, had family prayer, and then they had eaten breakfast with them, all before setting out on what became his last walk in mortality. I would suppose that he was at least singing in his heart as he walked if he wasn’t humming a hymn—as was quite usual with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only did Jim sing often, but he loved the gospel and was a humble man. One nephew described him as someone who liked everyone he met and was “at home” with them; Jim treated everyone with respect and interest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that Alma says in verse 28, “Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.28?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Alma 5:28</a>).</p>
<p>For Jim that day, the kingdom of heaven was at hand.</p>
<p>I could give other examples of how the verses in Alma 5 applied to Jim, but this talk is not really about him but about you and me today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone here, or so it seems the Spirit has said, is suffering—from a death in your family, from illness, from difficulties of some kind. Some one or more of you here needs to know that you, too, can sing redeeming love, right here, right now, even when things seem so difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s look at some other verses in Alma 5 which speak of truths of great importance to us in difficult times: "Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Alma 5:7</a>)</p>
<p>Early in chapter 5, Alma reminds the people how his father, Alma, rescued them from the wickedness of King Noah. He taught them of Christ; Christ changed their hearts, awakened them out of a deep sleep, and illuminated their souls by the light of the everlasting word—as you can see in the verse on the screen.</p>
<p>Once this happened, the people’s “souls did expand and they did sing redeeming love.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And again, I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">Alma 5:9</a>)</p>
<p>In these two verses, what helped them at the first? Verse 7 says their hearts were changed and their souls “awoke unto God.”</p>
<p>Earlier Jamie sang “O, My Father” for us. This arrangement of the hymn has a story.</p>
<p>The day after her father’s funeral, with the family all still in town, the bishop of their ward asked the Bunker family to do the sacrament meeting program. Jamie, along with three cousins, performed this hymn, a hymn which teaches so clearly great and important principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lyrics were written by Eliza R. Snow in 1845, one year after Joseph and Hyrum Smith were killed. Sister Snow’s message, in part, says,</p>
<p><em>I had learned to call thee Father,<br />Thru thy Spirit from on high,<br />But, until the key of knowledge<br />Was restored, I knew not why.</em></p>
<p>In an article in the <em>New Era</em>, Brother David A. Edwards, writes about these lyrics:</p>
<p>"The 'key of knowledge' [Sister Snow] wrote about is the fulness of the gospel, and the song particularly refers to Joseph Smith’s teaching about our relationship to God—that He is literally the Father of our spirits and that we are literally His children.</p>
<p>"Joseph Smith taught that God 'looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard' and that 'if men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves' (<em>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith </em>[2007], 39, 40).</p>
<p>"This particular 'key of knowledge' unlocks the door to understanding. ... When we address God as 'Father,' it is not just a metaphor for a bodiless force that created us but is utterly different from us. It is a real relationship—one that we can understand and that predates our mortal birth." ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2012/11/joseph-smiths-key-of-knowledge" target="_blank">Joseph Smith's Key of Knowledge</a>,"&nbsp;<em>New Era</em>, November 2012.)</p>
<p>The first and most important thing, then, that we need to understand to sing redeeming love in the midst of difficult times is to “awake to God”—to know who God is and how we are related to him. We need to know that we really are His children and that all things that are difficult now will someday make sense in His mercy and grace.</p>
<p>A second” key of knowledge” is to learn how it is that we are separated from our Father and how we can return to Him. If He truly is our Father, then we are surely meant to return home to Him. How is it, then, that we can come through the difficult experiences we have on this earth—described by Alma as &nbsp;the “midst of darkness” — that we would be “encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell,” — and we would have an “everlasting destruction awaiting us,” and yet still return home? How can we sing in such dark times or places?</p>
<p>Let me share another experience where the healing balm of music brought comfort at a time of death and taught THE central doctrine of Heavenly Father’s plan.</p>
<p>While doing some graduate study in London, England, I was introduced to the recordings of a Welsh boy soprano. I brought home some cassette tapes (this was long before we had digital music files) and shared them with anyone that would listen. At that time, I was living with the Dixons, the parents of a friend I had served with in the mission field and worked with in Africa, while I completed my master’s degree in Provo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the fourth of July, again, early in the morning, I received a call that my father had died. He had been ill, and unlike my brother Jim, his death was more expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That evening to celebrate the Independence Day holiday, the Dixons invited family and friends over, and since one of them was a music teacher, Sister Dixon played the recordings I had brought from London. One piece we all loved the most, and I have invited a nephew, Jared Wells, studying now in Provo, to sing a portion of it for you through a recording. He is accompanied by his mother.</p>
<p>He will sing “I Know My Redeemer Liveth” from Handel’s <em>Messiah</em>. The words come from Job 19:25-26 and 1 Corinthians 15.</p>
<p>"For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; And though after my skins worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/19.25-26?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">Job 19: 25-26</a>)</p>
<p>"For now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>)</p>
<p>[Interlude: "I Know My Redeemer Liveth"]</p>
<p>Imagine how I felt trying to sit with visitors I didn’t know very well and listen to that music when my father had just died. I couldn’t do it. I had to leave the room, but neither could I go far away. The music and the message pulled me strongly to them. Job’s testimony and the music Handel wrote to beautify that testimony kept me just out of sight on the stairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the verses previous to those used by Handel in his music, Job says, "Oh, that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in rock for ever!" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/19.23-24?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Job 19:23-24</a>)</p>
<p>Well, these words are in a book, and they are engraved on my heart and soul forever. That day, as I sat on the stairs just out of sight, crying about the death of my father and listening to this magnificent music, a testimony came into my heart of the actuality of the resurrection and of our redemption from death and hell by the power and Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. Although my father had just died, he would again, in his body, see God, and I would see my father again, also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That testimony, that light of true doctrine and the comfort from that experience with a song of redeeming love, has not left me in 27 years! Instead of being a sad memory, it is a memory filled with light and warmth and love and truth.</p>
<p>This is the second key to being able to sing redeeming love—we must all come to an understanding of the central role of Jesus Christ in carrying out Heavenly Father plan for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to know, returning to the verses in Alma 5, that our “garments can be cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Alma 5:27</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we know, along with Alma, that Jesus Christ, is the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth. &nbsp;Alma said, “I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth. And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Alma 5:48</a>).</p>
<p>Do you have this same “revelation of the truth” that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has “come to redeem his people from theirs sins” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Alma 6:8</a>) that Alma had? You need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although my father died years ago, the light and testimony that came that day as I listened to the song of redeeming love composed by George Frideric Handel has not dimmed. I have never doubted the reality of the Savior’s resurrection or our own since that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If life is not difficult now, if you don’t have a current serious problem or crisis, you will have one soon. For example, Jared, who sang “I Know That My Redeemer Liveth” for us, faced the death of his father not long before his Uncle Jim’s death. Jared and his two brothers sang “How Can I Keep from Singing” at their father’s funeral, the song that was sung as prelude at the beginning of Devotional. It proclaims that even in difficult storms, if we are standing on the rock of our Christ, we cannot stop singing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe in two or more witnesses, so let’s add Alma’s witness of the resurrection to that of Job: “The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame. And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets—And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.23-25?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Alma 40:23-25</a>).</p>
<p>Once we know who God is and how we are related to Him, and once we begin to understand the role of the Savior Jesus Christ as our Redeemer, then we need to know He has a plan for us—a path to follow and a destination to seek.</p>
<p>Our birth into this mortal life is a type of gate—death is also a gate to the next life. Between those two gates, we have a path to walk. To walk successfully on the path, we have keep our testimony active and press on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week in Devotional, President Hafoka quoted from Nephi: “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:20</a>).</p>
<p>That is good counsel for this life, for right now. I would stress, though, that we need to keep a focus on the goal past the gate of death, that goal of eternal life mentioned in that scripture by Nephi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where are we going after we die? Do you have the image of that place in your mind and heart?</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Fielding Smith said, “Who, among Latter-day Saints, is seeking a place in the telestial kingdom? Who, among the Latter-day Saints, is seeking a place in the terrestrial kingdom? With those kingdoms we should want nothing to do; it is not the intention of the man who is baptized into the Church, or ought not to be, to so live that he will not find a place in the celestial kingdom of God; for baptism, itself, is the way into that kingdom. Baptism is of a two-fold nature; primarily for the remission of sins, and then, entrance into the kingdom of God, not the telestial kingdom, not into the terrestrial kingdom, but entrance into the celestial kingdom, where God dwells. That is what baptism is for; that is what the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, is for—to prepare us that we may, through obedience, continue on and on, keeping the commandments of the Lord, until we shall receive the fulness in the celestial kingdom.”</p>
<p>To make it to our goal in the celestial kingdom, we need to overcome the trials and difficulties of life, gain an abiding testimony of God, our Heavenly Father, and our Redeemer and Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we are doing that, can we see in our minds where we will be? Can we keep this vision alive in our hearts and minds?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle John says, in the book of Revelation, “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven, from my God; and I will write upon him my new name. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/3.12-13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Revelation 3:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>One last story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miranda’s mother died several years ago from cancer. At her funeral, she requested the song “The Holy City”—that celebration of the goal given to us by John the Revelator in the New Testament. I’ve invited Jamie to sing that song as our “closing song” of redeeming love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Interlude: “The Holy City”]</p>
<p>I thank Jamie for this last Bunker family funeral song, a song of redeeming love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I remind us all that we need to overcome the trials of this life—notice the scripture in Revelation says the blessings will come to those “that overcome.” We need to keep our faith strong in the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. We need to make sure that our feet stay on the path that leads to our place in the “city of my God, which is the new Jerusalem.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm to my dear nieces and nephews that their parents who have died are still live, to confirm to you that you should keep your eye on the eternal goals that are taught in the gospel of Jesus Christ, I testify that Jesus was the first fruits of them that slept, that death has no victory, that we shall all, in our flesh, see God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we all, as Alma invited, be spiritually born of God, receive his image in our countenances, experience a mighty change of heart, and sing the song of redeeming love.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140722<br><title>Things I Want You to Remember | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>July 22, 2014<br />Finau Hafoka<br />President, Laie Hawaii North Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, aloha! My wife and I are honored to be here with you, especially to share our love and testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. President Wheelwright, thank you for the invitation. This assignment gives me a great and happy memory of this very special place, and I’m forever grateful for BYU–Hawaii, for this is where I developed my faith and testimony of our Savior Jesus Christ. Also, this is where I met and married my eternal companion and raised our oldest son in TVA. Yes, TVA is a good place to start.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I spoke here and counseled students to remember. Today, I want to remind everyone of the same principles because (1) we need to be reminded sometimes, and (2) most of you were not here, and (3) if you were in attendance, you probably have forgotten what I said anyway. My topic today is not new but a reminder of what we learned and should remember.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I had prayed for specific help, but the answer didn’t come, so one day, I decided to go to the temple and seek the Lord’s help. I cried my heart out to our Heavenly Father for help. I remembered complaining as I asked, “Why hast thou turned away from me when I need Thy help? After all, I’m a Bishop, I paid a full tithing, I’m worthy, and I’m here at Thy holy temple, and Thou has promised that if we ask, it shall be given.”</p>
<p>Then I received my answer. It was more than an answer; it was a spiritual experience. To my mind came the still and small voice that seemed to say, “What are you talking about? When have I forsaken you? Was I not there when you received your testimony? Was I not there when you made the best decision in your life to marry your wife? What about when your son was critically ill? What about when your daughter had her surgery? <em>I was there and I carried you.</em>” Then I remembered the many, many times in my life when I had received the Lord’s help and felt of His great love for me. I felt so bad, so I asked for forgiveness. Then I realized that it was I who had not always remembered the Lord. It was me. I was the problem. I do not always remember my Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a student came to see me regarding substance abuse, and as we met and talked about his choices, I saw something tattooed on his arm that read “CTR.” I then asked him to tell me about it. His only response was “I’m sorry. I forgot.”</p>
<p>What do you think is the most important word in the dictionary? President Spencer W. Kimball answered when he said “that perhaps the most important word is remember and that our greatest need is to remember” (Elizabeth Ricks, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2007/06/remember?lang=eng" target="_blank">Remember</a>," <em>Liahona</em>, June 2007). Sometimes, we become so busy with our daily activities that we don’t always remember the Lord, so how can we “always remember Him”? We can think of Him often and of what He would have us do. We can pray, read the scriptures, and keep the commandments. We can remember our blessings and thank our Father in Heaven for His goodness to us.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the problems we face today and the reason we make bad choices is because we forget who we are. We are sons and daughters of our loving Heavenly Father. We accepted His plan for our happiness and eternal progression or else we would not have been given the privilege of coming to earth in the first place.</p>
<p>The problem is that too often we forget who we really are and make bad choices because we just don’t remember.</p>
<p>There are dozens of references where prophets counsel the people to “remember” or “bring to their remembrance” the covenants they had made. Alma encouraged his son, “<em>Remember</em>, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.35?lang=eng#34" target="_blank">Alma 37:35</a>, emphasis added). Helaman reminded us &nbsp;“<em>Remember, remember</em> that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Helaman 5:12</a>, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Helaman knew how important it is to remember. He urged his sons Nephi and Lehi to remember to keep the commandments of God. He asked them to remember the great men they were named after. He asked them to remember the words of the prophets. Most of all, he asked them to remember that Jesus Christ would come to redeem the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi and Lehi did remember the teachings of their father. They were valiant men who kept the commandments of God all their lives. We come to sacrament meeting every Sunday to take the sacrament. It is a time to <em>remember </em>our baptismal covenants. When someone blesses the sacrament, we hear him say, “<em>Always remember </em>him and keep his commandments.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often think of the reasons why some members become inactive. I have come to the conclusion that one reason is that people “forget.” I don’t mean forget in the sense that something slips our mind but in the sense that somehow we lose the intensity of our contact with the Spirit. If we could only maintain that intensity, perhaps we would always choose the right.</p>
<p>Let us all remember our covenants. Let us recall our spiritual experiences. Let us remember and share with others the testimony we have received through the Holy Ghost. Brothers and Sisters, “remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the son of God, that ye must build your foundation” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Helaman 5:12</a>).</p>
<p>When temptations came, I remembered to get on my knees and pray. When I was discouraged and felt alone, I remembered that families can be forever. And no matter what crisis came, I remembered. I knew my Father in Heaven was near, and I knew He loves me, but more important than anything else, I remembered who I was and why I was on earth. It kept me trying when I wanted to give up, and it helped me remember things like giving, learning, scriptures, and love.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ is the perfect example of one who understood His divine heritage. The scriptures tell us that in His youth, He “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52?lang=eng#51" target="_blank">Luke 2:52</a>). The more His understanding grew, the better prepared He was to fulfill His role as the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>We will not be called upon to suffer as Jesus Christ did, but to help us overcome our trials, Heavenly Father has given us tools that can increase our understanding of our divine heritage. From the scriptures, we learn how others have recognized their roles as sons and daughters of God and have acted accordingly. From living prophets, we learn of our divine nature and potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the priesthood, we can receive inspired blessings that remind us of our relationship to Heavenly Father. In the temple, we are instructed as we participate in sacred ordinances. Through prayer, we can obtain the help we need when we forget who we are.</p>
<p>And when I truly remember these things by receiving that witness once more, I am renewed. I gain new strength and new insight, and my testimony increases. I fully realize once more that I am working with the Lord in building His kingdom here on earth.</p>
<p>When we become members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we enter the waters of baptism and make certain covenants with the Lord. Some of them are to take upon us the name of the Lord, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments, and if we do these things, the Lord promises that we may always have His Spirit with us.</p>
<p>Thus, when we partake of the sacrament, we remember the past and contemplate the present as we recommit ourselves to follow Christ’s example in the future. It is comforting to know that we are not alone. We can receive help and strength from our Father in Heaven. Ammon recognized this fact when he said, “I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Alma 26:12</a>). As we add to our spiritual power through partaking of the sacrament and remembering Christ, we will find it easier to control our thoughts, feelings, and actions.</p>
<p>The definitions of the word remember include “to bring to mind or think of again,” “to keep in mind for attention or consideration,” and “to retain in the memory.” Remembering Christ, then, involves thinking of His teachings and His atonement for our sins. Concentrating on Christ and His atonement leads us to evaluate how well we are keeping our covenants with Him and making the effort to bring our lives into harmony with His teachings. This, in turn draws, us closer to the Lord as we enjoy the companionship of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Remembering the Lord also means getting to know Him. We can come to know Him by reading the scriptures, “feasting upon the word of Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:20</a>). Another way we can come to know him is by following his example. As our actions become more Christlike, we begin to understand His great love for us—and we begin to learn to love as He loves. Mormon taught that “charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47?lang=eng#46" target="_blank">Moroni 7:47</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me suggest three things you should remember:</p>
<p><strong>1. Remember to build your foundation on Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>In the scriptures, we learned of our Savior when He said, “I am Alpha and Omega, … the beginning and the end, the Redeemer of the world” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 19:1</a>). He also said, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/4.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">John 4:14</a>). In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.35?lang=eng#34" target="_blank">John 6:35</a>, Jesus said, “I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, wouldn’t we want such blessings? Wouldn’t we want such assurance? In the world of uncertainty and shifting values, we must have this sure foundation. We must build our foundation on Jesus Christ. He is the only way to true happiness, and there is no other way, so hold on to your faith and your testimony.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, I took two of my sons back to Tonga for a visit. There, we decided to fly to the island of Vavau to visit my brother. On the way back to the main island, we decided to take the boat for “site seeing.” It took us 16 long hours to get back, for we had to drop off and pick up people along the way especially from islands in Haapai. As we got to Nomuka Island, two guys couldn’t wait for the small boat to pick them up, so they jumped off our boat and swam ashore. An old and wise man turned to me and said, “This is what I call ‘TUKU E VAKA KAE FAI E KAKAU,’” a Tongan proverb that says, according to Brother Hafoka, “Forget the boat. Swim.” I wondered, “Why would someone leave the safety of a boat and swim? The boat was perfectly fine. There was no fire onboard or emergency, and though they could swim faster than the little boat, the little boat was still safer, so why would we leave the safety of the boat to swim?” Why would we leave the safety of the Church and try to find our own way and struggle, and suffer, and may not make it when the Savior said, “I am the way.” Brothers and sisters, unless the boat is on fire or has an emergency, we are still safer onboard, so stay onboard and don’t leave the Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Primary children remind us when they sing, “Keep the commandments. Keep the commandments. In this there is safety. In this there is peace. He will send blessings. He will send blessings. Words of a prophet. Keep the commandments. In this there is safety and peace.”</p>
<p>Here are four things we can do to build our foundations on the Savior:</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Press forward.</em></strong> Nephi explains, “Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:20</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Hold fast to the iron rod.</strong> </em>Nephi also said, “[The iron rod is] the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">1 Nephi 15:24</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Partake of the fruit of the tree. </em></strong>To partake of the fruit means to feel the love of God in your life. You can pray to feel that love, and you can repent, allowing the Atonement to bless your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Disregard those who make fun of you for doing what’s right. </em></strong>In Lehi’s dream, those who paid attention to the mocking people in the great and spacious building fell away. That building represents the pride and beliefs of the world. Because that building had no foundation, “it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">1 Nephi 11:36</a>). The pride of the world is temporary. Doing what’s right will bless you forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing these things will help you build on the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ so that when Satan’s hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down. Remember, we must build our foundation on Jesus Christ. He is the only way to true happiness, and there is no other way.</p>
<p><strong>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember that the Lord is bound when you do what He says.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular and attractive philosophies of men today is to live life your own way. Do your own thing. Be yourself and don’t let others tell you what to do. Do these sound familiar? The Lord tells us, “I am the way. … No man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">John 14:6</a>). “Follow me” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/9.59?lang=eng#58" target="_blank">Luke 9:59</a>). “What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:27</a>). As you can see, the world teaches the opposite of what our Savior Jesus Christ taught us. We have two choices: we can either follow the Lord and do what He says and have peace, light, strength, and knowledge, or we can follow someone else or find any other way and go alone—without His support, without His power, and without His protection. So ask yourself, “Which way is better?”</p>
<p>A story was told of troubled teenagers who visited a high security prison. They learned firsthand from the inmates. One of the inmates told them, “I’m 45 years old now, and I know I’ll never get to see the streets again. We’re all dying to get out, and you guys are pounding on the doors, saying let us in.” A convicted kidnapper told the boys, “I’ve been in here for 16 years, and you guys can’t sit still for a couple of hours. If you’re going to be criminals, you better get used to someone telling you what to do all the time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe that whether we are in prison or out, there is always someone telling us what to do. The difference lies in who is telling us and what they want us to do. Therein lies the difference between happiness and unhappiness, eternal life with God or some lesser glory. The difference is in obedience to the right voice and following the counsel of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it does not happen here at BYU–Hawaii, but I often hear people say they don’t want to be told what to do. Young people particularly often rebel against conforming to the rules and regulations. I have had some of them come to me and say that they are tired of being told to do this and to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They say they want to decide for themselves what they want to do. My response is that they are free to do exactly what they choose to do, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others, but there are consequences which follow all our actions, and they must be prepared to face those consequences. We are told, “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 82:10</a>).</p>
<p>A good example of this is found in a story I heard before. A young boy was playing baseball with his friends when his mother’s voice came loud and clear, calling, “Charlie, Charlie!” He instantly threw down his bat, picked up his jacket and cap, and started for home. “Don’t go yet; finish the game!” cried the other players. “I must go right this minute. I told my mother I would come when she called” was Charlie’s response. “Pretend you didn’t hear,” said the boys. “But I did hear,” said Charlie. “She won’t know you did.” “But I know it, and I’ve got to go.” One of the boys finally said, “Oh, let him go. You can’t change his mind. He’s tied to his mother’s apron string. He’s such a baby. He runs the minute she calls.” As he ran off, Charlie called back, “I don’t call it babyish to keep one’s word to his mother. I call it manly, and the boy who doesn’t keep his word to his mother will never keep it to anyone else.” Years later, Charlie became a successful businessman and president of a large corporation. His associates always said his word was his bond, and during a press interview on one occasion, Charlie was asked how he acquired such a reputation. His response: “I never broke my words. I did exactly as I was told.”</p>
<p>When the angel asked Adam why he was doing sacrifice, he said, “I know not save the Lord commanded me.” He basically said, “I don’t know why, but I just do what I was told.” Do you remember Helaman’s 2,000 stripling warriors? Their success was based on this same principle. “Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/57.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Alma 57:21</a>). They did “perform every word of command with exactness.” The key to their success was to obey every word and command. Yes, if we are going to draw upon the powers of Heaven, intention is not enough. We must obey every word of command with exactness. We must do what we are told.</p>
<p><strong>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember, you come here to learn and prepare to serve.</strong></p>
<p>When my daughter ‘Ofa, graduated from BYU–Hawaii few years ago, I asked her the question most parents ask their children when they graduate from college: “Now that you’re graduated, what are you going to do with your life?” She smiled with confidence and said, “What else do you expect? I came here to learn. Now I’m ready to serve. I’m going to serve a mission.” She served an honorable mission in the Auckland New Zealand Mission, and she is now attending BYU–Provo and serving faithfully in her YSA ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, my youngest daughter graduated from BYU–Provo, and after the graduation ceremony at the Marriot Center, we decided to go around and take pictures on campus. The picture I liked the most is the one we took in front of the school with the sign that says, “Enter to learn. Go forth to serve.” Please remember that you came here to learn, and when you leave this beautiful institution, you are to serve others.</p>
<p>One may ask, “How does service help me? How does it strengthen my faith and testimony of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? How does service increase our spirituality?”</p>
<p>Service helps us establish true values and priorities by distinguishing between the things of this world and those that matter most. Service changes people. It refines, purifies, gives a finer perspective, and brings out the best in each of us. It gets us looking outward instead of inward. It prompts us to consider others’ needs ahead of our own. Righteous service is the expression of true charity, such as the Savior showed.</p>
<p>Service helps us establish a righteous tradition. This is so necessary, particularly among young people. Wise parents will provide service opportunities in the home for their children from an early age. Growing up with this tradition will blossom into community service and Church service. It will develop a spirit of volunteerism in a world where people often ask, “What’s in it for me?” The Lord has counseled, “For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; … Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26-27?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">D&amp;C 58:26-27</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service helps us overcome selfishness and sin. Have you ever realized that all sin is selfish, whether it be lying, cheating, stealing, immorality, or idleness? Sin is for one’s own ends, not another’s—certainly not for the Lord’s ends. Service, on the other hand, is unselfish and constitutes a positive power for good.</p>
<p>Service is the principal way of showing gratitude to the Savior. We need to fill ourselves up with gratitude for His redeeming love, His infinite atoning sacrifice, His obedience to the will of the Father. As we increase our gratitude, it overflows into service, and “inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">Matthew 25:40</a>). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Charitable service helps us do as the Savior did, reaching out and helping, lifting and blessing, loving and caring. Service helps us to get to know the Savior, for “how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served?” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Mosiah 5:13</a>). As we immerse ourselves in the service of others, we find our spiritual selves and come unto Him. In all of these ways, righteous service brings us nearer to Christ, increases our spirituality, and brings others likewise. Such service will help prepare us for the coming of our Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we give Christlike service, it helps us grow spiritually and to put off the natural man and become a true follower of Jesus Christ, that is, one who is honestly trying to follow Him and do what He would want us to do. What a marvelous feeling it is to have the Spirit of the Lord poured out more abundantly upon us as we bear one another’s burdens and share with and mourn with those in need.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for your service because my children and family members have been blessed as you magnify your callings in your wards and stakes. I’m always interested in reading about thousands of our Alumni around the world and their service especially in the Lord’s kingdom. I’m forever grateful for this Inspired institution, for my experiences here at BYU–Hawaii many years ago that prepared me to serve. I love my Heavenly Father. I love my Savior.</p>
<p>May we <em>remember </em>to build our life on the sure foundation of Jesus Christ. May we remember that the promised blessings are ours when we do what He says. May we remember that we come here to learn and go forth to serve. May we remember that we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. May we remember that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, and He is our Savior and Redeemer. He lives. I know he lives. <em>May we always remember these things </em>is my hope and prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>July 15, 2014<br />Colby Weeks<br />Assistant Professor, Biology Department<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Thanks for the introduction. Brothers and sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>I‘d like to apologize in advance to the IT department. I told my mother about this, and I imagine she has spammed the entire galaxy about this Devotional. The servers may not be able to handle the streaming load!</p>
<p>I want to speak about part of our important mission here at BYU–Hawaii. We are a good school, and I am glad to be a part of it, but many of us, students, faculty, staff, and administrators, could be at more “prestigious” schools. Why are we here then? I believe this is a special place with very special people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to address your most powerful tool as students here at BYU–Hawaii and as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In my experience, this tool is underutilized at all of the BYU campuses, which I have been a part of in varying capacities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who are you? A son or daughter of God. That means something very special, but in reality, every person on earth can lay claim to that. What makes you different? The answer is that you know how to have contact with your Father in Heaven. You can pray to Him and receive personal revelation from Him through the gift of the Holy Ghost. Once again, this is available to everyone, but few actually receive it and even fewer use it. I find that so many people take this for granted in student life. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have a vested interest in your success on this campus and your life that will follow. The path for everyone is different, depending on careers and other circumstances of life, but the gospel is the same for everyone. I tell my students in biology to look to Heavenly Father for help in their studies. Why? Because God is the best biologist out there! He can help my students understand biology. He helped me as a student, and he continues to help me as a professor. One of the more spiritual experiences I have had in my time here in Hawaii was in my office. I was preparing a lecture about a subject that was outside of my expertise. I can testify that the windows of heaven were opened, and my thoughts were flowing with the understanding that I sought. The same thing can occur for any topic: &nbsp;accounting, biochemistry, graphic design, theater, computer science, anything. You have access to the best source of knowledge! Daniel and his brethren exhibited exactly this while they lived in Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Video]</p>
<p>King Nebuchadnezzar’s food was contrary to God’s commandments, so Daniel and his brethren would not eat. The story goes on to show that they did prove themselves and became favored by the king.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them &nbsp;[meaning Daniel and his brethren] ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Daniel 1:20</a>). Notice they received wisdom and understanding, not knowledge. You place the knowledge in your mind by various methods of studying. Knowledge is rarely deposited in the mind by the Spirit in my experience, rather you should expect to be led to new ways of understanding what you are learning. Daniel and his brethren lived worthily, and I know that many of you do as well. I share this story because it highlights that Daniel and his brethren utilized worthy living, and then they were blessed with greater wisdom and understanding in ALL matters. This is crucial to you as a student. In addition to all the knowledge you are learning here, you can learn to apply it through wisdom and understanding. The scriptures mention that Daniel and his brethren were promising young men, but because they were devoted to their beliefs, they ended becoming great men in the kingdom. Where will all of your training from your time here at BYU–Hawaii take you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devotion to gospel principles leads to receiving by the Spirit. It extends to all realms of life, not just for a class or a major. Any struggle in life can be answered, both trivial and serious. I’ll admit that time required for some things may vary from moments to lifetimes, but I know that there is a solution to whatever it may be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my oldest son was two or three, he lost something and was very concerned about it. Like any parent might, I taught that if he prayed for help and had faith, then he would likely find it with Heavenly Father’s help. He did find what he had lost, it was probably a toy, but the experience cemented in his mind that prayers can be answered. For months afterwards, he would pray for ANYTHING to be found. One time, he was praying to find some lost article. I do not remember what the item was. I want to say that is was a piece of a broken Pez dispenser, but I remember it being the most trifling thing. I had to restrain myself from laughing during his prayer because I considered it to be trivial. Of course, he found it! As he grows up, I see him applying this method in more powerful ways in his life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late night revelation as a parent is my favorite. We have a baby of seven months that likes to wake up at the worst hours. Sometimes, he struggles to go back to sleep. My wife and I have lost many hours of sleep to that little guy. One particular time a few months ago sticks out in my mind. It was my night to be on-call; my patience had run dry, and I was exhausted, and the usual means of providing him comfort were not working. I remember pleading that I could know how to help calm the baby, so I could sleep. A thought came to me. It was seemingly random, but it was a thought to do something I had never done before. I held my child's hand in mine rather just stick his pacifier in again or adjust his blanket. He quickly calmed down and was asleep in five minutes! It was a one-time deal though because it did not work in subsequent rough nights.</p>
<p>I mention these stories to highlight that God is there for each of us. There are obviously more difficult trials in life, but the principles can be applied in any situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does this affect you here at BYU–Hawaii? I challenge everyone of you to pray and fast about your studies, or a class, or even a test. Maybe you need help trying to grasp a difficult concept. Maybe you are struggling with a method of teaching a professor uses. Maybe you need to find a better way to study or learn. The answer is out there, and through devotion, the Lord can help you find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he shall direct thy paths</span>” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find a way to let the Lord <span style="text-decoration: underline;">direct</span> you. Instead of asking for an “A,” it is more powerful to ask for help to understand something or find a way to perform at your best, and then a good grade will come. I have a firm testimony of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers you seek come in a variety of ways, and I cannot expect to list them all here. However, I can tell you of a few ways it will NOT come. Many a prayer has elevated towards the “heavens” in the testing center only to figuratively reach the ceiling because there was not sufficient faith to power it. A quick prayer in the testing center, and no true preparation, is a sign of pride. You need to show humility and work HARD to prepare for the test beforehand. If you do not prepare, then you are relying on yourself and/or luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/17.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).</p>
<p>“Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the flesh is weak</span>” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/14.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">Mark 14:38</a>).</p>
<p>Help is promised in the scriptures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7-11?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7-11</a>)</p>
<p>Humility, the opposite of pride, will unlock the best side of you. Elder James J. Hamula mentioned this in his Devotional in June of this year. He said, “James wrote, ‘God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.’ The Lord taught the same thing to Moroni. ‘[M]y grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me.’” Elder Hamula continues, “Indeed, my brothers and sisters, the Lord’s grace is sufficient for you and me to obtain every needful thing” (“<a href="http://devotional.byuh.edu/media140603" target="_blank">His Grace Is Sufficient for You</a>”).</p>
<p>This leads me to the familiar quote by President David O. McKay from 1955:</p>
<p>“One man said the world needs men who cannot be bought or sold, men who will scorn to violate truth, genuine gold. That is what this school is going to produce. More than that, they’ll be leaders. Not leaders only in this island, but everywhere. All the world is hungering for them and best of all the world is recognizing them. How many of them are in the leading offices of our nation today? Count the number who are in the colleges throughout the land. I’ve been astonished as I’ve gone from state to state to meet the members of our church who are leaders in those colleges and universities of the land. A little church of a million, yes, that’s all we are, a million three hundred fifty thousand, but how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those members, representatives who are true to the ideals, will leaven the whole lot.</span>”</p>
<p>Leavening is the process of yeast making bread rise. We are much bigger as a Church now, but the same principle applies. How will you leaven the “whole lot” that surrounds you throughout your life?</p>
<p>I grew up in Northern California, which is where the famous Gold Rush occurred. Members of the Mormon battalion helped build a mill in Coloma, CA and subsequently discovered gold. When I hear about genuine gold that President McKay refers to, I always think back to the California Gold Rush. The BYU–Hawaii Gold Rush is ongoing. I have only been here a handful of years, but I have seen the great effect this campus can have on individuals and the Church.</p>
<p>Thinking about gold also leads to me to think about pyrite, commonly called fool’s gold. You can see it everywhere in California. I remember seeing it on many camping trips in rivers, lakes, rocks, and other sediment. As a kid, I recall being very excited about finding “gold!” The excitement faded as an adult explained to me that I had not found gold but fool’s gold. Nobody likes being fooled. Pyrite is a mineral that can be useful in some ways, but it isn’t as valuable as gold. It is not just the value of gold that is important but also that it is precious. Gold can be used because of its rare properties. It conducts electricity. As “genuine gold,” you can conduct the Holy Ghost into your life. I promise that other people will recognize that you are different. Testify to them of the gift of the Holy Ghost and that it can be theirs as well. Also, gold is malleable and can be shaped more easily than other metals. People who are genuine gold will be humble, similar to the malleability of gold. This allows the Lord to “direct thy paths,” as stated in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. I testify that your path will be directed. Sometimes, it is hard to recognize, but looking back on my life, I acknowledge that without being directed, I would not be standing before you today.</p>
<p>Gold, though rare and precious, can be misused. After leaving Egypt, the house of Israel struggled with this. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/32.22-24?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Exodus 32:22-24</a> says, “And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.” As genuine gold, be useful to the Lord and His Kingdom. Guard yourselves against falling into temptation and being misused by the adversary. Technology can facilitate the spread a private act of indiscretion across the world very quickly. When that act is associated with BYU–Hawaii or the Church, imagine the damage done.</p>
<p>The McKay quote says that you can become genuine gold. I have observed that many of you are becoming exactly that. What properties do you have that make you rare and special? Everyone is different, but one thing is that each of us can live the gospel to its fullest. This makes you rare and special. Now, I ask you to ponder how many of you are becoming genuine gold and will serve in the kingdom of God. What in your life might cause you to become “fool’s gold”?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Becoming genuine gold is a process. “But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/23.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Job 23:10</a>). This scripture shows that the process is not easy. You probably know that it is difficult. Maybe some of you are considering giving up for one reason or another. Please do NOT. The Lord needs you and wants you to succeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am no expert on the subject, but according to Google, raw gold needs to be processed. It is not precious and desirable in a sense until the processing occurs. It needs to be refined. This is done traditionally by what is called a refiner’s fire. The gold is heated to a high temperature. Any impurities are burned off, and only the gold remains. Chemical refining is used modernly. Small amounts of gold are leached from large amounts of rock. In either type of purification, the genuine gold has to be prepared and impurities are removed. Each one of us has precious worth, but we need to remove the "impurities." Life’s trials help this process.</p>
<p>How are you tried? In life, trials come in all shapes and sizes: callings, service, classes, culture, and people. By people, I mean students, roommates, administrators, staff, professors, and, mostly importantly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourself</span>. To progress, you need to learn from trial.</p>
<p>Another path towards becoming genuine gold is by taking advantage of the unique environment found here on campus. Spiritual opportunities are common here while on most campuses across the world these opportunities do not exist. Have you taken advantage of the Devotionals? I have attended most of them along with you in my time on campus. The messages always have something valuable to offer. An alum from my ward congregation works in town, and he expressed to me the disappointment he feels in his life on Tuesdays at 11 AM because he cannot come to Devotional. This is a special time in your life to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Do you remember old Devotionals? Are you now doing what was taught or, more importantly, what you learned by the Spirit? Take advantage while you can, and it will edify your soul. I am grateful to have been at each BYU campus, and I recognize the power of these opportunities. They helped shape who I am today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am old enough now to understand that Devotional messages have had an effect in my life. Early in my career, I wanted to work on cancer or research for a biotech company. I definitely did NOT want to teach at the time. Teaching was not emphasized much in my field 10-15 years ago. I was being groomed, like so many other scientists, for research, and I enjoyed it. Federal funding was plentiful, and the scientific research was growing. During recruitment for graduate school, the one guy who stated that he wanted to teach was the only 1 of 60 recruits who did not get accepted to the PhD program. Everyone was being prepared to research. Many factors have changed the focus on research, though it is still very important. The global downturn rippled through the economy. All of us were affected in many ways. Among many other effects, I was nudged in the direction of teaching, so here I am today and happy to be here I might add. I could be bitter or disappointed for not fulfilling my “dreams,” or I can accept that so much is out of my control. I would encourage you to continue to pursue your dreams, but I was able to recognize that my “dream” was not my dream at all. It was a plan I had made, and I know I could have been successful had it worked out that way, but it did not. I have learned to be flexible because the Lord had a different plan.</p>
<p>I would like to recall some recent Devotionals. I cannot mention all of them, so I will briefly mention a few that affected me personally. Elder Hamula last month taught about our weakness as humans and how we can do far more if we rely on the grace of Jesus Christ. Brother Lane shared insights on companionship and marriage. Brother Workman spoke of how to obtain and use divine guidance. Brother Bliss spoke of being honest. This is not earth-shattering news, and you could look at the title of the talk to gather as much information that I have given. Nevertheless, the messages left an impression on me, and they led me to make a change for the better.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the May 29, 2012 Devotional by Elder Gary L. Crittenden ("<a href="http://devotional.byuh.edu/media120529" target="_blank">Ponder, Liken, and Record</a>"). He instructed us to ponder, liken, and record during our scripture study. I took that message to heart, and because of his instruction, I now have pages of notes that are personal revelation. The topics vary, but several times, a running theme will start to come out of my studying the scriptures by pondering, likening, and recording. I consider this personal revelation to be very valuable.</p>
<p>One of the entries in my “Ponder, Liken, and Record” journal is from the October 30, 2012 message by Elder J. Christopher Lansing ("<a href="http://devotional.byuh.edu/media121030" target="_blank">That's Life</a>"). I would like to relate a personal story he shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Please forgive the personal nature of this story, but I think it highlights a message that I would like to leave with you. The business I own today was founded by my father, Ted Lansing, some 57 years ago. He died in 1980 from a terrible illness, ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, at the age of 57. I was the only family member involved in the business. At the young age of 30 I was probably not ready to take the helm of the company. The country was in a recession. In those early years, situations would come up that required me to make decisions which could affect the future existence of our frail business. In those years I worked hard to act as my father would have acted, and I spent a great deal of time on my knees, trying to discern his will. In all those decisions, I never once felt his calming influence or any direction one way or another. I would ultimately do what I thought was best and move on. But I confess that I was a little disappointed that I had not been able to get any confirmation of my actions.</p>
<p>“One night my father came to me in a dream. It certainly wasn’t a vision or anything like that; he was just in my dreams. When I saw him, I first told him how good he looked and how peaceful and happy he appeared. But then I began to chide him for his insensitivity to me when I had needed him most. My father said he was aware of the situation, but that he was too busy with his responsibilities where he was and that he didn’t have time. This wasn’t the answer I had wanted. I told him that I had been afraid for the business and had really needed his help. His answer to my criticism was what President Hinckley would have called a ‘soft answer.’ He said that where he was, the business was not terribly important and that he had assignments elsewhere. Again I asked him how he could be so insensitive. Finally, he said, ‘Chris, we really don’t care about the business up here. What we care about very much is what you become because of your business.’ What a great lesson for me, one that I hope I never forget.</p>
<p>“The message that my father brought to me is as pertinent to you as it was to me. The Lord has given you much. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you get is inconsequential. What you become makes all the difference.</span>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I share these parts of other Devotionals to highlight the wealth of spiritual blessings here on campus. Genuine gold happens here because of the environment provided, but also because of your effort put forth. I see you students working hard. I testify that your hard work will pay off. Elder Gerritt W. Gong of the Seventy talks about doing our best in this month's <em>Ensign</em>:&nbsp;"Given life's demands, students can learn that it is sometimes perfectly fine to do all they can and that it is not always possible to be the very best" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/07/young-adults/becoming-perfect-in-christ?lang=eng" target="_blank">Becoming Perfect in Christ</a>," <em>Ensign</em>, July 2014). Do not focus on getting a maximal GPA, but be and do your best, and success will follow in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My undergraduate years at BYU in Provo were VERY busy. I was single and practically living on campus. I went to class, researched, prepared for graduate school, and enjoyed the social scene. Apparently, I didn’t get enough out of the social scene because I met my wife a few years later in graduate school. I remember nights when I would come home exhausted. It was on those nights when I felt the Spirit sustaining me. Live worthy, take advantage of the unique spiritual blessings offered here, and you will become the “genuine gold” that President McKay spoke of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon leaving this university, a new phase in your life begins. I am old enough to see people live their lives and see the consequence of their actions. Many have been successful, some middling, and still others failing. I have lived long enough to see friends let go of the rod of iron and fall into the mists of darkness as depicted in Lehi’s vision. It breaks my heart. I am a scientist, and I must say that statistically speaking, some of you here will even though you just said in your mind, “No way. That’s not me.” I do not pretend to be perfect. I’ll admit that there are days where the only thing that I can think about are the dimensions on my next surf board instead of my family, work, my calling, or my testimony. I have other weakness as well, but I am also getting stronger as I live the gospel.</p>
<p>I testify that as you devote yourself to the gospel, you will be happier. Take advantage of the unique environment here on campus, especially the Devotionals, the CES firesides, etc. Let the gospel fill your life, and become better for it. Never stop. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>June 3, 2014<br />Elder James J. Hamula<br />Of the Seventy, President of the Pacific Area<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for the privilege of addressing you today. At the outset, I acknowledge why such a privilege has been extended to me. I am here not because I am an accomplished scholar, an experienced professional, or a noted statesman. I am here today only because I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, one who has been called and ordained to bear witness of His name (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.25?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">D&amp;C 107:25</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.139?lang=eng#138" target="_blank">124:139</a>). In that sacred capacity, I speak to you today and do so most humbly. Today, I desire to speak of Christ's grace and the sufficiency of His grace to make us fit to sit with Him in His celestial kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ – "Full of Grace"</strong></p>
<p>Of all the attributes of Jesus Christ, perhaps the most significant is that he is "full of grace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:6</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Alma 5:48</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/9.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">9:26</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.9?lang=eng#8" target="_parent">13:9</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank"> D&amp;C 93:11</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.6?lang=eng#5" target="_parent">Moses 1:6</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">5:7</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.52?lang=eng#51" target="_blank">6:52</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">7:11</a>). In the scriptures, the term "grace" is sometimes used to mean comeliness or physical beauty (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">James 1:11</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/esth/2.15-17?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">Esther 2:15-17</a>). No doubt, Jesus is full of grace in this sense, given his possession of all virtue and virtue's beautifying effect on physical appearance. But in the scriptures, the term "grace" most often refers to the divine disposition and power to bless, bestow gifts, or otherwise act favorably towards man (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/15.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">Acts 15:11</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/12.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Romans 12:5</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank"> 1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:7</a>). The LDS Bible Dictionary puts it this way: "The main idea of the word [grace] is divine means of help and strength." "Grace" is "an enabling power"; it enables the recipient to do and to be what he cannot do and cannot be if left to his own means.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Divine Expectation of Man</strong></p>
<p>All of us are in need of such an enabling power. We are the sons and daughters of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/17.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">Acts 17:29</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Romans 8:16</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank"> D&amp;C 76:24</a>). As such, we have the potential to become like Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/3.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Genesis 3:22</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/gal/4.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Galatians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/3.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Revelation 3:21</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.107?lang=eng#106" target="_blank"> D&amp;C 88:107</a>). Indeed, God desires that we be "partakers of the divine nature" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:4</a>) and become like Him. As Jesus said to His disciples, "I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">3 Nephi 12:48</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Matthew 5:48</a>). And on another occasion, Jesus clearly set forth the divine expectation for man: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:27</a>). Paul taught the same thing. He taught that Christ embodied the fullness of God (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/col/2.9?lang=eng#8" target="_parent">Colossians 1:19, 2:9</a>), and that men too should be "filled with all the fulness of God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/3.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Ephesians 3:19</a>). Indeed, Paul said this was the very purpose of the Church: to perfect the saints, to help them attain "unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12-13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:12-13</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Man's Incapacity in Spirit and Body</strong></p>
<p>While it may be expected that we achieve the "fulness of Christ," we simply cannot do so on our own. Each of us is made up of two things – an eternal spirit and a mortal body (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Abraham 3:18</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank"> D&amp;C 88:15</a>). Our eternal spirit comes into the world a product of choices made in the pre-mortal world. These pre-mortal choices form our personality, character, and spiritual intelligence. Significantly, no two of our spirits is the same (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Abraham 3:19</a>). Each spirit possesses a different degree of spiritual intelligence, or light and truth (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:36</a>), according to his or her pre-mortal choices. While each of our spirits may arrive in its mortal body at birth clean and pure, and even noble and great, no one of our spirits is yet perfectly developed unto the "fullness of Christ." Perfection of spirit may be pursued during the schooling of mortality and the additional experience of the spirit world (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">D&amp;C 130:18-19</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.30-37,%2058-59?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">D&amp;C 138:30-37, 58-59</a>), but perfection of spirit is not finally accomplished until the resurrection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the current imperfection of our spirits, our mortal bodies also are imperfect. As wondrous as they are, our mortal bodies are subject to decay, deterioration, and death and present desires, appetites, and passions previously unknown to us. Under such conditions, it is enormously difficult to fully subject the body to the will of the spirit. Too often, the spirit succumbs to the dictates of the body. Some of the greatest spirits who have come to earth have struggled to subdue their physical bodies. "[M]y heart sorroweth because of my flesh," cried Nephi. "I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.17-18,%2027?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">2 Nephi 4:17-18, 27</a>). Paul cried out in a similar way: "O wretched man that I am!" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/7.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">Romans 7:24</a>). "I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will[,] is present with me; but how to perform that which is good[,] I find not. For the good that I would[,] I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. … I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my [body], warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my [body]" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/7.18-19,%2022-23?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Romans 7:18-19, 22-23</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The war between spirit and body referred to by Paul is made all the more difficult by another fact of mortality. Our physical bodies are constructed of the materials of a "fallen" world, which gives Satan a particular "power to captivate" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:29</a>). Interestingly, Mormon observed that, for the three Nephites to tarry on earth and continue their ministry, a "change [was] wrought upon their bodies" so that "Satan could have no power over them, that he could not tempt them" and "that the powers of the earth could not hold them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.36-39?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">3 Nephi 28:36-39</a>). This suggests that absent such a change, Satan does have power over our bodies and the powers of the earth can hold us. Perhaps for this reason did Brigham Young make the following observation: "Do not suppose that we shall ever in the flesh be free from temptations to sin," he said. "Some suppose that they can in the flesh be sanctified body and spirit and become so pure that they will never again feel the effects of the power of the adversary of truth. Were it possible for a person to attain to this degree of perfection in the flesh, he could not die neither remain in a world where sin predominates. … I think we shall more or less feel the effects of sin so long as we live, and finally have to pass the ordeals of death” (<em>In Journal of Discourses</em>, 10:173).</p>
<p><strong>The Divine Power of Grace</strong></p>
<p>As imperfect spirits housed in mortal bodies, we cannot possibly acquire the full stature of Jesus Christ on our own. We need a divine power that can transform our souls with all of our current weaknesses and deficiencies into gods with all of the accompanying strengths, virtues, and capacities. Gratefully, such a divine power exists (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:3</a>); it is God's grace. Only through the endowment of God's grace are we "added upon" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Abraham 3:26</a>), such that, in time, we attain the "fullness of Christ." &nbsp;Indeed, this is exactly how Christ attained his fullness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Christ may be "full of grace," He has not always possessed the fullness of his present glory. In a remarkable revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, found in Section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, Jesus taught the following concerning Himself, by quoting a lost record of John:</p>
<p>"John saw and bore record of the fulness of my glory, ... and he bore record, saying: I saw his glory, … And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace; … he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness; And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son. And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father; And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.6-7,%2012-17?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:6-7, 12-17</a>).</p>
<p>Please note that Jesus continued from "grace to grace" until he received a fullness and for this reason is called the Son of God. And note too that Jesus' fulness came after his receipt of the Holy Ghost and that the power he received was the Father's. Because the Father is also "full of grace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/66.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">D&amp;C 66:12</a>), it makes sense that Christ would receive grace from the Father.</p>
<p>Why did Jesus provide us this insight concerning Himself? He answers that question in the same revelation:</p>
<p>"I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness. For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>Please note that Jesus gave us these lost portions of John's testimony so that we would "know how to worship" and "know what [we] worship." In other words, Jesus wants us to know Him, and we know Him by knowing how He came to be who He is. Further, when we know how He came to be who He is, we begin to understand how we might do the same thing He did to become who He is. Indeed, Jesus wants us to pursue the same path he walked, so that we may become what He is. He wants us to know that we too can receive "grace for grace" as He did and that we too can receive of the fulness of the Father just as Jesus did.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How We Receive Grace</strong></p>
<p>How then might we receive grace? To answer that question, we first must understand how grace is granted. Simply put, it is granted "grace for grace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">John 1:16</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank"> Helaman 12:24</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.13,%2020?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:13, 20</a>). In other words, the divine power of grace is extended to us incrementally. The Lord has said, "I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">2 Nephi 28:30</a>). God extends His blessings to us in this manner to "try ... and prove" us (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">D&amp;C 98:12</a>). If we receive a blessing and live according to it, then "greater things [are] made manifest" unto us (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">3 Nephi 26:9</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Alma 12:10</a>). As the Lord told Joseph Smith, "he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">D&amp;C 50:24</a>). But if we treat casually, set aside, or even ignore the gracious blessings we receive from the Lord, then "greater things [are] withheld" from us (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">3 Nephi 26:10</a>). In such circumstances, we receive the "grace of God in vain" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/6.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>) and eventually "fall from grace" altogether (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:32</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/gal/5.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Galatians 5:4</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">Mormon 2:15</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord's incremental endowment of grace is enormously important for us to understand. The enabling power of grace does not come to us all at once. We do not overcome our mortal weaknesses and deficiencies overnight. We are not perfected and do not achieve the full stature of Christ in a day. Rather, the divine power of grace is given to us here a little and there a little. We "grow in grace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">D&amp;C 50:40</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">2 Peter 3:18</a>), meaning that perfection and the full stature of Christ is achieved only "after many days" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.62?lang=eng#61" target="_blank">D&amp;C 101:62</a>), "in the process of time" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Moses 7:21</a>), and in the Lord's "own due time" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35.25?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">D&amp;C 35:25</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:19</a>). All this suggests that we must learn patience and perseverance – patience with ourselves and others in our current weaknesses and imperfections, and perseverance in the unavoidably gradual process of growth unto perfection. The Lord of the vineyard is certainly patient and persevering as he nurtures the trees of his vineyard towards their full maturation (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.65-66?lang=eng#64" target="_blank">Jacob 5:65-66</a>). He certainly understands that only "by and by" can the fruit of his trees be harvested (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.42?lang=eng#41" target="_blank">Alma 32:42</a>). We would do well to be more like the Lord of the vineyard in our efforts to “grow in grace.” &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Faith</strong></p>
<p>Understanding how grace is granted helps us understand how grace can be claimed. The principles are several. First, we must exercise faith in Jesus Christ. As Paul told the Romans, "By [our Lord Jesus Christ] we have access by faith into [his] grace” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.1-2?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Romans 5:1–2</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:8</a>). We cannot lay claim to the enabling power of grace if we do not believe that Jesus Christ lives, that He is "full of grace," and that He is willing and able to deliver to us His grace. At a minimum, we must have hope in the "exceeding riches of his grace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:7</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/1.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">1 Timothy 1:14</a>). If we have hope, then we will be moved to act. And when we act on hope that is founded on truth, we will most assuredly receive, in due course, confirming witness. Truth, hope, action, and confirming witness are the essential elements of faith and are the pathway to receiving the Lord’s grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider, for example, Peter’s experience of walking on the water to the Lord. Like our lives at times, Peter and the disciples were in the midst of a tempestuous sea. Jesus came to them, walking on the water and bidding them to come to Him. Seeing their Master on the water, the disciples were troubled. "Be of good cheer,” said Jesus. “[I]t is I; be not afraid" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/14.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Matthew 14:27</a>). With hope, Peter came down out of the boat into the boisterous sea and walked towards the Lord. His hope in Christ, coupled with determined action, permitted him to receive the power of walking on the water. But, looking at the storm around him, Peter doubted and began to sink. "Lord, save me,” he cried. In response, the scripture records that “immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand, and caught him" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/14.30-31?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">Matthew 14:30-31</a>). When Peter fixed his eyes on the Lord and acted in faith, he had power to do what he could not do on his own – walk on the water. But when Peter took his eyes off of the Lord and doubted, Peter severed himself from that power, was left to his own, and began to sink. Note well the response of the Lord to Peter's cry for help. "Immediately" did the Lord extend His hand to save him. Such is the availability of the Lord’s grace in time of need.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Repent</strong></p>
<p>Repentance is the second principle to claiming the Lord's grace. Alma proclaimed that "whosoever repenteth shall find mercy" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Alma 32:13</a>), which is a form of God's grace. Mormon taught the same thing: "[B]lessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved. And may God grant … that men might be brought unto repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace for grace, according to their works" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.23-24?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Helaman 12:23-24</a>). From these verses of scripture, it is clear that a repentant heart and good works are pre-conditions to the receipt of grace. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the example of Alma the Younger. He, along with the sons of Mosiah, were the "very vilest of sinners" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Mosiah 28:4</a>). When the angel of the Lord appeared unto Alma, he was confronted with all his sins and iniquities of his life. In that moment, he became "racked with eternal torment" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Alma 36:12</a>). "[T]he very thought of coming into the presence of my God," he said, "did rack my soul with inexpressible horror" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">Alma 36:14</a>). But Alma remembered that his father had spoken concerning the coming of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world. This recollection moved him to cry out in his heart, "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Alma 36:18</a>). Immediately, he “could remember [his] pains no more” and “was harrowed up by the memory of [his] sins no more" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Alma 36:19</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma's soul-wrenching repentance unleashed a power that cleansed and transformed him into a new creature (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.24-26,%2028-29?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">Mosiah 27:24-26, 28-29</a>). No longer did he seek to destroy the Church of God. Rather, for the balance of his life Alma labored to build up the Church by working to help others repent and receive the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.23-24?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Alma 36:23-24</a>). Alma the Younger's conversion from the vilest of sinners to prophet of God is a dramatic example of the power of the Lord's grace to both justify and sanctify every one of us (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.30-31?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:30-31</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">Moroni 10:33</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.24-25?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">2 Nephi 10:24-25</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be Humble</strong></p>
<p>The third principle to claiming the Lord's grace is be humble. James wrote, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/4.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">James 4:6</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">1 Peter 5:5</a>). The Lord taught the same thing to Moroni. "[M]y grace is sufficient for the meek, … [M]y grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.26-27?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Ether 12:26-27</a>). Making weak things become strong is the work of grace.</p>
<p>If humility is necessary for us to claim the Lord's grace, we might well ask what humility is. Briefly stated, humility is the submission of one's own will to the will of God and giving Him the honor for what is accomplished. In this regard, Jesus Christ is our greatest example. During His mortal ministry, Jesus always acknowledged that His strength came because of His dependence on His Father. Said Jesus, “I can of mine own self do nothing: … I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.30?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">John 5:30</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ's humility and submissiveness were perfectly manifested during his atoning sacrifice. "O my Father," Jesus prayed, "if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Matthew 26:39</a>). If humility precipitates God's grace, then it is no wonder that Christ’s perfect humility on this occasion unleashed the fullness of God's grace, thereby enabling Him to finish the work God gave Him to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do All You Can Do</strong></p>
<p>Doing all you can do is the fourth principle to obtaining the Lord's grace. As Nephi taught his people, “it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">2 Nephi 25:23</a>). Some may read this scripture to mean that God's grace is withheld until we have given our best efforts. I do not read it this way. There are simply too many examples of God's grace being extended to man without him doing anything for me to accept that narrow reading. The power of the resurrection, for example, is given to all by the grace of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.24-25?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">2 Nephi 10:24-25</a>), irrespective of individual effort. I understand Nephi’s “all we can do” language to mean that God's grace is extended to us when we expend our own best efforts. As Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, “The Savior’s gift of grace to us is not necessarily limited in time to ‘after’ all we can do. We may receive his grace before, during, and after the time when we expend our own efforts” (<em>The Broken Heart</em> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 155). In other words, doing all we can do is necessary to receiving grace; it is simply not a chronological pre-condition to receiving it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the example of the brother of Jared. He was instructed to build barges and use them to cross the ocean. Step by step, the brother of Jared followed the Lord's instructions. As he completed the barges, the brother of Jared became concerned about the darkness in the barges and asked the Lord to provide light. While the Lord could have readily provided the brother of Jared with a solution, the Lord asked instead, "What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Ether 2:23</a>). In response, the brother of Jared prepared sixteen stones, presented them to the Lord, and asked that He touch them so "that they may shine forth in darkness" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.1-4?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Ether 3:1-4</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brother of Jared had not completed all that the Lord had given him to do, but the Lord extended His power nonetheless in behalf of the brother of Jared, touching each of the stones and causing them to produce the light needed for the anticipated voyage. In so doing, the Lord showed His willingness and readiness to extend His divine powers to us as we do the best we can, even though our work is not yet fully done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keep the Commandments</strong></p>
<p>The fifth principle for claiming the Lord's grace is keep the commandments. “If you keep my commandments," said the Lord, "you shall receive grace for grace” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:20</a>). Moroni puts it this way: "[D]eny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if you deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind, and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32-33?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Moroni 10:32–33</a>).</p>
<p>Without diminishing the Lord's injunction to keep the commandments or Moroni's injunction to deny ourselves of all ungodliness, we should understand that grace is not necessarily dependent on our perfect compliance with them. If grace were dependent on perfectly keeping the commandments or perfectly denying ourselves of all ungodliness, our persistent imperfection in mortality would forever preclude us from acquiring grace. Grace is intended, after all, to enable us to more perfectly keep the commandments and pursue a godlier walk, until we attain the full stature of Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord's injunction to keep the commandments and Moroni's injunction to deny all ungodliness must be understood as doing these things the best we can. While our actions are important, more important are the intentions of our heart (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.6-7?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Moroni 7:6-7</a>). Thus, if we are less than perfect in keeping the commandments or in being godly, we may still be blessed if we are earnestly trying. Take for example the bestowal of spiritual gifts. The Lord has said that "they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">D&amp;C 46:9</a>). This is consistent with the Lord’s teaching that He “will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">D&amp;C 137:9</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.3-5?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Alma 41:3-5</a>). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Receive the Holy Ghost and Seek the Gifts of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>The final principle for claiming God's grace is receive the Holy Ghost and seek the gifts of the Spirit. The Book of Mormon records that as Alma the Elder baptized in the waters of Mormon, they who were baptized “were filled with the grace of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:16</a>). Indeed, we are filled with the grace of God when we receive the Holy Ghost, for it is the Holy Ghost who distributes and delivers to us God’s sanctifying, enabling, and perfecting powers. In this regard, Elder Parley P. Pratt taught the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The gift of the Holy Ghost ... quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands, and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates, and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity. It develops beauty of person, form, and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation, and social feeling. It invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being” (<em>Key to the Science of Theology and a Voice of Warning</em>, p. 61).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such blessings come to us as we receive the Holy Ghost following our baptism and confirmation. Elder Orson Pratt taught that “whenever the Holy Ghost takes up its residence in a person, it not only cleanses, sanctifies, and purifies him, in proportion as he yields himself to its influence, but also imparts to him some gift, intended for the benefit of himself and others. No one who has been born of the Spirit, and who remains sufficiently faithful, is left destitute of a spiritual gift. …These spiritual gifts are distributed among the members of the Church, according to their faithfulness, circumstances, natural abilities, duties, and callings; that the whole may be properly instructed, confirmed, perfected, and saved” (<em>Masterful Discourses and Writings of Orson Pratt</em>, comp. N Lundwall [1953], 571).</p>
<p>Significantly, as we receive the gifts of the Spirit, we become “partakers of the divine nature.” We take on the attributes, characteristics, strengths, and powers of God himself. Elder Orson Pratt continued to teach, “The only plan which Jesus has devised for the accomplishment of [the perfecting of the Saints] is through the medium of the spiritual gifts. When the supernatural gifts of the Spirit cease, the Saints cease to be perfected, therefore they can have no hopes of obtaining a perfect salvation.” &nbsp;It is for this reason, among others, that we are expected to seek earnestly the gifts of the Spirit (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">D&amp;C 46:8</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>). As Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said, the gifts of the Spirit “compensate for our inadequacies and repair our imperfections” (<em>Ensign</em>, September 1986, p. 72).</p>
<p>How do we obtain the enabling and perfecting gifts of the Spirit? Simply put, we ask the Lord for them. President George Q. Cannon once said, “If any of us are imperfect, it is our duty to pray for the gift that will make us perfect. Have I imperfections? I am full of them. What is my duty? To pray to God to give me the gifts that will correct these imperfections. If I am an angry man, it is my duty to pray for charity, which suffereth long and is kind. Am I an envious man? It is my duty to pray for charity, which envieth not. So with all the gifts of the gospel. They are intended for this purpose. No man ought to say, ‘Oh, I cannot help this; it is my nature.’ He is not justified in it, for the reason that God has promised to give strength to correct these things, and to give gifts that will eradicate them” (<em>Millennial Star</em>, 23 April 1894, p. 260).</p>
<p>President Cannon’s counsel is the same as Moroni’s. Concerning how we might acquire the Christlike attribute of charity, Moroni simply said, “[P]ray with all of the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Moroni 7:48</a>). Moroni also stated that this is how we “become the sons of God.” As we are endowed with charity and all other godly gifts, the day will come that “when [Jesus Christ] appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is” and be “purified even as he is pure” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Id.</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Sufficiency of God's Grace</strong></p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, I have taught today that Jesus Christ is "full of grace." &nbsp;I have taught that Christ acquired the "riches of his grace" from His Father and did so "grace for grace." I have taught that in like manner we may receive "grace for grace," and indeed are expected to do so. I have taught that if we pursue this course, we will be enabled to overcome every weakness and deficiency of the soul and be endowed with every attribute and characteristic of God. Finally, I have taught that this enabling and perfecting power of grace is available to all who are faithful, repentant, humble, diligent, obedient, and seeking of the Spirit and its gifts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you understand what I have taught, then you will appreciate the Lord’s repeated promise to all of His followers from the beginning of time to the present hour: “My grace is sufficient for you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/17.8?lang=eng#7" target="_parent">D&amp;C 17:8</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">18:31</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.78?lang=eng#77" target="_blank">88:78</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Ether 12:27</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.8-9?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 12:8-9</a>). Yes, the Lord’s grace if sufficient to lift you up from death and sin and to endow you with eternal life. It is sufficient to change you, transform you, and perfect you. It is sufficient to enable you to fully realize your divine potential as a son or daughter of God. The Lord told Adam, and all of us who are Adam’s children, you have a right to God’s throne, not of yourselves, but through His own grace (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.59?lang=eng#58" target="_blank">Moses 7:59</a>). We should, therefore, feel free to “come boldly to the throne of grace” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/4.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Hebrews 4:16</a>) and receive of the riches of God’s own grace. Ask Him for His gracious power to do and to be what you cannot do and cannot be on your own. Then do your very best. Do this, and you will surely receive His grace and, in due course, qualify yourself to enter into God’s celestial glory. Of those who are so blessed, the Lord has said, “They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things—they are they … who have received of his fullness, and of his glory; … they are gods … they see as they are seen, and know as they are known, having received of his fullness and of his grace; And he makes them equal in power, and in might, and in dominion” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.55-56,%2058,%2094-95?lang=eng#54" target="_blank">D&amp;C 76:55-56, 58, 94-95</a>). Indeed, my brothers and sisters, the Lord’s grace is sufficient for you and me to obtain every needful thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, may the grace of God the Father, of His Son Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost be with you, until the perfect day (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/16.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Romans 16:20</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.41?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">Ether 12:41</a>), I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Aloha. It’s good to be with you.</p>
<p>Jennifer and I have been married for nearly 21 years now. You see here pictures of when we were married, then ten years later, and then twenty years. (The last photo was taken by a member of the ship’s crew on a cruise in the South Eastern Passage of Alaska. At this very moment, we were watching whales.) Our life together has truly been an adventure, but as the idealized pictures don’t show, our marriage, as any marriage, has been a mixture of enjoyment, difficulty, laughter, disappointments, growth, good times, learning, and hard work. Of course, it’s occasionally required genuine exertion, testing and proving my manliness in strenuous activities such as cutting down the apple bananas in our backyard. Jennifer and I try to move ahead together, but lest there be any misunderstanding about who is the more emotionally and socially mature here, I’ll tell you that in February a few years ago, the little girl next door (then about three or four) brought by a Valentines card she had made for Jennifer and me. Jennifer wasn’t home, so I accepted the card at the door, thanking her very much. She turned to go home and said, “It’s for your Mom, too.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Doctrine and Covenants says that the Melchizedek Priesthood “holds the keys of the mystery of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God” and that “in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">D&amp;C 84:19-20</a>). Through these ordinances, we enter covenants with the Lord, covenants that are acted out symbolically in such a way to point to Christ, the way we should follow, and how we receive the merciful, enabling grace and power He has to give. They form a foundation and a road map for the life of a Latter-day Saint.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I grew up in a Latter-day Saint family. I was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church at age eight. When I was baptized, I didn’t fully understand all I was doing. I did know, however, that something important was taking place, that I should be different, and that I would be more responsible than before to try to be like Jesus. With that humble, even meager, beginning, the importance and meaning of that baptismal covenant, the symbolism of the ordinance, the way that ordinance orients our lives, the grace and power given, all of this has, through the years, been made more clear. I continue to find a depth and a wellspring of living water from it.</p>
<p>Similar experiences transpired when I had the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods conferred on me but especially when I was endowed in the temple. Much was clear from that endowment as to what I was covenanting to do and the greater responsibility I would now have, yet much was still opaque to me. But with continued experience, with study and prayer and attendance at the temple, the way this ordinance orients one’s life, the symbolism and meaning of this gift has been made clearer and continues to give more and more. I find that an insight here or there opens up further understanding and also other questions. The Spirit breathes understanding and meaning. There’s always more, and it continues to be, as the covenant is described, both new and everlasting.</p>
<p>When I was engaged to be married to Jennifer, the spiritual significance of the whole thing was impressed upon me. This was a profound undertaking—reaching into every aspect of my life. It wasn’t a matter of whether I was going to be active in the Church, striving to live the gospel. That wasn’t the question. It also wasn’t a question of whether I should marry Jennifer. I wanted to, and I knew I would be foolish—maybe even a little stupid--not to do so. But what was impressed on me was the seriousness of what I was deciding to do. As with the temple endowment, there was a step up in truly living a good, consecrated life, and here it didn’t just involve every aspect of my life but also the life of someone else. I was going to have to be different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember as we knelt across the altar, each one covenanting with God, accepting each other as husband a wife, the intensity surrounding the moment we were pronounced husband and wife and the overwhelming sense of joy, relief, accomplishment, blessing, responsibility, gratitude, love and then being given commands with respect to our marriage with the promise of joy and the promise of eternal life and the attendant blessings being spoken upon us. It was a simple ceremony, but like the other ordinances, I continue to experience and understand more of what this means and how it plays out in our lives.</p>
<p>If you haven’t guessed, I want to say something about marriage. Not about how to get married, how to find someone, how to have a successful marriage, etc. Instead, I want to say something about its place in following Jesus Christ, in making us more fully like Him, and in receiving all that God has for us. To do this, I want to ask a question or two now, have you think about it as I speak, and return to them later on in my address. I do not think what I have to say is the only thing that could be said about these matters, but I hope with what I say, and with your own thinking about this, to help us see the place of eternal marriage with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of (related) questions to think about: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it actually mean for a couple to be married in the temple?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What role does the ordinance of marriage play in our discipleship of Jesus Christ, in following and becoming like Him?&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Or better yet, how might you answer the student who, after we had discussed the basics of the gospel—how we come to Christ through faith, repentance and baptism, getting on the path and being made like him—asked (with what seemed a mixture of puzzlement and frustration at the requirement), “So why do I have to be married to get in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom?” Somehow the connection of being made into righteous, saintly beings and being married eternally wasn’t clear.) I’d like you to think about these questions with the hope that the Spirit will attend us so that I’ll have something good to say with respect to them and that (with the help of that Spirit) you’ll come to find good answers and deeper understanding yourself.</p>
<p>If you’ll follow along with me, what I’d like to do is describe the basics of discipleship and how we are made into Christ-like beings. Having laid that out, I’ll return to the place of the endowment and temple marriage in this larger scheme of things. To do this, I want to turn briefly to Nephi’s discussion of the Doctrine of Christ as the foundation for what follows.</p>
<p>When Nephi gets to the end of his record, he writes that he’s essentially said all he has to say except that he wants to speak some words concerning the doctrine of Christ. He then speaks of Jesus being baptized to show the way and to show his willingness to submit to the Father. “Thy will be done” ever marked his way of being from the beginning. (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31</a>.)</p>
<p>Nephi then remarks that if we are to follow the Son, we must keep the commandments of the Father by having faith in the Son, repenting of our sins and following Christ’s example and entering the waters of baptism. If we do this with real intent, acting no hypocrisy before God, having a willingness to take on us the name of Christ, the Father promises the same thing that was visibly bestowed in a sign when Jesus was baptized: He will give us the Holy Ghost. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:13</a>.)</p>
<p>Nephi then speaks of the necessity to endure to the end in following the example of Christ and that if we do this, the Father promises us Eternal Life (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.15-20?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:15-20</a>). Notice that when Nephi speaks of this process of taking on us the name of Christ through faith, repentance, baptism, and the reception of the Holy Ghost, he speaks of it in terms of a gate we enter—a gate that leads to a path, that path being a following of Christ, which we much follow to the end. Nephi then says, “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31: 20</a>).</p>
<p>We enter that path, willing to take on us the name of Christ. I understand this “taking on us the name of Christ” to be a willingness to become like him in goodness, righteousness, compassion, obedience, love, and holiness—to follow Him as we abandon evil and take on His godly way being, the Divine way of living, which is itself Eternal Life. To take on us the name of Christ, to be true Christian disciples, is to turn our hearts and souls to Him, so that through His atonement, we can be forgiven and cleansed of sin and also, by that enabling grace, be made like Him. That is to say, we are to continue with a steadfastness in Christ, a hope in Christ, and with the love of Christ (and of all people), feasting on the word—those things that will make Him central to our lives. Note that the gift promised to us—the Holy Ghost—plays an integral part in all this. We press forward on the path, striving to live the way that faithful, hopeful, and loving followers of Christ live. As we do this, we see that the Holy Ghost works with us and, as Mormon writes, fills us “with hope and perfect love” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Moroni 8:26</a>). These are spiritual capacities that we strive for but which are also a gift—something we find happening to us as we give our humble, heartfelt effort.</p>
<p>We enter the path, in other words, giving the best we can give and loving God with all we have and are. We follow the Lord’s command to partake together often of the sacrament, renewing our willingness to take on the name of Christ, thus retaining a remission of sins and striving earnestly day by day, week to week, to be more like our Savior. God blesses us, through Christ’s merits and power given through the Holy Ghost, to be changed, converted, made holy—taking on us the “measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:13</a>). This is the end and purpose of Christian discipleship. And, as Nephi says, “This is the way; and there is no other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the Kingdom of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:21</a>).</p>
<p>Having discussed this gate and path that Nephi describes, one might rightly ask how the other, higher ordinances of the temple fit here, particularly when they’re not explicitly mentioned in Nephi’s discourse. One way to think about this is to consider what might be meant by enduring to the end. We enter the path desiring and seeking to take on us the name of Christ—to be fully like him. The end of the path is Eternal Life, to finally not simply be with God and Christ but to be like them. Enduring to the end includes receiving all that God offers us to make us like Him, and that includes the blessings to the temple.</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee said, “The receiving of the endowment requires the assuming of obligations by covenants which in reality are but an embodiment or an unfolding of the covenants each person should have assumed at baptism” (<em>Teachings of Harold B. Lee</em>, 574). When we enter the path, we promise to take on us His name. Being well-established in the path, the Lord gives us a gift—an endowment—showing us more fully how to take on us the name of Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, note these words by Elder David A. Bednar (quoting Elder Oaks).</p>
<p>“Elder Dallin H. Oaks has explained that in renewing our baptismal covenants by partaking of the emblems of the sacrament, ‘we do not witness that we take upon us the name of Jesus Christ. [Rather], we witness that we are willing to do so. (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77?lang=eng#76" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:77</a>.) The fact that we only witness to our willingness suggests that something else must happen before we actually take that sacred name upon us in the [ultimate and] most important sense.’ The baptismal covenant clearly contemplates a future event or events and looks forward to the temple.” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/honorably-hold-a-name-and-standing?lang=eng" target="_blank">Honorably Hold a Name and Standing</a>,” <em>Ensign</em> May 2009)</p>
<p>While the covenant of baptism anticipates lives of obedience, of sacrifice, fidelity, and giving all that one has and is, the covenants of the temple make those more concrete or, to use President Lee’s words, embody those for us, creating deeper, more committed disciples, who in turn are endowed with God’s power to be better persons and to better carry out the work of His Kingdom in establishing goodness and holiness.</p>
<p>I return now to the question asked earlier: What does it mean to be married in the temple? What difference does it make? How does marriage fit in this path of discipleship?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the question of the difference it makes to be married in the temple, I’m guessing that nearly everyone has thought something along the lines of “Well, the marriage that is sealed there can last through eternity.” I agree that this is true, but that’s not all. It’s a necessary part but not enough. The question is what exactly is it that is supposed to last forever? Saying only that it lasts through eternity may not place the marriage clearly enough in its place in the gospel of Christ, of following Christ. Let me explain what I mean. To do this, I want to consider some of the good reasons (religious and not religious) why people might want to get married. To the degree that they are genuinely good reasons, Latter-day Saints would embrace them, even while seeing them as incomplete of themselves.</p>
<p>Many years ago, having returned from my mission a little over a year, I worked in a grocery store in southeast Idaho. A few of us (all men, some married, some not) were discussing married life and single life. One man, not a Latter-day Saint and not particularly religious, said, “One good thing about being married is that you don’t have to be lonely. If Friday or Saturday rolls around, you have someone to be with.” Now clearly someone can be married and still feel lonely because there isn’t in that particular relationship the kind of love and companionship possible, and it’s probably not a good thing to marry someone just to not be lonely. Nevertheless, if one thinks beyond just not being lonely, one can see the value of companionship, of having someone to share a life with. And though someone could share much of life with friends, neighbors, family, and so on, there is something desirable and good about having someone who loves you as husband or wife with whom you could share all of life. And, of course, Latter-day Saints will know that some aspects of life aren’t to be shared outside of marriage. Marriage allows that. These are good things but not yet sufficient. Eternal marriage isn’t only so you have someone to be with, to hug and kiss for eternity.</p>
<p>Many will see in marriage a blessing for society. Good marriages make for good families. Good families make good society. This is recognized by many, from Confucius, who saw filial piety as the foundation of a good society, to Shakespeare’s Benedict (in the play <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>) who, trying to give reasons for pursuing a romantic relationship with Beatrice (something his heart already desires), comes to this final, triumphant reason: “The world must be peopled.” The rearing of families and the good society that will come from them is indeed a good reason. It’s one Latter-day Saints would embrace and is probably one of the main reasons marriage and family are central to the Creator’s plan of happiness. I’m not certain, however, that it gets totally to the root of how marriage fits in our discipleship of Christ.</p>
<p>In many religious traditions, marriage is held up as blessed, helpful, divine, and immensely good. God blesses the marriage with a shared happiness and joy. Furthermore, the marriage causes one to get outside of oneself and can be very helpful in teaching the virtues of patience, love, compassion, work, unselfishness, etc. These virtues might be learned easily in a marriage where the very situation requires them. Of course, such virtues can clearly be learned in other places as well. As Latter-day Saints, we would agree that marriage and family are good places to become more loving and unselfish. Where our Latter-day Saint theology may differ is with its non-arbitrary place in the plan of salvation. We become something godly in marriage that we can’t become in any other way. Marriage is not simply one good way among others to receive all God has to offer or to be all that He hopes we will be.</p>
<p>Consider what it is we do when we marry in the temple for eternity. It isn’t that the Lord wants to pronounce the words “eternal” on just any kind of marriage. The temple marriage, in other words, is not just a good marriage that gives one companionship or simply a socially productive marriage with the stamp of “everlasting” on it. What God does want to pronounce eternal is the uniting in marriage of two followers of Christ—a marriage of disciples, joined in the cause of building the Kingdom, establishing Zion, bringing Christ fully into ourselves, our marriages, our families, and into the community and world in which we live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of what is required of those to be married in the temple. Before a couple is married, both are temple-endowed members, both have made covenants that their hearts and minds, all they have and are, will be consecrated to Him. Discipleship is not simply a part of their lives. It is the very center. The man and the woman are then joined in a marriage that unites their beings and their discipleship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord commands his people to be one, saying that if we are not one, we aren’t his. The baptismal covenant unites us to the body of Christ—the Church—and He commands that body to be one. There is a unity He requires of us as Saints. In the union of husband and wife, however, He creates a union, and therefore a discipleship, not possible with the other relationships. It is a sacred union, bringing both responsibilities and blessings. In marrying, we become something different, taking on a new identity if you will. I don’t know how fully to describe this, but you will know what I mean when I remind you how we talk about couples (and yes later, families, but couples for now) such as the Lanes, the Wheelwrights, the Kailis, the Lukovs, the Graces, the McArthurs, the Nemrows, the Mehas, the Fords, the Kesters, the Lesumas, the Rams, and so on. Consecrated lives are joined together to create a new union that both enjoys the blessing of the Lord and worships together and unitedly works to love and be good and take on together the name of Christ.</p>
<p>Notice this description by Elder Marion D. Hanks of the meaning of the temple and temple ordinances, including the marriage ceremony:</p>
<p>“The first and the last of Temple work relates to him [Christ]—the cleansing through his redeeming love (and the blessings), the symbolic journey back into the presence of the divine—all of this coming through the atoning sacrifice of the Savior who declared “no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">John 14:6</a>]—and the culminating moment at the altar when clasped hands point toward the indescribable love of the Lord in what he did and what he paid and what he suffered—in all of this there is only one theme, so far as I am concerned. Every stop along the way where we learn principles and make covenants relates us directly to him and the way he lived and the principles central to his holy life” (quoted in <em>Religions of the World: A Latter-day Saint View</em>, 269).</p>
<p>Significantly, the same things that are required of one and help one after the gate of baptism—that is, pressing forward with steadfastness in Christ, with a hope in Christ, and with the love of Christ, all the while feasting upon the word of Christ—are the same things that will propel this new creation, this new union of two, along the path of becoming like Christ. And just as disciples have the Holy Ghost to help and change them, so the marriage has the Holy Ghost to help and change and unify them, to make them like Christ.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">John 17:3</a>). Eternal life is to know Him, both knowing about Him but more knowing Him because, by the experience of following along the path, He has revealed Himself, and we have been made like Him. Note this passage from the Doctrine and Covenants, speaking about the gate and the law of marriage that leads to exaltation (so what’s being said here will apply to the married couple):</p>
<p>For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me. But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also. This is eternal lives—to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.22-24?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">D&amp;C 132:22-24</a>)</p>
<p>We receive and know God fully by (among other things) receiving all He has to give through the ordinances, including eternal marriage. We come to know Him fully, together as husband and wife.</p>
<p>I’ve brought us to marriage and therefore to the door of family. That is a talk for another day, but this lays, I hope, a foundation in thinking about why and how marriage fits in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>A uniting of a man and a woman, equally yoked disciples under covenant (and therefore under the obligations of the covenant, but also the blessings) is the ideal laid out in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. In saying this, I know there will be many who are not married but who want to be, some whose marriages are not ideal, and others who have, for good reasons, divorced. Such talks like this may, at times, be painful, saddening, or just plain annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand this completely. I was well into my thirties before Jennifer and I were married. I know what it’s like to want to be married but not be. Generally speaking, I was trying to be as good a disciple the years before I met and married Jennifer as I was after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, Jennifer and I have never been able to have children. There are some experiences and blessings, therefore, that we do not have. We see and know that, but we also know that the key point in all of this is to be committed, covenant-keeping disciples wherever we are, whatever the context—to be one with God, seeking to do His will here and now. The way will unfold in God’s own time and way; the crucial thing is to be following our Lord. While some blessings and responsibilities may be out of reach for now, God also opens up a multitude of doors for doing good, for finding joy, for being disciples and building His kingdom in our various circumstances. In all our living, ideal and not ideal, we will find that if we are established in our discipleship, pressing forward along the path, His grace is sufficient, His love overflows.</p>
<p>I testify of the reality of our Savior and His love. It reaches to all of us, whatever our condition. We follow Him on the path, individually, as friends and fellow travelers, as a Church, in our marriages, and in our families. I am grateful for the truth taught in the restored gospel that united as husband and wife we may follow Him fully and unreservedly on the path of Eternal Life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>May 20, 2014<br />Elder Dennis L. Sessions<br />Service Missionary, Coordinator for iLead and The Hub<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning and aloha. I want to give special thanks to my wife for her introduction. I truly believe we were prepared in the pre-existence to be eternal partners and to be given the family that we have. We are excited to have our son Eric and his wife Brooke and their son Bridger here with us today. We have always been very close as a couple and have worked together on everything, including our business, so it has been a great experience for us to be here on a mission and working together on our assignments at BYU–Hawaii.</p>
<p>I had no idea that when I got to know President Wheelwright as Elder Wheelwright during the time we both served in the Scottish Mission, approximately 50 years ago, that it would lead to my speaking in a devotional at BYU–Hawaii today. This assignment &nbsp;has weighed heavily on my mind for quite a few months as I have prayed for inspiration and for a message that I could present here today that would be of value to you as students. I have tried to prepare what I think are some of life’s basic lessons that are founded in Gospel principles and that can make a big difference in your life as they have made in mine. These are all principles that I have used and have tried to convey to my family, the employees in our business, and in my callings in the Church.</p>
<p>As I have worked with many students on campus in various capacities, I see that all of you have a great desire to do well in your classwork, church callings, and work on campus or at the Polynesian Cultural Center, but many times I see students that &nbsp;lack self-control &nbsp;and have difficulty getting everything done on a timely basis. Being away from home for the first time can present new found freedoms and the realization that no one is going to make you get up in the morning and be on time or check on you to make sure your homework is done. I remember my first year in college as a freshman, and my best friend and I spent a little too much time skiing during the winter and playing golf in the spring. But, we knew that we were leaving on missions in the fall, and we didn’t think about what the consequences might be when we returned to school in two years. I can honestly tell you here today that there were some consequences when we returned to school. So, for that reason I have entitled my talk today “Organize Yourselves; Prepare Every Needful Thing.”</p>
<p>The scripture that I based my remarks on today has always been one of my favorite scriptures and comes from the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.119?lang=eng#118" target="_blank">Doctrine &amp; Covenants 88:119</a>.</p>
<p>“Organize &nbsp;yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.”</p>
<p>When called upon to give a spiritual thought, I often use this one because it has so much to do with my success in life as a husband and father and in my church callings and employment. Let’s face it, if we are not organized, most everything we try to do will be some form of crisis management. &nbsp;I think we all know someone that fits into that category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how do we follow the admonition of this scripture and apply it in our lives. Let’s begin by breaking it down. First of all, it says “organize yourselves,” and like everything else, it begins with us as a child of God, brought to this earth to gain a physical body and to prove ourselves as individuals. Although we are born with many of our personal attributes, in many ways we become a product of our home environment and tend to follow the lead of our parents and others around us. Let me tell you a little about my childhood and the way I was raised. My parents were second-generation owners of a grocery and general merchandise store in Teton Valley, Idaho. In addition to the grocery store, my father also farmed and we raised sheep. So, as you can guess, there was no shortage of work for me and my siblings when I was growing up as a kid. It seemed like I was always either in school or at work, and I never knew what it was like to have a day off. At the age of ten, I also worked for my uncles on their farm in the summer time, usually driving either a tractor or truck as they loaded hay bales in the field. I started working for $1.00 per day, and by the end of the first summer, I had made some money. My parents set me up a savings account, and then at the age of twelve, they helped me set up a checking account so that I had control of my own money. That was long before the day of credit and debit cards. They did require that I put at least half of my earning into savings for a future mission and college. One of my earliest jobs in the grocery store was stocking shelves on freight day, and I was paid 5 cents for each case of product that I could mark with the correct price and put neatly on the shelf. If I worked hard, I could earn $1.00 from the time I got to the store after school and until it closed. Now, I am telling you all of this to help you understand why being organized is so important to me. I had to be organized to go to school, hold a part time job from about the age of eight, and keep up with my homework in school. As I got into high school, I was involved in football and wrestling after school, and then I still went to the grocery store until closing and then home to do my homework. From time to time, I would also have to be at the grocery store early in the morning before school to help out in the meat department, and I became a meat cutter in the process. I had to organize every aspect of my life so that I could do well in school, participate in scouting, and have a little time to go with my friends and have a date for the Saturday night dance. Since this was all back in the '60s, there were no computers, and until I could take a typing class in high school, my mother had to type all of my term papers and book reports. She taught me another principle that I have used many times in my life with my children and many other people with whom I have been associated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is “<strong>Do not let your lack of planning become my emergency.</strong>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, if she was going to type my book report, she would not be doing it late the night before it was due. I had to allow her several days to fit in the time to type it for me. It took pressure off both of us when I took a typing class and was old enough to type my own reports. Let’s hope all of us never let our lack of planning become someone else’s emergency. As a child and a teenager, my parents truly taught me to organize myself and “prepare every needful thing” as the scripture says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to the rest of the scripture, beginning with “establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.”</p>
<p>This now becomes our responsibility to establish our own “house of God” as outlined here. As you establish your own, you will then be prepared to do the same with your spouse and continue it on as you bring children into the home. It begins with our faith and our daily prayer, asking for the Lord’s help to accomplish this as you strive to create your own “house of God.” It also suggests a house of learning where we continuously learn from the scriptures, from the General Authorities through conference talks, and from other good books. Lastly, it suggests a house of order where we place a priority on all that we face each day and organize our time so that all is accomplished in a meaningful way, and we feel good about what we have done. This can be as simple as making a list on paper or in your electronic device, beginning with the most important task for the day and then prioritizing all the others. Then, be sure that we begin the day with prayer and ask our Father in Heaven for the help we need to accomplish all that we are faced with.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.74?lang=eng#73" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 88:74</a>, it reads, "And I give unto you who are the first laborers in this last kingdom, a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean.”</p>
<p>Then down in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.80?lang=eng#79" target="_blank">verse 80</a>, it says, “That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although this was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832, it applies to each of us today who is also part of the last kingdom of God to be established upon this earth in preparation for the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The reason why this university was established by a prophet, President David O. McKay, was to prepare young people, like yourselves, to go back to your native lands and build the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s reflect upon the words of President McKay at the groundbreaking ceremony for this great institution in 1955: “The world needs men [and women] who cannot be bought or sold, men [and women] who scorn to violate truth, genuine gold. That is what this school is going to produce. More than that, they’ll be leaders. Not leaders only in this island, but everywhere. All the world is hungering for them.”</p>
<p>Those of you here today as students are the men and women that President McKay was speaking of. You are here receiving the blessings of attending a special university set aside for the training and preparation of the future leaders of the Church throughout Asia, Polynesia, and the rest of the world. Based on the scriptures that I have quoted and the remarks by President McKay, the Lord has high expectations of each of you when you finish your education and leave this university. You will be sent forth to magnify your callings as spoken of in verse 80. You will become Elders Quorum presidents, Relief Society presidents, and even bishops and branch presidents. Having served as a former bishop at BYU–Idaho, I can guarantee that you will need to be organized to meet all of the demands on your time and still devote time to your spouse and family.</p>
<p>So let me give you a few of the basic tips that I used throughout my life to help me be organized and accomplish all of my daily tasks.</p>
<p>If you do not already possess the skills and attributes of an organized person, you can start with the following basics:&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, develop a daily routine of arising at the same time and using the time to exercise, have your scripture study, and prepare a list of the most important things you need to accomplish. Rank them in order from most important to least important. As each task is completed, cross it off the list. At night, just before you go to sleep, make your list for tomorrow so that you can be prepared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, be an on-time person everywhere you go, whether it be going to church or class or even meeting your date. My father-in-law had a sign hanging in his office that said, “<strong>I owe all my success in life to having been 10 minutes ahead of time.</strong>” Luckily, he taught that principle to his daughter, my wife, and so it has always been easy for us to make sure that we are on time. It was put to the test, however, when we were younger and had a young family, and we were busy getting four young children ready for church, but we generally made it before the meeting started.</p>
<p>Third,<strong> practice what you preach</strong>, or in other words, know what you stand for, and then live your life accordingly. Develop your own personal set of ethics, integrity, and standards that you are comfortable with and can live by for the rest of your life. Never waver from them, and they will define you as a person. If you tell someone you will do something, then make sure you do what you say you will do and make sure it is within the agreed upon time frame. Never let people down who are depending upon you.</p>
<p>It has often been said both in the Church, in the community, and in the work place that if you want something done right, ask a busy person, and they will get it done for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, become self-reliant. In the “Welfare Principles and Leadership” section of <em>Handbook 2: Administering the Church</em>, which is readily available for your viewing online at <a href="https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng" target="_blank">Lds.org</a>, we are given the following counsel:</p>
<p>“Self-reliance is the ability, commitment, and effort to provide the spiritual and temporal necessities of life for self and family. As members become self-reliant, they are also better able to serve and care for others.”</p>
<p>“Church members are responsible for their own spiritual and temporal well-being. Blessed with the gift of agency, they have the privilege and duty to set their own course, solve their own problems, and strive to become self-reliant. Members do this under the inspiration of the Lord and with the labor of their own hands.”</p>
<p>The Church needs people who are self-reliant and who can be available to help others in need. In order to build the kingdom of God throughout the world, future leaders, that is those of you here today, will need to be strong as an individual and a family and be able to support those around you that have both spiritual and temporal needs. That is why you have been given the opportunity to come to BYU–Hawaii and receive an education and become spiritually prepared to lead.</p>
<p>Let’s talk for a moment about how we use our time. Those of you that have served missions should recall that on page 137 of the <em>Preach My Gospel</em>, it discusses using time wisely. I have modified them for our use here as students.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">•&nbsp;How can goals help me be a more effective student?<br />•&nbsp;What should be the focus of my goals?<br />•&nbsp;What are my planning tools and resources, and how do I use them? <br />•&nbsp;How will I know if my goals and plans are helping to further the Lord’s work?</p>
<p>We are all given 24 hours in a day and are free to use them as we see fit. The patterns we develop now while we are away from home and the direct influence of our parents will set the pattern for the rest of our lives. Please think about the following statement by Elder Richard J. Maynes of the Presidency of the Seventy that he taught in an October 2013 Conference talk ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/the-strength-to-endure?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Strength to Endure</a>"):</p>
<p>“Heavenly Father has organized our journey through life to be a test of our character. We are exposed to both good and evil influences and then given the moral agency to choose for ourselves which path we will take. As the ancient Book of Mormon prophet Samuel taught, "Ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free."</p>
<p>Then think about this quote from Viktor E. Frankl from his book <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>.</p>
<p>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Helaman 5:12</a> in the Book of Mormon, Nephi and Lehi are busy preaching the Gospel and are invited to pattern their lives after their forebears.</p>
<p>“And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation where on if men build they cannot fall.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to reaffirm how important it is that we organize ourselves and prepare every needful thing, build our lives upon the rock of our Redeemer Jesus Christ, and to develop a plan for our lives that will provide for the success of our family and make us an instrument in the hand of God to build His kingdom throughout the world. That is why we are here at BYU–Hawaii, to prepare us for that responsibility. Consider the words of President Henry B. Eyring, first counselor in the First Presidency, about becoming a light unto the world ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony?lang=eng" target="_blank">A Living Testimony</a>," General Conference April 2011):</p>
<p>“Each time you choose to try to live more like the Savior, you will have your testimony strengthened. You will come in time to know for yourself that He is the Light of the World. … You will reflect to others the Light of Christ in your life.”</p>
<p>I bear testimony that the Lord has put us on this earth to test us and give us the opportunity to pursue what we desire in life. We can all become an instrument in His hands to raise righteous families and to build the Kingdom of God. It is all up to us as individuals to see how well we can organize ourselves and prepare every needful thing as spoken of in the Doctrine and Covenants. I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and that President Monson is a true and living prophet. May the Lord bless each of us as we journey through life, and may we all stay on the path of righteousness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>May 13, 2014<br />Elder Joel Madsen<br />Service Missionary, Campus Planning<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, Aloha! I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you today. It has been a wonderful experience for us to serve as senior missionaries for the past two years here at BYU–Hawaii. We both enjoy working in the Campus Planning and Construction office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been equally rewarding to serve as mentors and instructors in the Hale La’a Young Single Adult ward here on campus. We have come to love the young men and women we associate with here in Laie. You never cease to amaze us. The high quality of character and maturity that most of you demonstrate as you go about your studies is remarkable and inspiring. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>We also wish to mention a word of admiration for the dedication and commitment of our fellow senior missionaries. We have never known a more dedicated group of devoted servants of the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, we recognize the service and commitment of the university staff, the administration, and the faculty. We have witnessed their conscientious efforts as they go about their daily responsibilities to provide an excellent educational experience for all who enter here.</p>
<p>Speaking of responsibility, it reminds me of a story I heard some time ago of an individual who was a bit reluctant one morning to meet his commitments. It went something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The kind motherly figure entered the darkened bedroom and gently said, "Get up Donald. It’s time to get ready for school."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The silent figure didn't move at first and then quietly turned over, pulling the covers up over his head.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With a firm tone in her voice, she said, “Donald, get up right this minute. Your breakfast is getting cold, you're going to miss the bus, and you'll be late for school."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Pulling the covers back down, Donald turned over and replied, “I don't want to go to school! Nobody likes me. The kids make fun of me, and even my teachers all hate me."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Now Don, stop making excuses. You must go to school. You have responsibilities and you have made commitments. Besides, you're forty years old, and you're the school principal. Now get up and get dressed."</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t suppose there are any sitting on the stand behind me who have felt this way at times throughout their career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am certain we can never thank them enough for their dedicated service in the past and their continued vision and guidance as they lead us into the future… our future. May the Lord bless them for their devotion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Peek at the Future</strong></span></p>
<p>I am delighted to be part of the development team overseeing the renovation of our iconic dormitories that were built long ago by labor missionaries. Several months ago, we received approval from Church headquarters to proceed with the redesign and engineering of four existing dormitories. The design work was recently completed, and President Wheelwright has given me permission to share the architect’s renderings for the next phase of development. We expect construction funding to be approved in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Hale 3, 4 and 5 will have a third floor added that will increase student occupancy. Hale 6 will be completely taken down and replaced with a new structure built up out of the flood zone. The living quarters in all four buildings will be redesigned as three bedroom apartments, each having its own kitchen and private bathroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campus will be beautified with new landscaping around the tennis courts and a pedestrian walkway that will connect the entire single student housing community to a beautiful new courtside park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, we think you are really going to love the improvements!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forty-Seven Years Ago</strong></span></p>
<p>In some ways, I am jealous of you because it hasn’t always been this nice and convenient. I know because I was a wide-eyed freshman here forty-seven years ago when this institution was relatively new. At that time, it was named the Church College of Hawaii.</p>
<p>I would like to share a few photos with you, so you can see how things were back then in the olden days.</p>
<p>I remember waiting in the San Francisco airport for my first ever flight on a jet airliner to Honolulu, Hawaii. The cost of a student standby airline ticket was only $75 dollars back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, some of us actually arrived at college wearing a sport coat and tie in 1967. And yes, believe it or not, I did have a lot of naturally blonde hair on my head at that time.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, I was assigned to Hale 4, sharing a dorm room with seven other roommates. We each had our own bed and a curtain for privacy but not much else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My part-time job after classes was maintaining the lawn and yard for the entire TVA apartment complex, by myself, which at the time consisted of nothing more than two military-style, wood buildings with about six apartments each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to my academic studies, I also managed to learn firsthand why one of our local beaches is called “Pounders,” and before I returned home, I was able to experience the thrill of riding a few waves.</p>
<p>The reason I decided to share this brief look at the past is to let you know that even the senior missionaries were once young like you, and some of us have walked the very same path before you. We know what it was like to be a young freshman arriving from overseas and not knowing anything about college life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We experienced the same sticker shock at the high cost of textbooks, the same culture shock of having a roommate from another country, the same worry about pop quizzes and final exams, and the same joy and satisfaction at doing well in our studies.</p>
<p>We felt the same homesickness for our family, our friends, and our favorite food. We also remember what it was like finally becoming an upper classman and looking forward with great anticipation to graduation and our first real career employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having traveled similar paths in a bygone era, perhaps we can share a small portion of the insight and knowledge we have gained to assist you on your educational and social journey here at BYU–Hawaii.</p>
<p>The message we would like to convey this day revolves around a very important subject: the multiple aspects of communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Communication in College and Career</strong></span></p>
<p>As part of your liberal arts education, you will be exposed to many new subjects that will deepen your understanding and broaden your view of the world. You will be required to learn facts, figures, concepts, and formulas in your fields of study. Some of it will be interesting, and some of it will bore you to tears. All the hours of listening, reading, speaking, and writing to fulfill your assignments over the course of several years are aimed at helping you become a well-rounded individual and a contributor to society.</p>
<p>The success you achieve in college will depend not only on how earnestly you apply yourself to learning but equally on how well you develop the ability to communicate your new found knowledge. During college, you will be called upon to demonstrate this skill in the form of class discussions and examinations, both oral and written. After college in the work place, it will be required of you in the form of communicating with your employer, your associates, and your clients. No matter how smart you are or think you are, success in your career will largely depend on how reasonably, persuasively, and effectively you can convey your thoughts and ideas to others.</p>
<p>Much of the knowledge you gain here will be forgotten or perhaps never put to actual use again in your life after college, but what will be of great value while you are here in college and afterwards throughout your entire life is the ability to solve problems and to communicate your solutions to those you work with. Moreover, good communication skills will enable you to develop empathy and connect with your associates in a way that motivates and engenders their cooperation and loyalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what will make you a valuable and irreplaceable employee or business enterpriser. This is what will make you an excellent husband or wife and a good father or mother. This is what will help you become a leader in the Church and in your community.</p>
<p>Learn the skill of oral and written communication to the best of your ability. It will serve you well in the future.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Social Communication</strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to mastering communication skills in the academic and business world, it is becoming more and more apparent we need to master our communication activities on a personal and social level.</p>
<p>We live in a very complex and fast-paced world nowadays. In the space of our lifetime, we have witnessed many lifestyle changes. I remember back to my childhood days growing up in Bountiful, Utah where we had a party telephone line. How many of you young people know what a party line is? When telephones first became commercially available, they were only found in public places. By the 1950s, many households had their own telephone, but it was connected to a shared system along with all the other houses on a particular street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you needed to make a phone call, you would pick up the telephone and first listen to hear if anyone else was using the line. If not, you could dial the number. If the line was occupied by someone else, you had to wait until the other caller finished. Needless to say, you and your neighbors knew quite bit about each other’s personal lives while sharing a party line.</p>
<p>Little by little, more private lines became available. Today cell phones, the internet, instant messaging, and video conferencing have almost made the landline telephone obsolete… except in the case of my wife Sheila. This past Christmas, our daughter Laura found a clever way to allow Sister Madsen to combine old technology with her smart phone and in some small way remain connected to the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Sister Madsen can carry her iPhone in her purse and still pick up the handset to talk to her mother just like she has all her life.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting you follow her example or that you abandon your smart phone altogether. However, we do advise that we all learn to discipline and control our use of wireless and internet technology. A balanced life requires there be moderation in all things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I refer back to General Conference a few short weeks ago where Brother Randall L. Ridd reminded us that “owning a Smartphone does not make you smart, but using it wisely can.”</p>
<p>He further stated, “As important as it is to leave home every day with a full charge on your cell phone, it is far more important to be fully charged spiritually. Every time you plug in your phone, use it as a reminder to ask yourself if you have plugged in to the most important source of spiritual power—prayer and scripture study, which will charge you with inspiration through the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Communication in Dating and Courtship</strong></span></p>
<p>For the next few moments, I would like to direct our attention toward another very important subject.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">•&nbsp;How many of you are currently single? By that I mean unmarried. Please raise your hands.<br />•&nbsp;How many of you plan to get married someday? This is a very important and worthy goal.<br />•&nbsp;Now, how many of you are actively dating at the present time?&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp;How many of you have been on a real date this past week?&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Wheelwright, there appears to be something missing here. These young men and women seem to believe they are going to marry someone without ever dating. That would be like someone believing he is going to graduate without going to class and completing his assignments.</p>
<p>All teasing aside, I would like to share a few secrets about dating and courtship.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1)&nbsp;You will only marry someone you date. </strong>I don’t know of any couple who married without dating first. And for the record “hanging out” is not considered a real date. To be precise, the traditional definition of dating is “a form of courtship consisting of social activities among two people of the opposite sex with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a marriage partner.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2)&nbsp;To find the right one, you must first date the right kind. </strong>You will never find the right one if you don’t socialize with the right kind, so don’t go looking for love in all the wrong places. Associating with the right kind of individuals will greatly increase your chances of finding the one that is right for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3)&nbsp;There is no perfect “soul mate” for you. </strong>Those who continue to hold out for Prince Charming or Miss Universe may find themselves waiting a lifetime. By design, perfection does not exist in this mortal life. My personal belief is there are a number of potential marriage companions with whom each of us could make happy lives and homes together. The notion of a one and only soul mate is a romantic idea, but in reality, there are many who could fit the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides offering you a great education, I hope you unattached upper classmen and women realize that one of the most significant opportunities this university provides you is the chance to find your future mate, your life long companion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, you won’t find it written in the university mission statement, the motto, or the Honor Code, but I assure you the Lord knows that this is the moment in time when you are making major decisions regarding your education, your career, and perhaps finding your future husband or your wife. College is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will never come around again for most of you. If you don’t take advantage of it, I promise you will look back on these years at BYU–Hawaii with some regret.</p>
<p>Where else in the world can you mix and mingle with others your same age, with the same religious beliefs, with common goals and aspirations? Nowhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the entire world population as a whole, the Latter-day Saints make up approximately one quarter of one percent of the total population. This means that only 1 out of every 400 people will think like you, believe like you, have the same ideals as you, and know about God’s plan of happiness for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here at BYU–Hawaii, everyone shares our common beliefs.</p>
<p>Dating doesn’t have to be expensive. Find cheap dates. Go on double dates. Learn to communicate face-to-face with the opposite sex not only through text messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, the boys take the lead setting up a date. However, resourceful young women can also find appropriate ways to get to know the young men on campus. I know of one young lady who always seemed to be standing in just the right place after church meetings or after class where she knew a certain young man would be passing. She would offer a cheerful hello and ask him how he was doing, which led to a casual conversation. Soon they were dating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expressing an interest in someone through common friends is another effective way to get acquainted with each other. Attending Family Home Evening and other church and school activities are also good ways to start dating.</p>
<p>Don’t let your shyness get in the way. Build up your courage and then move forward with faith.</p>
<p>Don’t set your expectations too high regarding outward appearances and worldly things. In the long run, those things will change and all fade away. First, focus on inward attributes such as character and courtesy, responsibility and reliability, testimony and faithfulness. These are the things that matter most.</p>
<p>Many of you underclassmen may not feel ready for dating, courtship or marriage. That is understandable. There is no rush. Be patient and your time will come. Someday, the love bug will bite you too. Meanwhile, take advantage of the opportunity to socialize and make friends while you are here in this environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you upperclassmen are worried about a career or not having enough resources to support a wife, and therefore, you are not seriously considering courtship and marriage. That also is understandable, but keep in mind that where there is a will, there is a way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put myself through college without any help from my family or anyone else except the bank. I worked odd jobs every semester and each summer to get through college. I did many types of work including construction, delivering groceries, and digging graves at the cemetery by hand with pick and shovel. I also installed lawn sprinkler systems.</p>
<p>Soon after returning from my mission, I installed a sprinkler system for a Bernina Sewing machine distributor. The manager couldn’t afford to pay me in cash, so I took part of my compensation in trade. Upon completion of the project, I became the proud owner of a brand new Bernina sewing machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long before I had a wife, I was preparing for my future wedding day. I knew that someday I would be married, and this fine sewing machine would make an excellent wedding gift for my then unknown bride whoever she may be. I moved and stored that sewing machine for three more years before I finally found her.</p>
<p>I finished college in Utah in the spring of 1973 in debt with several student loans and without a fulltime job. Nonetheless, later that summer, my sweetheart and I were married and sealed in the Salt Lake temple. Neither of our families had the financial resources to help much with our wedding reception. We rented the cultural hall at the institute of religion for all of fifty dollars. We had the smallest and simplest wedding cake you can imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We couldn’t afford to provide dinner for our guests, so we served them sheet cake with a tiny cup of mixed nuts and sparkling punch. Our wedding invitations were not engraved but were printed on plain card stock by an eighty-year old member of my home ward who had been a printer in his younger years. He still had an old fashioned printing press at his shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember watching him set the type one letter at a time and then slide each blank card on and off the press every few seconds as it opened and closed. At his advanced age and with his failing eyesight, I worried that he might get his hand caught in the press. My fears were unfounded as the old pro confidently moved his hands in and out of the press in rhythm with the rotating crankshaft.</p>
<p>Some of the young ladies in our student ward didn’t believe Sheila was really engaged because we decided together that a diamond engagement ring would create unnecessary debt and would not be prudent. We settled on matching gold wedding bands instead. All together, we spent two or three hundred dollars for the whole affair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I share this with you to point out that you don’t need a lot of resources to find your wife and begin your life together. You only need to follow your heart and move forward with a lot of love and faith. I assure you that your Heavenly Father will help you provide all that is required. He will provide every needful thing for those that love and obey Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Strengthening Spiritual Communication</strong></span></p>
<p>This brings me to my concluding remarks about developing strong skills in communicating with God through prayer.</p>
<p>There are many in this audience who are away from home for the first time. At home, you were surrounded and supported by your family and friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now it is different. You are here among strangers without your former support group, if you haven’t already noticed. I suspect your prayers to God may have become a little more frequent and much more sincere since your arrival, especially during midterm and final exam week. Am I right? This is to be expected.</p>
<p>Your time at BYU–Hawaii presents you with an amazing opportunity to come to know your Heavenly Father and to strengthen your relationship with the Savior Jesus Christ better than at any other time in your life so far. Use this time to draw close to God through prayer. To do this effectively, you may find it helpful to develop your own personal routine or template that will help you cultivate and exercise this powerful gift.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want you to know that God hears and answers your prayers today just like he did in the times of the apostle James wherein he said, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">James 1:5</a>).</p>
<p>I have experienced the truth of this statement many times throughout my life. There is no doubt in my mind. I know it to be true.</p>
<p>Second, there are certain steps or requirements you need to follow to receive answers to your prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7-8?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>The message in these verses is repeated several times in scripture. Even though God already knows our needs, it is important we first recognize our needs and take proactive steps to satisfy them even it results in nothing more than seeking His blessing through prayer. As one thinks about this proclamation more deeply, one realizes how beautifully it ties into the principle of agency and law of obedience.</p>
<p>Third, there is a basic format that is followed in our religion when praying in public and in private. We begin by addressing our prayers to our creator, God the Father. Next, we acknowledge his hand in our lives and give thanks to Him for the many blessings we receive daily. After our expressions of gratitude, we humbly seek His guidance and blessing in our life. We close our prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. It is regarding this last step I wish to offer a few words of counsel. The first few steps of prayer are quite intuitive. However, the importance of and purpose for the last step may not be well understood by young Latter-day Saints. One of the reasons we always close our prayers in the name of Jesus Christ is because God the Father has commanded it.</p>
<p>“And again, I say unto you, all things must be done in the name of Christ, whatsoever you do in the Spirit” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">D&amp;C 46:31</a>).</p>
<p>Why has God commanded us to do this? Because it is by and through the Atonement of Jesus Christ that our lives have been redeemed from the Fall. It is through the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our advocate before the judgment bar of God, that we may be admitted into the kingdoms of heaven and into the presence of the Father. It is by and through Jesus Christ that all things were and are created and through whom all blessings flow. Simply stated, God wants us to remember these facts each and every time we approach Him in prayer. In so doing, we show respect for both the Father and the Son as we glorify their names.</p>
<p>However, many people in bearing their testimony and in offering their public prayers have fallen into the habit of rushing through the closing of their testimony or prayer in such a hurried fashion that it becomes indiscernible what they are saying. Unintentionally I am sure, it may appear they are treating these very important words as an afterthought or an accessory that is required by protocol but lacking in purpose and meaning. In reality, we all know this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would all do well at the conclusion of our testimonies and our prayers to pause to clearly and deliberately acknowledge the essential role of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ before uttering the word “amen.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, we applaud you for all that you are accomplishing here at this institution. As you continue your studies, we challenge you to expand and improve your communication skills. It will pay big dividends to you in the near future.</p>
<p>In a social setting, we encourage you to step outside your comfort zone and make the extra effort to get to know and love your fellow students better than you do today. The opportunity of making friends in college may never occur again. Some of your college friendships will last a lifetime, especially if one of them ends up being your eternal companion.</p>
<p>While you are here, please use this time away from home to build and strengthen a personal relationship with your Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ through earnest and faithful prayer.</p>
<p>We wish you the very best of success while here at BYU–Hawaii. Do not be afraid. Do not fear the unknown future. Go forth with faith. God will provide the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>May 6, 2014<br />Eric Workman<br />Executive Vice President of Marketing and Development, The Polynesian Cultural Center<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, aloha!</p>
<p>I have pondered and prayed diligently to know what to say to you today. What can I possibly offer you—the elite forces of heaven reserved for these last days here training to become leaders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are surrounded by bright faculty and staff who not only know well their fields but also seek to teach you truth by the Spirit of Truth. What can I offer you that they do not already?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are surrounded by senior missionaries—men and women with a wealth of experience to offer you. They love you and stand ready to help you in any way. Most of you are here without your families, and they are without their children and, perhaps more importantly, their grandchildren. It’s an inspired match. What wisdom can I offer you that they do not already?</p>
<p>Well as I have prayed earnestly to know what to say to you today, it has become clear to me exactly what my message should be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to share with you my absolute, total and complete conviction that your Father in Heaven will guide you if you want to be guided!</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you already know this to be true—for you, I speak today as another witness.</p>
<p>For those who are not quite as convinced or may not be feeling it at this moment, I say again, <strong>your Father in Heaven WILL guide you if you want to be guided!</strong></p>
<p>I am not sure I know why this is or really even how this could be, but it IS true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would the creator of worlds without number, the Father of the King of all Kings, the One to whom billions pray be at all concerned about me or you individually? My understanding of why is incomplete, but I do know He is our Father and that He loves us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know how He can even hear us all talking to Him at the same time. I can’t understand when just two of my children talk to me at the same time. What must billions be like? Does He use angels who return and report? How exactly is the Spirit involved? I don’t know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just 200 years ago, my cell phone would have been utterly incomprehensible and considered some sort of dark magic. I am perfectly willing to believe there are methods beyond my current comprehension, but the method is almost irrelevant to me because the outcome is very real. When I pick up that metaphorical phone to heaven, there is someone on the other end of the line, someone who I am getting to know better. Someone who quite often sends me packages when I ask for them. What is in those packages may not always be what I asked for, but I know they are always what I need.</p>
<p>I know you students are facing many forked roads these days.</p>
<p>What should you study? Should you serve a mission, and if so, when? Who will you marry? Will you be “all in” the Gospel or just partially? Will you avoid or devour things that destroy your body, mind, and soul?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many decisions to make. So many roads to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need divine guidance and you WILL get it, if you want it.</p>
<p>Divine guidance comes in many ways. I want to discuss just a few of those today:&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there are times we get exactly what we pray for.</p>
<p>Second, we already have the guidance we need; we just need to accept it.</p>
<p>Third, we get guidance we did not ask for—course-correcting guidance.</p>
<p>I hope you will not mind if I share with you a few personal experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Sometimes we get exactly what we pray for.</strong></p>
<p>On the first day I entered the mission field in Akron Ohio, the mission president made it clear to my eager new senior companion that he was to get me out tracting, knocking on doors, before the end of the day. I assumed it was because tracting was such a horrible thing, they wanted to get the initial shock over with quickly. In that mission, only half the missionaries that came out were able to baptize even one person during their entire two years of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a long drive to our area, my companion informed me that we had only 20 minutes before our dinner appointment with a member family, so we could only knock on a few doors. I prayed in the car with my companion to be directed to someone who wanted to hear the Gospel. Then we got out and started walking. We walked to the end of the street, passing several houses that just did not seem right to my companion. He said he felt impressed to turn left at the corner. We walked up to the first or second house on the left. It was a weathered, old, turn-of-the-century home. We knocked. No answer. We knocked again and waited. Finally, a tiny lady who looked to be in her 80s slowly opened the door and greeted us through the screen. We told her we represented Jesus Christ, and she readily welcomed us in. We talked for some time. We were late for our dinner appointment, but Winifred Schaefer was baptized about three weeks later.</p>
<p>The first door of the first street on the first day of my mission. Our prayer had been answered. Exactly what I had ordered. And the package came with a message: “I am here. I hear you. I will guide you if you will be led, and it may not be the best way to find people, but it is a way YOU will be directed to people.” &nbsp; And I was, to many people over the next two years.</p>
<p>Moses prayed for deliverance for his people and told them that the Lord would fight for them. Plagues descended, the Red Sea was divided, and Pharaoh’s army decimated. &nbsp;I would say his prayer was answered.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/9.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Alma 9:26</a>, we learn that the Son of God is quick to hear the cries of His people and to answer their prayers. I have found this to be true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversely, in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 101:7</a>, we learn “God is also slow to answer the prayers of those who are slow to hearken to him.” So be quick to hearken, desire to listen, and do what He asks above all else, and you can be sure to have your prayers answered, but those answers may not come as you expect.</p>
<p><strong>2. At times we have already received the answers we need, we just need to accept them.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Like packages we received months or years before, we opened them and left them sitting in the corner because we did not have use for the contents at the time.</p>
<p>From Nephi, we learned that we should “feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">2 Nephi 32:3</a>). The words of Christ are found in scripture, but they also often come through the lips and pens of His modern prophets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before serving a mission, I worked for Domino’s Pizza in California. It was a young, fast-moving company back in the early growth days of the chain. The owner of our particular franchise, Steve, was only 27 and already a multi-millionaire from his five new stores. Though the youngest on staff, I moved up in management quickly. To most of the other managers I was an odd ball—“no smoking, no drinking or no drugs, and he refuses to work on Sundays—a real stick in the mud.” But Steve seemed to see the value of leaving his stores in the hands of someone with such values.</p>
<p>He tried to convince me not to leave to serve a mission, but of course, I was not swayed. The more difficult decision was what to do when I returned after the mission. My family had moved back to Laie while I was gone. I stopped off in California on the way to Hawaii to give my homecoming talk and thank those that supported me. While there, I visited Steve. He offered me a job immediately and promised a store manager position and large bonus within a year. He also promised to help me get my own territory and franchise in three years if I would stay. I could do what he had done and have what he had. With the offer came the entrepreneur’s lecture: “You don’t need a college education to be successful and make a lot of money.” He was living proof. He handed me the keys to his Porche 928S with Blaupunkt stereo and told me to take it for a drive to think things over. And if I started soon, he would also throw in the car. He’d get a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the drive—a very fast drive—lots of country roads in that area. When I brought him back his keys, I told him I needed to see my family first, and I would call him from Hawaii with a decision by the end of the week. He accepted the delay but once again was perplexed by my peculiar ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trip home and the next few days in Hawaii were long and torturous. Having grown up on welfare much of my childhood, I was determined to be financially successful, and I wanted to eventually have my own business, so why not now? Why wait?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the corner of my mind sat the answer to my prayers that I had received long before. I heard the words of the prophets urging me to “get as much education as possible.” I knew this was what I needed to do, but I fought it.</p>
<p>I will always remember the horrible bus ride to Kaneohe at the end of that week. I had procrastinated making the decision as long as possible. I received no confirmation or guidance to my pleading prayers, only the ringing in my ears of the prophets’ counsel: “Get all the education you can.” I got off the bus at Windward Mall and entered a telephone booth on the street (yes, this was before the days of cell phones). Steve answered the phone, and I told him I would not be returning. I would be attending BYU–Hawaii. I could hear the disgust in his voice. I hung up because I did not want to agonize any longer. I felt I had made the right choice, but it was not what I wanted at that moment.</p>
<p>At that time, I had no comprehension of how a liberal arts education would open my understanding, how a business degree or two would allow me to travel all around the globe and work with many of the largest, most influential companies in the world.</p>
<p>And more importantly, at that time, I had no idea that I had already met, a few days prior, at the Yoshimura Shop at PCC, the shave ice girl of my dreams—the wonderful woman that would, in two years, become my wife and in time the mother of our seven children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shudder to think how things would have been different if I had not heeded the words of the prophets and the answer to my prayers, received long before I ever asked.</p>
<p>This brings me to my last point.</p>
<p><strong>3. We get guidance we did not ask for—course-correcting guidance.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, we get divine guidance we did not even know we needed. It’s my opinion that this type of guidance most often comes only when you are well off a path you need to be on, and the divine course correction that comes is proportional to the severity of the change in direction needed. This is what Joseph Smith learned in his first uttered prayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In no way was that young boy expecting the guidance he received. The thought that all other churches “were wrong” had not entered his heart, but the answer he received and the way it was delivered were necessary to change the course of his life and ours.</p>
<p>My personal example is much less dramatic but perhaps still relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was beginning my second year here at BYU–Hawaii, and I was fortunate enough to have a job with ASBYU. One day, I entered the Aloha Center and was walking to my office. A ways off, I saw this very cute girl reading on one of the couches outside the offices. Uncharacteristic for me, I instantly recalled having met her just once, about a year before, at the Yoshimura Store at PCC. She was a friend of my sister and was dating someone, etc. As I was about to open the door of the office, I heard a voice in my mind say, “Go talk with that girl.” I brushed it off, telling myself I had too much to do to be taking time for that stuff right now—studying, important ASBYU things. So I unlocked the door and entered the ASBYU offices. Once inside, I again heard a voice say, “Go talk with her.” Again I brushed it off. I was busy. I unlocked my inner office door and started to sit down when I heard the voice in my mind again tell me to go out now and talk with her. And this time, there was also a foreboding feeling that this was the third and final time I would hear that guidance, and it would be my great loss if I did not do as directed. So I reluctantly left the office and went to speak with this girl. Having no idea what I was going to say, I simply started by reminding her that we had met long ago. Fortunately, she remembered the occasion. and it had been a positive experience! I probed to learn about her dating status and fortunately found she was free. I was struck by her beauty, quick wit, intelligence, and, well, pretty much everything about her. We found ways to run into each other and eventually be together nearly every day after for the next eight months.</p>
<p>Even so, eight months later, I found myself praying earnestly for an answer to my prayers: “Should I marry Anne?” Up to the night before our wedding, I was in panic. I had NOT yet receive the answer I was looking for to confirm that it was the right thing to do. Strangely, the promptings I experienced that brought us together had been pushed aside in my mind. I wanted more, but I was already on the right course. I did not need further guidance to get on the right track. Fortunately, we were married as planned, and I have never, not one single moment since, regretted that decision—it is the single best decision I have ever made.</p>
<p>I have come to understand how much our Father in Heaven values our agency—perhaps above all else. I do not know completely why it is of such critical importance to Him, but obviously it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you remember nothing else from what I have said today and assuming you are living so as to be able to hear the still small promptings of the Spirit, I hope you remember this one principle:</p>
<p>In the absence of divine guidance, keep moving forward with faith and the confidence that you will receive the guidance you need when you need it.</p>
<p>You are supposed to do many things of your own free will (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">D&amp;C 58:27</a>), but your Father in Heaven will not let you get too far off course without giving you the gentle course-correcting guidance you need. You must be willing to accept it when it does come, but it will come.</p>
<p>I have shared with you just a few of the many experiences I have had. I could have shared with you experiences from my corporate career, church service, or family, but I felt impressed to share with you these particular experiences—likely because of who you are and where we are. Again, these are just a few of the answers to prayer and guidance I have received. Each is like a brush stoke of a priceless painting.</p>
<p>At the Muse Dorsey in Paris, France, Anne and I once saw, up close, a painting that has stuck with me. It was a piece entitled Poppies by Claude Monet (arguably the father of French Impressionism), which he painted in 1873. The painting was made up of thousands of tiny little brush strokes—some just blobs of paint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No single stroke, on its own, was of much significance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No small group of strokes added up to much either, but as you moved out&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could see that all those small strokes were integral parts of one masterpiece—one of the most recognized pieces of art in the world by one of the world’s greatest artists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it is with our lives. All the little answers to prayers we receive may not appear to be much. Many could even be explained away as coincidence, but when you step back, you can see in your life the undeniable work of the Master Artist. And when you become a parent or serve in the Church or elsewhere, you also begin to see the brushstrokes in others’ lives, all blending together in one miraculous masterwork.</p>
<p>You WILL receive the divine guidance you need.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it will come exactly as you expect.</p>
<p>At other times, you will realize that you have already received the guidance you need, if you will just accept it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you may even receive course-correcting guidance you didn’t know you needed.</p>
<p>And for those times when you feel an absence of guidance, keep moving forward with faith and the confidence that your Father in Heaven hears you, knows you, loves you, and will guide you when you really need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are HIS masterwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my firm and absolute conviction.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, our advocate and exemplar in all these things, amen.</p>

<p>April 29, 2014<br />Keith B. McMullin<br />President &amp; CEO of Deseret Management Corporation<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, often says, “Young men speak of the future because they have no past; old men speak of the past because they have no future.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It is easy to see where you and I fit in this observation. Some people might call me old, and my purpose today is to visit with you about your future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s consider first what it means to be in different generations. A generation is a body of individuals born within a 20 to 30 year period of time. Generational characteristics may include having similar ideas, facing common challenges, or displaying certain attitudes. Just so you know, you are often referred to as “Generation Y” or the “Millennial Generation,” while Sister McMullin and I are part of the so-called “Best Generation,” those growing up immediately following World War II.</p>
<p>A generational comparison was recently done to show how attitudes are changing about community and family, about making and spending money. The report said that fame and fortune are currently replacing faith and family as the core of the American Dream. Two-thirds of Americans in the study said traditional notions of the ideal life—community, religion, faith, and middle class values—have shifted. Getting married, attending Church, and paying off mortgages best fit <strong>in the past</strong>, whereas the ability to buy things, achieve recognition or status, and equality best fit <strong>in the present</strong>.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our recent General Conference, prophets, seers, and revelators spoke about generational changes with emphasis on the younger generations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From President Thomas S. Monson: </strong>“We live in a world where moral values have, in great measure, been tossed aside, where sin is flagrantly on display, and where temptations to stray from the strait and narrow path surround us. … Have the courage to defy the consensus, the courage to stand for principle. Courage, not compromise, brings the smile of God’s approval. Courage becomes a living and an attractive virtue when it is regarded … as the determination to live decently.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>President Monson also urged, “May we begin now, this very day, to express love to all of God’s children, whether they be our family members, our friends, mere acquaintances, or total strangers. As we arise each morning, let us determine to respond with love and kindness to whatever might come our way.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>From Elder Jeffrey R. Holland:</strong> “<span style="font-size: xx-small;">You may wonder if it is worth it to take&nbsp;</span>a courageous moral stand. … Yes, it is worth it, because the alternative is to have our “houses” left unto us “desolate”—desolate individuals, desolate families, desolate neighborhoods, and desolate nations.&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5">5</a>&nbsp;</sup>… Be strong. Live the gospel faithfully even if others around you don’t live it at all. Defend your beliefs with courtesy and with compassion, but defend them. … In courageously pursuing such a course, you will forge unshakable faith, you will find safety against ill winds that blow … and you will feel the rock-like strength of our Redeemer.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>From Elder Neil L. Andersen: </strong>“My young friends, the world will not glide calmly toward the Second Coming of the Savior. … These are your days — to … build more firmly your foundation upon the rock of your Redeemer. Treasure more completely His incomparable life and teachings. Follow more diligently His example and His commandments. Embrace more deeply His love, His mercy and grace, and the powerful gifts of His Atonement. As you do … you will rejoice that God has placed you here to be a part of the final preparations for Christ’s glorious return.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul outlined to a younger disciple of his day the difficult challenges now confronting you. We’ll mention only a few of them, but you will want to read the entire list, for they are signposts of this age: “In the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, ... and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. ...But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Now the “old man” in me is going to speak with you about <em>humility</em>. It is an endangered virtue. It is, however, essential to future happiness and real success. So give an old man his due; this is grandpa speaking, so listen up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was 19 years of age, I received this inspired direction: “Life is a serious matter. The more humble you are the greater your knowledge, the greater the virtues.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> Over more than a half century since receiving that direction, I have learned that humility in nations and in people waxes and wanes. For me personally, it is strongest when I recognize how much I yet have to overcome; it is weakest when I think I have finally arrived. The same is true with nations. All progress in spiritual things is conditioned upon attaining and maintaining humility.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>In all generations, humility is fundamental to peace and personal well-being. The Lord said: “And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that <em>they may be humble</em>; and my grace is sufficient for all men<em> that humble themselves before me</em>; for if they <em>humble themselves before me</em>, and<em> have faith in me</em>, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.”<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Humility that blesses and saves occurs as we subordinate our will to the will of God. Humility is the embodiment of contrition, love, gratitude, and faith. It cannot be feigned nor manufactured. It is what we are as we recognize our sins and foibles and steadfastly walk the strait and narrow path in overcoming them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the grandest guides in scripture for charting a successful life is this: “<em>Be thou humble</em>; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> This promise is especially pertinent as you form patterns of thinking, perceiving, and speaking in preparation for your futures. These patterns emerge daily in your lives. Over time, they become habits that will serve you well or bring you unhappiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldly ways can creep into our patterns of thought, expression, and behavior and squelch humility. It is why Paul counseled, “Flee … youthful lusts.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> The following are worldly ways I counsel you to avoid.</p>
<p><em><strong>Beware of boasting</strong></em><strong><em>.</em></strong> It is commonplace and it is destructive. Bragging has become an art form. Documenting one’s accomplishments, laying claim to unique abilities, and seeking personal acclaim and recognition are everywhere displayed. Résumés, portfolios, and job applications call for a recitation of abilities, experiences, and interests, but our personal expressions and patterns of life needn’t be this way. Habits such as name dropping, striving to be noticed, projecting ourselves above others, putting others down, or interrupting and wrangling conversations all manifest arrogance, egotism, and pride. They stifle humility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should heed instead the counsel of King Benjamin: “[God] hath created you, and granted unto you your lives. … [H]e doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, <em>of what have ye to boast?</em>”<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Beware of acting smart. </em></strong>To be glib, to always have an opinion or appear to have an answer, is not spiritually healthy. Glib is the shortened version of a now obsolete word “glibbing,” meaning slippery. Remember, when you think of yourself or characterize a person as “smart,” you may be conveying the impression that others are not quite so fortunate. Such an atmosphere is not conducive to humility.</p>
<p>Abilities we have are gifts from God. Each of you has one or more of them. It is prideful and hurtful when bestowed gifts are touted, flaunted, or coveted. On the other hand, it is joyful to discover, nurture, and cultivate them for the quiet, unheralded benefit of others.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> And when appreciation is expressed or applause given, be grateful, remembering always who gave you the gift.</p>
<p>From Nephi we read, “O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish. <em>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</em>”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Beware of being driven.</strong></em> Overcommitment is a sin of the age. We seem to think we must do everything to amount to anything. To be anxiously engaged does not mean frantically racing about. Too much engagement stunts inspiration and humility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In contrast, the law of consecration is balanced, prioritized, and peaceful. It requires total devotion and work, but the principle of consecration rests on a foundation of humility and love. It enables a person to prioritize life’s requirements in divinely appointed ways. It helps us slow down, contemplate, do less of some things, and accomplish essential things</p>
<p><em><strong>Beware of fear and contention.</strong></em> Neither the spirit of fear nor the spirit of contention is of God.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> They do, however, feed on each other. In our home hangs this expression: “When you’re confident of what you are saying, you don’t have to yell.” Confidence springs from pure motives and guileless intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Destroyer twists pangs of conscience into feelings of fear and worthlessness. He transforms discussions into contests of opinion. Such feelings and discourse thwart humility.</p>
<p>“Foolish and unlearned questions avoid,” wrote Paul “knowing that they do gender strifes.”<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> When you feel afraid, gloomy, or argumentative, recognize that these feelings do not come from Heavenly Father. Check yourself. Pray. Seek help from family, Church leaders, and others you trust. There is “a more excellent way.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Beware of lusts</em></strong>. Lusts are the sinful and impure desires to which fallen man is heir.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> They are all about us. Said John, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. … For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: <em>but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</em>”<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Enough about things that encumber or squelch humility. What is the well-spring of humility; the source to which each of us can turn and discover it for ourselves?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early 12th century, the cleric Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, “a man of intense … faith,” penned the following words:</p>
<p><em>Jesus, the very thought of thee<br />With sweetness fills my breast;<br />But sweeter far thy face to see<br />And in thy presence rest.</em></p>
<p><em>Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, <br />Nor can the mem’ry find<br />A sweeter sound than thy blest name,<br />O Savior of mankind!</em></p>
<p><em>O hope of ev’ry contrite heart, <br />O joy of all the meek,<br />To those who fall, how kind thou art!<br />How good to those who seek!</em><sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>These lines speak of hope and joy and peace. They were written in a time when much of the world lay blanketed in ignorance, impoverishment, and despair. These words capture the humility that accompanies the testimony of Jesus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal witness by the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is your Savior is the well-spring of humility. Nurtured through repentance, forgiveness, and righteous living, this testimony of Jesus becomes the guiding force in the way one speaks, behaves, and interacts with others. Furthermore, it is available to us all, for “God is no respecter of persons.”<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Acquiring a testimony of Jesus Christ, however, does not come without effort. One must <em>learn about Him, listen to Him, and come unto Him</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learn About Him&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Savior invites us, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; <em>for I am meek and lowly in heart</em>: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”<sup><a href="#24">24&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Listen To Him&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Our Lord encourages us, “Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.”<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> The holy scriptures and living oracles bring us His words, the Holy Spirit brings us His voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Come Unto Him&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Concurrent with learning and listening, one must come unto Him. The person who does what Jesus says comes to Him. The Savior beckons, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup> John the Beloved counseled, “He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.”<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>President David O. McKay observed, “The highest of all ideals are the teachings and particularly the life of Jesus of Nazareth, and that man is most truly great who is most Christlike. What you sincerely in your heart think of Christ will determine what you are, will largely determine what your acts will be. No person can study this divine personality, can accept his teachings without becoming conscious of an uplifting and refining influence within himself.”<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course leads the contrite and penitent to humility, knowing the Lord gives us a correct perspective of who we are and what we can become. For example, His life did not begin in Bethlehem, and ours did not begin at birth. In the premortal world, He stood as the stalwart advocate of God’s eternal plan, and we stood with Him. In the great War in Heaven, it was by the power of the Firstborn that Lucifer was cast out, and we helped champion that cause. Through Christ, “the worlds are and were created,” and we can therefore achieve our divine potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In mortality, He “continued from grace to grace, until he received a fullness,”<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> and so can we. Angels attended Him, the Holy Ghost descended upon Him, the woes of all mankind were carried by Him, death was overcome because of Him, and our sins can be forgiven through Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To gain an appreciation for the majesty of our Savior, listen to these insights from President J. Reuben Clark, a counselor in the First Presidency many years ago: “It was not a novice, not an amateur, not a Being making a first trial, that came down in the beginning, after the Great Council, with other Gods, and searched out and found the place where there was ‘space,’ and taking of the materials which they found in this ‘space’ they made this world. … We from this point where we stand or float, can see … light-years all around us. A light-year is the distance which light, traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles a second will travel in one year. …</p>
<p>“Where we are moving, how we are moving, how rapidly we go, we do not know. As you look into the heavens you do not see the heavens as they are today. You see them as they were the number of light-years ago when the light therefrom began to come from them to us. If it is a hundred million light-years away, it was a hundred million years ago.”</p>
<p>President Clark continued, “Astronomers now yield … that there may have been many, and probably were, many worlds like ours. … Our Lord is not a novice, he is not an amateur; he has been over this time and time and time again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And if you think of this galaxy of ours having within it from the beginning perhaps until now, one million worlds, and multiply that by the number of…galaxies…you will then get some view of who [Jesus Christ] is. …</p>
<p>“Miracles prove he had control of the elements. … He calmed the storm. …</p>
<p>“Jesus had control of the animal kingdom. … At his word they cast their net and it was filled with fish. …</p>
<p>“The vegetable kingdom came under his dominion, also, for he cursed the barren fig tree as he went by. …</p>
<p>“That is the Man we worship. That is the Man who gave us the law that will enable us to fulfill our destiny declared from the very beginning.”<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>The Living Christ was sent by God “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup> Hence, He came to the Prophet Joseph Smith, restored the priesthood, reestablished His Church, and again proclaimed the plan of redemption. Joseph saw Him, conversed with Him, and has left us this transcendent, poetic account of Him:</p>
<p><em>I beheld round the throne holy angels and hosts,<br />And sanctified beings from worlds that have been,<br />In holiness worshipping God and the Lamb,<br />For ever and ever. Amen and amen.</em></p>
<p><em>And now after all of the proofs made of him,<br />By witnesses truly, by whom he was known,<br />This is mine, last of all, that he lives; yea, he lives!<br />And sits at the right hand of God on his throne.</em></p>
<p><em>And I heard a great voice bearing record from heav’n,<br />He’s the Saviour and only begotten of God;<br />By him, of him, and through him, the worlds were all made,<br />Even all that [careen] in the heavens so broad.</em></p>
<p><em>Whose inhabitants, too, from the first to the last,<br />Are sav’d by the very same Saviour of ours;<br />And, of course, are begotten God’s daughters and sons<br />By the very same truths and the very same powers.</em><sup><a href="#32">32&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
<p>Jesus, the very thought of Thee fills the heart with contrition, love, gratitude, and faith, the hallmarks of humility. I thank God for my testimony of Jesus Christ and pray that yours will be forever strong and unshakeable. He is the well-spring of humility. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I have a five-year old grandson named Carson. A couple of years ago, when he was about three, his sister came into the house with a bag of fruit snacks. When her mother asked where she had gotten the snacks, she reported that Carson had given them to her. On further investigation, his mother discovered he had been sharing these fruit snacks with several of the neighbors. His mother called him in and questioned him about where he had obtained the snacks since they did not have any. Carson replied that he was getting them out of the neighbor’s garage. His now concerned mother said, “Carson, you can’t go in the neighbor’s garage and take things that don’t belong to you.” Carson replied, “But I just love ‘em.” Sometimes, we are tempted to be dishonest because we want something that is not ours just because “we just love 'em.”</p>
<p>I want to talk with you today about being honest. The <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">13th Article of Faith</a> states, “We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul – We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”</p>
<p>According to the dictionary, honesty is the quality or fact of being honest; upright , fair, truthful, free from deceit or fraud, honorable in principles, intentions, and actions; gained or obtained fairly, moral, trustworthy, good, decent, and righteousness.</p>
<p>Being dishonest is defined as deceit, fraud, lying, untruthful, corruption, and cheating.</p>
<p>There are many ways to be dishonest. Today, I will talk just about two: lying and stealing.</p>
<p>In the Ten Commandments, these two are specifically mentioned:</p>
<p>• Thou shalt not steal.</p>
<p>• Thou shalt not bear false witness against your neighbor.</p>
<p>Let me start by talking about stealing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">D&amp;C 42:20</a> reads, "Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and will not repent shall be cast out." This command indicates the unrepentant thief should be excommunicated, and therefore, his covenants are removed. Losing the saving ordinances is a high price to pay for theft. Many times, we think of stealing as a crime that may not hurt anyone, but that is not true.</p>
<p>Elder Marvin J. Ashton stated, “A person is poor when he thinks honesty is a policy instead of a proper way of life. … An honest conscience is worth more than it costs. Greatness is truly measured by honest self-appraisal. ‘What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?’ (Mark 8:36). How many times have you heard the declaration that it is greater to be trusted than to be loved? Let me remind you that, regardless of the number of times, you haven't heard it enough. One of my greatest pleadings with the Lord on a daily basis is for Him to help me turn the hearts of the dishonest to repentance. Without honesty, there is no foundation upon which to build. How can a person be helped when he insists on living the lie? Lying and living the lie keep us poor."</p>
<p>How prevalent is the problem of dishonesty. In just one area – shoplifting - the cost to American retailers was $40 billion in 2007, according to a study by Retail Systems Research.</p>
<p>A 2006 article stated, “Shoplifting has become one of the most prevalent crimes in the U.S., averaging about 550,000 incidents per day. … Current estimates are as high as 1 in 11 Americans who shoplift in our nation today.”</p>
<p>On some products, this means that the consumer pays 30, 40, or even 50% more to cover the losses from just shoplifting. Does that sound to you like a sin that does not have a cost associated with it?</p>
<p>When I was in kindergarten, we walked from the outskirts of town to the downtown elementary school. One day on the way home from school, I stopped in Hayward’s Market. As I wandered around, I spied some safety pins, and thinking that my mom could use those, I put a package in my pocket and walked home. When my mother arrived home from work, I presented her with my present. She asked where I had obtained such a nice gift. I told her from the market. "How did you pay for them?" she asked. I told her I did not pay; I just took them. Well, the next thing that happened was a trip to the market. We climbed in the car and headed to Hayward’s Market. Mr. Hayward had a loft, so he could see out onto the market’s floor. Climbing those stairs was scary. Each stair seemed higher than the last one. Having to explain my actions and apologize to an old man who at that moment looked more like Scrooge than Santa Claus made it worse. He and my mother must have had a discussion before we got there because he really lectured me on being honest and what the results were of being dishonest. I had not stolen the pins for me. I am not sure that I even thought I was stealing at the time, but I did after getting a lecture from both my mother and Mr. Hayward. I learned a wonderful lesson from them. When I reflect back on the experience, I do so with appreciation for both of them. It would have been easier for Mr. Hayward to have not wasted his time on a six- year old taking such a small thing, but he must have understood he was teaching an eternal principal, and he changed my life for the better.</p>
<p>Years later, when my daughter Hannah was about four, she picked up some crayons from the store. We did not notice that she had them until we were home. Hoping for the same kind of help in teaching the principal of honesty, my wife took her to see the manager of that store. The manager was a nice lady. She could see that Hannah was quite upset, so she said something like, “It is okay, sweetheart. I know you did not mean to do it.” It did not have the same effect as my meeting with Mr. Hayward, so we needed to be Mr. Hayward ourselves, so she could learn the lesson. She did, and she in turn had to teach it to her son Carson years later when he pilfered the fruit snacks. This shows to me how important it is for parents and others to teach correct principles. Four generations here were involved in teaching the lessons of honesty. You wonder what would have happened if my mother had done nothing?</p>
<p>We believe in being honest. Now what of lying?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:18</a>, we read, “And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil."</p>
<p>Satan was and is the father of all lies.</p>
<p>The Lord said to Moses, "Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down; And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3-4?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Moses 4:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>Satan began his war on this earth against the Father by lying to Eve. “Thou shalt not die,” he said, but that is exactly what happened to her. Satan will lie to you over and over again, telling you that you will not die if you sin, that what you’re doing is not that bad, that others are doing it, and he will try to get you to lie to help his cause. Think about Korihor in The Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>“But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.53?lang=eng#52" target="_blank">Alma 30:53</a>.)</p>
<p>Satan tempted Korihor with popularity and power. All he had to do was lie, and he kept lying until he believed his own lies. He then was cursed by Alma, and a few verses later, we find his fate. He was trodden upon and killed. I am not sure how that happened but it does not sound good. In verse 60, we read, “And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.60?lang=eng#59" target="_blank">Alma 30:60</a>).</p>
<p>Satan has no power to support his children eternally, despite what he or his servants say. In matters of eternity, Satan is impotent to decide. You and I have agency to decide. Whose side will you be on?</p>
<p>In contrast to Satan, the father of lies, Moses, David, Isaiah, Enos, and the Brother of Jared all call the Savior “the God of Truth.” Enos and the Brother of Jared also remind us that God cannot lie.</p>
<p>Christ promises to sustain, build, and uplift us as we follow Him, and He does have the power to do that eternally. As Elder Jeffery R. Holland taught the stake presidencies and bishops recently here in Hawaii, we know who will win this war between Lucifer and Christ. Christ will win. Why would you choose up front to join a team you knew was going to lose, he asked us. Satan will lose. We must not unite with him.</p>
<p>In today’s media, we see the popular groups of society in the world apparently uniting with Satan in committing sins of theft, lying, and worse. Sports figures, actors, and politicians all are breaking almost at will the basic commandments. This is so common today that maybe we think the scripture in Psalms was written for our day: "Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/120.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Psalms 120:2</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in 1987, two major weekly magazines – <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> and <em>Time </em>– had covers that read, "Lying in America" (<em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, 23. Feb. 1987) and "What Ever Happened to Ethics?" (<em>Time</em>, 25 May 1987).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since that time, things have not improved. In 1998, Jeff Benedict and Don Yeager wrote a book called Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL. Our heroes are not very heroic when it comes to virtue and truth. I am not sure that some of them could even pretend to believe in the principles of the 13th Article of Faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Marvin J. Ashton said, “We live in a world of law. We may be able to avoid or skirt laws of the land, but the laws of heaven have an irrevocable effect on us today, tomorrow, and forever.”</p>
<p>He continues, “May our Heavenly Father help us to have the courage to acknowledge and cast aside the living of a lie or the perpetuation of lies. Honesty is more than a policy. It is a happy way of life as we deal with our fellowmen, and particularly as we live with ourselves.” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm?lang=eng" target="_blank">This Is No Harm</a>," General Conference, April 1982.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of lying, I found a few quotes which teach some wonderful truths.</p>
<p>"Sin," said Oliver Wendell Holmes, "has many tools, but a lie is the handle which fits them all" (from “The Chambered Nautilus”).</p>
<p>"Nothing else," said President J. Reuben Clark, "is quite so despicable or cowardly as a lie, and it is an added iniquity to befoul another with an untruth" (<em>South African Mission Bulletin</em>, 19 Jan. 1971).</p>
<p>"Wo unto the liar," said Jacob, the brother of Nephi, "for he shall be thrust down to hell" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.34?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:34</a>). This may be the first scripture I ever memorized. I think I did it more to irritate my friends as I would quote it anytime I thought they needed teasing. But while it is a simple scripture, it carries a powerful warning.</p>
<p>"Anyone who doesn't take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either."– Albert Einstein</p>
<p>"A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” – Winston Churchill</p>
<p>This is particularly true today with the internet.</p>
<p>"If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything." – Mark Twain</p>
<p>That is one of my personal favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Half a truth is often a great lie." – Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>I hope these quotes on lying have been thought provoking and inspiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President James E. Faust reminded us that "Honesty is a principle, and we have our moral agency to determine how we will apply this principle. We have the agency to make choices, but ultimately we will be accountable for each choice we make. We may deceive others, but there is One we will never deceive. From The Book of Mormon we learn, 'The keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name' (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.41?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:41</a>)" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1996/10/honesty-a-moral-compass?lang=eng#3-" target="_blank">Honesty—A Moral Compass</a>," General Conference, Oct. 1996.)</p>
<p>Now let’s discuss a story in the book of Acts in the New Testament. Like a few others in the scriptures, this one seems a little harsh, but it teaches the seriousness of lying. I think many of the stories in the scriptures are models or patterns, so we can liken them to ourselves. This story may be more about the spiritual consequences of lying than the temporal ones. In the scripture, apparently the ancient church was practicing a form of consecration. The members were to unite their belongings holding nothing back. With that background, here is the story as found in the fifth chapter of Acts. I will tell it rather than read it, so I can hopefully liken it to us.</p>
<p>A man and his wife, Ananias and Sapphira by name, joined the Church. As I mentioned, the Church was practicing a form of consecration. The members were bringing their donations to Peter who was then the head of the Church. Ananias presented his donation to Peter, but Peter knew by the Holy Ghost that Ananias was being dishonest in saying he had given all the money from the sale of his property. Peter then made a couple of profound statements. He said basically, Ananias, you owned the property you sold; you had the proceeds from it. No one forced you to give the proceeds to the Church and pretend to join us in good faith, but in coming here and saying that you are giving all the proceeds from the property you sold is not true, and you have lied to God. How had he lied to God? He lied to his church leader, his prophet. When Ananias found his lie was revealed, he died. It is a good thing for us that we don’t die when we lie. Some might not live too long. Now that is not the end of the story. When Ananias dies, men come and take him out and bury him. Apparently, it was not the custom to wait for relatives to arrive from Samoa. He was buried right away. Later, his wife comes to Peter. She did not know what happened to her husband. Peter interviewed her. Basically, his question was like the temple recommend question that reads, “Are you honest in your dealings with your fellow men?” He said to Sapphira, I understood you sold your property for such and such a price. Is that right? Well, she had worked out with her husband what their story would be, so she said yes. Peter rebuked her and said, Why are you lying like your husband did? He has died and is buried and now you will be buried next to him. She then died.</p>
<p>As I said, this is a harsh story, but as I have spent more time in the scriptures, I think that the stories and the way they are written are meant to give us patterns and teach higher principles. Here, for example, we could just say that these two were smitten for lying, which would be true. However, how does that relate to us? I have no knowledge of a single person being smitten when they declared they were full tithe payers when they were not. At least not physically. I think these scriptures may be talking to us about our spiritual life. I am sure Ananias died and was buried, but to us, this scripture may be saying that if you lie to your leaders about tithing or other matters, you are creating spiritual suicide. It is better to be truthful and live eternally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, remembering the story and thinking that it is spiritual more than physical, what is the fate of liars spiritually? We can read that in several places but here are two. First, let’s read in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/21.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Revelation 21:8</a>.</p>
<p>“But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”</p>
<p>Do you notice that liars are grouped with murderers and those that commit other very serious crimes? We may not want to think of lying as being that serious, but obviously the Lord does.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.102-106?lang=eng#101" target="_blank">D&amp;C 76:102-106</a>, we learn of those in the Telestial kingdom.</p>
<p>“Last of all, these all are they who will not be gathered with the saints, to be caught up unto the church of the Firstborn, and received into the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“These are they who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.</p>
<p>“These are they who suffer the wrath of God on earth.</p>
<p>“These are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p>“These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fullness of times, when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work.”</p>
<p>Again notice that the fate of liars is not good. Their eternal associates are not the kind of people most of us want to be with now and surely not forever. Now, let me summarize some of the points we have made by borrowing a list from President Marion G. Romney, which he made when speaking about lying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Satan is the father of lying and inaugurated the practice in this world when in the Garden of Eden he lied to Eve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. God cannot lie.</p>
<p>3. God hates lying.</p>
<p>4. Liars are classified with major transgressors.</p>
<p>5. All unrepentant liars "shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."</p>
<p>We are involved in a battle. The outcome is not merely the loss of the few years a person has in mortality but the infinite years one might have in immortality. The weapons of this war are truth and lies. Christ is the personification of truth and Satan the father of lies. Christ has died for us that we might live. Satan would have us live in such a way that we would die. We should choose our leader well. The outcome is sure, but the casualty list is still to be determined. Christ will triumph, and we will triumph as well and live eternally if we are true and faithful to Christ.</p>
<p>When I mentioned to my wife the subject I was speaking on, she remembered a talk given by then BYU president Dallin H. Oaks back in 1973. What made it impactful for her was that he gave specific examples of lying and stealing. I will attempt to update and consolidate from his list some of the items that I have encountered here at this university. There obviously could be many more.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest to buy something on credit when you do not have the money to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest to go to the doctor and have no intention of paying for his services or leave the country without paying the debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest for a student who can and should support himself in his education to spend his money on cars, TVs, sports, phones, iPods, etc. and then go to the bishop and ask the Church to pay his food and housing bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest for young people to lie on their financial aid applications and feel justified because they think others do it or because they do not want to work or wait for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest for a student to accept scholarships that encourage them to return to their home country when they have no intention of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest of a young man to seek an exemption for shaving, pleading skin disorder when he really just wants to break the dress and grooming standards&nbsp;</p>
<p>• It is dishonest of a student to sign the Honor Code, stating that they will abide by its principles and then willingly break them.</p>
<p>Elder Oaks uses three quotes that I especially like. Here they are:</p>
<p>President Nathan Eldon Tanner cautioned that "If a young man [and I would add woman] is dishonest in any way, he is on the way to destruction."</p>
<p>Karl G. Maeser taught that sooner or later everyone of us "must stand at the forks of the road, and choose between personal interests and some principle of right" (Alma P. Burton, <em>Karl G. Maeser</em>, Mormon Educator, 74).</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson observed, “He who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, 'til at length it becomes habitual. He tells lies without attending to it and truths without the world's believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all its good dispositions” (Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Peter Carr, 19 Aug. 1785, quoted in<em> Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations</em>, 13th ed., 373).&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Oaks then concluded, “A person who is only partially honest and only partially truthful is always having to make hard decisions about whether each new circumstance of life calls for honesty or deceit. How much better to commit oneself to the way of absolute honesty and truthfulness. A person with that commitment will waste no time or energy on deciding whether or when or the extent to which he will compromise with principle.” ("<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=571" target="_blank">Be Honest in All Behavior</a>," BYU Devotional, 13 Jan. 1973.)</p>
<p>One last quote. This one is from Brigham Young.</p>
<p>Brigham Young taught, “Can you mingle with the wicked and feel contented in their company? If you can you are on the road to destruction; you are not on the road to perfection. If you can deal, and trade, and visit, and ride, and be with the ungodly, and cannot see the difference between them and the righteous, if you are ever saved in any decent kingdom, it will be because you are totally ignorant. But if you can truthfully say, I love prayer, not swearing; I love truth, not lying; I love honesty, not dishonesty; I love God and His laws, you may be assured you are on the road to exaltation and eternal life. Let us sustain the kingdom of God; and if we do, we will sustain ourselves in truth and righteousness” (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 26.12, 220).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, I know that if you are honest, you will be happy. You must be truthful, particularly in your discussions with priesthood leaders. If you are honest, it will permit the Holy Ghost to guide you and lift you, but if you choose the way of the world, you will reap only unhappiness in the end. I pray you will be wise and truthfully say, “I believe in being honest.”&nbsp;</p>
