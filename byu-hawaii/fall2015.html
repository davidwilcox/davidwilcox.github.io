<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Legacy of Prayer</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-align: left;">Aloha, brothers and sisters. I’m so grateful Carolyn could be with me today. She is the epitome of all that is joyful and beautiful in my life. &nbsp;She and I have been rejoicing exceedingly ever since we learned of the appointment of President John Tanner to preside over this campus with his wife Susan. The Lord has prepared them well for this assignment. Carolyn and I love BYU Hawaii for a 1000 reasons, just one of which is that five of our seven children found their spouses here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>At President Wheelwright’s request, I have spent the last year writing, editing, and consolidating a volume of history with Dr. Alf Pratte that celebrates this campus and its life of 60 years. I have meditated long on many past events and thought deeply about the comments of alumni and others who submitted their narratives to be included in the book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Themes of Gratitude</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the most conspicuous themes in the book is that the University clearly came about by prophetic vision. There was no compelling logic or natural evolution to bring about the Church College of Hawaii, now BYU Hawaii. &nbsp;But the Lord God had planted in the heart of his prophet on earth, David O. McKay, to establish the school and to prophesy that the campus and the people educated here would wield a global influence for good and that millions would eventually be blessed by it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With this theme in mind, I would like to say again what I fervently believe that you, all of you, are part of that original vision; that just as the campus is here by prophetic destiny, so you are also here by divine appointment. For whatever reason you think you are here, Heavenly Father wants you here for his own reasons. This university is part of his grand plan for you, not just to help launch your career, or to find your eternal companion, although many of you will, but for your successful preparation, academically and spiritually, for a productive mortal life of service to all human kind, and for your eternal life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this sense, I believe as students and employees, you should consider your being here to be a calling, yes, a calling from the same prophetic source that inspired the founding of the school. &nbsp;Almost as if heavenly hands were placed on your head in a divine setting apart. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I remember what the late Professor Lance Chase said about this idea:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The message is that students and faculty alike must understand the studies here are designed to feed our Christ-like motives. Students need to know that their education is their prime calling from God in these years, that their education must be an act of love, even worship, of stewardship; in a way a wholehearted response to God…."(The Idea of a Mormon University, David O. McKay lecture, 1987.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This calling carries with it tremendous blessings and wonderful opportunities to learn now; and very high expectations in your future to serve the Lord with all your heart, might, mind and strength.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course many of you have to be employed in order to support your calling as a student. In the scores of narratives from alumni included in our book of history, there is a consensus that their employment on campus or at PCC was a learning experience equally valuable to their studies and was an immense blessing for them. That is, work was not simply the means to an end, but integral to their overall education. Employment to support yourself in school is not one of your enemies. &nbsp;The real enemies that often sabotage your divine appointment to study are: procrastination, excessive hanging out in person or through social media, and the so-called entertainment technology - video games and more video games. I beg you to stay in control.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Speaking of video games, as a quick aside, our daughter Merrilli and her husband took a two-week Church tour this summer in the United Kingdom. Among the group were four absolutely gorgeous, intelligent, articulate, fun-loving, vivacious young women from BYU Idaho - all returned missionaries. When Merrilli asked them about dating and their prospects for marriage, they said they dated little and had no prospects but then added: “All the eligible boys that we know are already engaged...with video games. We can’t compete with video games.” I hope that’s not true of the boys of BYU Hawaii. &nbsp;But that’s a subject of another talk at another time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Theme of Prayer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps one of the most consistent themes in the narratives submitted to the book by alumni and faculty is how prayer and acquiring the ability to receive answers to prayers sustained them throughout their schooling and their current lives of service. &nbsp;They have shared some of their most sacred encounters with deity. Each of these narratives reflects the Book of Mormon prophet Amulek’s admonition to all of us:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yea, cry unto [the Lord] for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</p>
<p>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</p>
<p>...Cry unto him... both morning, mid-day, and evening.</p>
<p>...Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</p>
<p>...But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</p>
<p>Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.18-27?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Alma 34: 18-27</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I would like to share a few responses from alumni about prayer. Herman Paleka first came to CCH as a non-LDS student in 1958, the fall the permanent campus was dedicated by then Church president and prophet, David O. McKay. He writes:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The afternoon after the dedication, I was sitting in the choir seats set up in the auditorium, just enjoying the quiet and the newness of the building, when in walked president David O. McKay. He sat in the middle of the room. I was suddenly moved by a strange and powerful feeling . . . &nbsp;that I had never felt before.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I later dated an LDS girl who was trying to share the gospel with me along with my two stake missionaries, Raymond Sasaki and Ishmael Stagner.… One day she asked if I say my prayers. I said sometimes. She asked if I would pray about the things we talked about.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I went into the hills in the back of the college to pray. As I prayed, the same feelings that I had in the auditorium came again…. In October 1960 I joined the church…."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Herman served a mission, graduated from this campus, and for years thereafter lived in Kauai. He became a popular professional educator, a bishop, stake president, and later as a missionary to Nigeria with his wife, Joan.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Victor Cave from Tahiti, a bishop, stake president, an area 70 and a member of the South Pacific area presidency, came to CCH in 1968, as a nonmember as well. In his narrative he said that he was taught the gospel on campus by the missionaries but had resisted their every effort to convert him. He writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One day as one of my dorm friends from the Philippines, Bien Flores, was leaving for class. He greeted me, then asked out loud: “Victor, when will you be baptized?” I replied, “Never.” He then asked why. I said because I don’t know that the church is true. Then walking away to class, he yelled words that hit my heart like a sledgehammer: “Why don’t you pray about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My roommate had already left for an early class that morning. So I went to my room, locked the door, and for the first time with real intent and a sincere desire, I knelt down to ask my Heavenly Father if this Church was true. No sooner had I begun to ask than I was overcome with tears to the point that I could not speak. I could only cry because the spirit replied to my heart that this is the Lord’s church, and it is the only true and living church on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nina Abuliz Foster (Class of 2004) and her husband John describe their first experiences with personal prayer in their journey of conversion to Christ and His Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Nina grew up in Urumqi, China. A native Uyger of Turkish descent and a Muslim, she became a professional dancer gaining national renown in China as a lead performer and MC at the famous Windows of the World in Shenzhen, China. It was there she met a visiting performing group from BYU Hawaii and heard her first Christian prayer by a BYU Hawaii student, Emily Shumway. Nina says,“In her prayer Emily asked Heavenly Father to bless me and for Angels to protect me. She also mentioned something about families could be together forever. To me, I had been in the desert, and this was water.”&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through a series of miracles Nina was able to leave her professional career and come to BYU Hawaii as a student. She became attached immediately to us, Emily’s parents and called us, Mom and Dad Shumway. Nina remembers her first uttered prayer to Heavenly Father, “I still remember feeling nervous and excited [about offering my first personal prayer]. It seemed that Mom Shumway could read my mind; she smiled warmly and told me ‘in prayer, nothing can go wrong.’ When I opened my mouth to pray and said ‘Dear Heavenly Father,’ that’s the moment my life changed, and I felt tears running down my face and felt the arms of Heavenly Father holding me up but overwhelming me at the same time. I felt I was speaking directly to him, and while it seemed I had known him for a very long time, it was very peaceful and powerful to finally actually speak to him. ... Our Father in Heaven loves each one of us and he wants us to love each other as brothers and sisters. For example, one day the president’s home was robbed and Mom Shumway lost some valuables. To my surprise instead of trying to call the police, she knelt down and prayed for the thief. Mom explained to me that he must have a very sad and difficult life. Her prayer really helped me understand that Heavenly Father loves all his children, even the thieves.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">John’s conversion to prayer and to the church was a short but intense journey. Born in Ecuador, raised in Texas, John spent 10 years working in China. Very intellectual and somewhat worldly he had graduated from an Ivy League school and spoke three languages brilliantly Spanish, English, and Chinese. Struck by Nina in their first meeting in Honolulu he pursued her romantically - which, of course, brought him into the orbit of the Shumway family. At our first meeting he charmingly described himself as one of the “nicer atheists.” &nbsp;Still we treated him in our home as any guest and invited him to join us in family prayer with Nina. At first he sat respectfully on the sofa while we knelt; several prayers later he actually knelt with us. &nbsp;At one point he consented to offer a prayer which was kind of an out loud meditation, neither mentioning Heavenly Father nor Jesus Christ. Eventually he addressed God but did not mention Jesus. As missionary discussions continued, I remember the thrill of his first prayer in which he addressed Heavenly Father, humbly and reverently, and concluded in the name of Jesus Christ amen. John wrote recently saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Through those family prayers the light of Christ turned on inside my mind. Through those prayers I decided that I too needed my own testimony. And then in my own prayers I found myself, eventually securing my marriage, and now my children and my life. Prayer changed everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">John and Nina were married on our patio in 2004 before she graduated. They had their first baby, Evan, the following year. Nina’s wonderful Muslim parents softened toward the church, thanks to a fireside they attended which featured Gordon B. Hinckley, and agreed to her baptism. John and Nina were baptized and sealed in the temple a year later.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today Nina writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Now I depend on prayers to get me through each day. I have a great faith in Heavenly Father, and love to pray to him. My days are filled with prayers, and through prayers, I put my children’s lives and their futures and their happiness in the hands of the Lord. Through prayers, my heart sings and my soul stretches close to heaven. Prayer is the core of my life. Through prayers I make righteous choices. I know that my prayers and choices will bring me back to live with Heavenly Father forever and ever."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of you may recognize Nina as your dance teacher here on campus.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the finest basketball players ever to compete for BYU Hawaii, Lucas Alves (class of 2010), now plays professional basketball in Brazil. When he arrived on campus in 2006, he knew very little English and very little about the Church. He tells about his resistance to the missionaries on campus and his relief when the bishop said he had told the missionaries to stop teaching him. The bishop said he already knew enough. It now must be his choice. “Finally,” he thought, “I get a break from the missionaries.” But then in his words he says:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"I kept feeling that I needed to kneel and pray. I needed to sincerely ask my Father in Heaven if this Church is true. There is not one part of my being that can deny the overwhelming spirit I felt the night I humbled myself and knelt down to whisper my heartfelt prayer. I knew that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was true. I had received my answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On November 21, 2009, I entered the waters of baptism. I was overwhelmed by the spirit and the support I received from so many loved ones. I felt sunshine in my soul. I look back and see how much the gospel has changed my life.… Through basketball, I was able to receive an education, become a member of the church, receive the holy priesthood, and get married in the temple to my wife, Vanessa. I learned that my life was so much more fulfilling with His hand near my side."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These former students, Herman, Victor, Nina, and Lucas represent a legacy of young people of this campus who chose to make a leap of faith; and humbly, meekly, and with real intent seek Heavenly Father in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Their reward was life-changing. Their faith aligned perfectly with the apostle Paul’s definition of faith as recorded in Hebrews 11:1: “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” The testimony of Christ and his true church was the substance of their hope. The overpowering witness of the Spirit within their souls was the evidence of things not seen – not seen but felt. And when you feel that powerful witness of the Spirit, it is not likely you will ever confuse it with a different emotions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Insights into Personal Prayer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A number of faculty who submitted narratives to the anniversary history of the campus tell of sacred experiences in prayer in which Heavenly Father speaks actual words to their mind and heart. Reading about these experiences filled my heart with joy, remembering again that this faculty not only teaches students, engaging them in professional ways, but they pray with and for their students. I’ll never forget years ago in a devotional assembly just before finals when Professor Sue Barton of the math department gave the closing prayer. She focused on the students, their needs, their fears, their challenges. She pleaded with the Lord to bless them as they prepared for the upcoming finals. Sue’s prayer was so full of love and of pure intent, it was recorded in my heart and found a place in my journal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, one of the great legacies of this campus is how companionship with deity through prayer has rescued and sustained individuals in their personal lives and professions. Ten years ago President Boyd K Packer spoke to BYU Hawaii graduates on the topic of how to receive answers to our prayers-- that is, how to receive revelation. In a very moving way he said, in our world, “the curtains are falling… [The world is in intense commotion and moral confusion]… You won’t survive spiritually unless you know how to receive revelation [that is, answers to prayers]… I don’t know whether you know how to receive revelation, but you won’t survive without it…."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I pondered President Packer’s talk I realized that as an institution of higher learning in the Church of Jesus Christ, if students learn everything else in math, science, in business or art and not learn this – how to receive answers to their prayers or receive personal revelation – then their education has failed them. Without this ability, a person will leave BYU Hawaii spiritually crippled and vulnerable in a world of many strident, often mocking voices; a world consumed by forces that destroy the soul – the forces of lust, greed, ambition for power, addiction, excessive leisure, violence, Godlessness, and pride.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One way we can improve our prayers is to remember that prayer is not just a monologue, one person doing the talking, but a conversation in which we speak and we listen. Sometimes Heavenly Father’s part of the conversation comes in actual words to our mind and sometimes in feelings to our heart. He will speak peace to our souls. Sometimes his words come in the language of scripture. That’s why it is important to read scriptures. There is truth in the old saying, we talk to God in prayer and he talks to us through the scriptures. But he will also speak to us in our prayers if we give him a chance. Remember father Alma’s admonition, “Counsel with the Lord in all our doings.” &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.37?lang=eng#36" target="_blank">Alma 37:37</a>) &nbsp;Counsel suggests two-way interaction. &nbsp;Also remember President Hinckley’s often quoted statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“...the trouble with most of our prayers is that we offer them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries – we place our order, and then hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of all we are praying about and for, and then speak to the Lord as one person speaketh to another. And then we must listen to how he will speak to our feelings.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me one of the high points of last General Conference was Elder Larry R. Lawrence’s promise that our prayers improve when, instead of asking Heavenly Father for blessings—that is, bless me, bless me, bless me--we ask questions, the fundamental question being “What lack I yet?” &nbsp;Who is it I should help? &nbsp;What is it I should do now? &nbsp;Often through the Holy Ghost, the Lord answers with words in our minds and feelings in our heart. &nbsp;Sometimes these words can be startling, words like “stop complaining” or “apologize to your roommate” or “get up and clean your room” or “cancel the movie and study.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes in the temple, people will ask me, “What is the meaning of this symbol?" Or "What is the significance of that gesture?” &nbsp;I have learned to say, “That is a great question. When you come back to the temple, bring that question with you and ask Heavenly Father, and if you ask with real intent and sincerity, he will reveal the meaning to you through the power of the Holy Ghost. For the Holy Ghost is the great teacher in the temple.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We must recognize and eliminate as much as possible the impediments to sincere prayer. Speed is a problem sometimes. We often talk too fast in our prayers. We rush through our list and even speed up when we pronounce the name of Jesus Christ. We must learn to speak the name of Jesus Christ slowly, with reverence and with sincere worship – in the name of Jesus Christ. Noise can also be a severe distraction, the pounding of rock music, the preoccupation with entertainment of all kinds, the endless engagement in social media. It is a kind of brain clutter. Even Christ left the company of his disciples and the multitudes to pray in the stillness of the hills of Judea and in quiet gardens. This in a small way might be equivalent to turning off your cell phones, closing your laptop, and seeking His Father and your Father. Brother Paleka sought him in the hills behind the campus. &nbsp;Victor, Nina, and Lucas Alves sought him in their own dorm rooms. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we sincerely seek the Father in prayer, let much of our thoughts and petition be focused outward from ourselves. We pray for others. We have great evidence that faculty and supporting staff here pray for their students. Students must also pray for their faculty. &nbsp;But one of the great leaps of faith which we take in prayer is to pray for a so-called enemy, someone who has hurt you; someone who has resented you or whom you have resented; someone you may dislike or who may dislike you. Can you think of someone in that category? Speak the name of your adversary to Heavenly Father. Ask forgiveness for your own feelings toward him or her. Something wonderful happens to us when we ask a blessing upon someone we might consider an adversary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Related to this, I remember a supernal learning experience when in my role as university president I was offended and angered by a person who seemed to cultivate a knack for offending people. “This was the last straw,” I said to myself, “he can’t get away with this.” &nbsp;In my so-called justified indignation, I crafted a stinging reprimand, which I practiced in my mind, and made an appointment to see the man in his office. Fortunately, I knelt down in my office just before the fateful appointment and pleaded for the Lord’s spirit to be with me as I delivered my prepared speech. The prayer was answered in a way I wasn’t expecting. Shortly, I faced my adversary, but when I opened my mouth, totally different words came out from the ones I had practiced - words of apology for my feelings toward him, words of love and appreciation for his contribution to the University, words that asked forgiveness of my own attitude, words that requested a respectful conversation in working out his issues. The man was as shocked, I believe, as I was by these words for he too was expecting a tongue lashing. So instead of an angry confrontation and perhaps a permanent breach in our personal and professional relationship, there were tears of reconciliation and an affirmation of friendship and cooperation. &nbsp;In the months that followed this man performed a major service that had immediate ramifications for good in strengthening the University, something that probably could not have happened if the Lord had not rescued me from destroying a relationship and in this case complicating the progress of the University.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is another aspect of prayer which we learn in the temple, which is also corroborated in scripture. It is just how important your prayers are to Heavenly Father. I have heard some zealous preachers declare in effect: “God does not need you, but you need him. God can get along without you, but you are nothing without him. It makes no difference to God.” This seems to be the tone of much hard-line religious doctrine. &nbsp;I believe it is patently false. I testify that your choices, good or bad, do make a difference to him, especially your choice not to seek him constantly in prayerful conversation. Heavenly Father’s love for you is beyond your ability to comprehend. He wants your fellowship. He wants you in his presence for eternity. His heart is set upon you. Your happiness is at the core of his great plan of mercy. Every one of Heavenly Father’s commandments is designed for your protection, your progress and ultimately your eternal joy. His work and his glory are to bring to pass your immortality, eternal life and exaltation. He wants you to choose him to be your Father and your God. He will not force you. He will not take away your freedom to choose his way of light or to choose other ways that lead to darkness; but he yearns to hear from you, rejoices when you choose to embrace spiritual things and sorrows when you choose differently. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the truth that amazed the prophet Enoch who, in vision, witnessed the weeping of God, the Eternal Father over the wickedness of his children on earth. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.28-41?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Moses 7:28-41</a>) Enoch’s initial response to Heavenly Father’s tears was complete bafflement. For how could the all-knowing, all-powerful, all holy, all glorified creator of the universe and all the worlds within – how could such an exalted being weep over what might be called scum of the earth? Because they are his! He created them. They are his children. He gave them their agency, their precious privilege to choose for themselves what they would follow. They were in the world to follow a plan of mercy that would bring them back into his presence, but they chose to follow Satan as their father and a way of life full of hate and violence. Enoch’s astonishment at Heavenly Father’s tears opened both his eyes and his whole soul to how important, how precious God’s children are to him. &nbsp;This universal truth finally dawned on Enoch. He understood deeply and completely this compelling character trait of deity. As the scriptures state, wherefore “Enoch knew, and [he too] looked upon their wickedness [of the world], and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and his heart swelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook.” &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.41?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">Moses 7:41</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With all my heart I testify that Heavenly Father wants you to call upon him regularly. He wants you to achieve happiness. His gospel and the covenants we make with him are the avenue to happiness. Again, his heart is set upon you. He not only desires your happiness but desires your fellowship. He wants you in his presence as you pray for his presence in your life. That message is central to all that we learn in his church and especially in the temple, to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha!</p>
<p>We have lived in Park City, Utah, for over 20 years. Park City was the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics and is home to three world-class ski resorts. It’s a big time ski town. My favorite area is Deer Valley. On a powder day I know where to go to find first tracks in untouched snow. But when we were new to town I had to learn my way around the mountain.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I skied one particular run called The Ruins of Pompeii. It’s a double black diamond. It starts off steep and then in the middle it has an even steeper section. My first time down I wasn’t sure what was ahead so I was skiing carefully. When I came to the steep section I stopped to catch my breath and look down the slope to pick out my line. While I was standing there looking over the run, I heard another skier approaching. He was obviously a good skier and was skiing fast. When he came to the steep section he let out a whoop, caught a little air and went over the edge. I watched him do some nice turns and then ski out of sight. I was impressed.</p>
<p>I pushed off and carefully navigated the steep section with five or six turns. Then I stopped again and looked back up the slope. I was surprised at how much easier it looked from the bottom, especially now that I had completed it. Pleased with myself I completed the run and jumped on the lift.</p>
<p>Returning to the Ruins of Pompeii again I skied the upper section feeling pretty good. When the steep section came in sight I noticed a skier stopped where I had been, peering over the edge. So what do you think I did? Exactly. I picked up a little speed, let out a whoop, caught a very little air, and skied right over the edge. I laid down my turns and continued out of sight.</p>
<p>What was the difference between the two runs for me? Confidence. The first experience gave me confidence to do much better the second time down. And that’s what I want to talk about today. Confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a marvelous scripture in Doctrine and Covenants, Section 121:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45-46?lang=eng#44" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:45-46</a>)</p>
<p>Those are very powerful promises and beautiful blessings contingent on our developing some key Christ-like attributes. But “confident” is not normally the way that we see ourselves if we should find ourselves in the presence of God. We tend to think of ourselves as Moses did after being transfigured so that he could talk with God and then returning to his mortal state. He fell to the earth and after many hours he regained his strength and then observed, “Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Moses 1:10</a>)</p>
<p>Or we think of ourselves as some of the Nephites did. Just before Christ visited the Nephites there was a great division among the people. “Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">3 Nephi 6:13</a>)</p>
<p>But true humility, the humility that God wants from us, is developed by keeping the commandments and drawing close to God. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are thus directed, “Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 112:10</a>)</p>
<p>God does not ask us to cower in His presence. He wants us to gain personal strength and draw closer to Him. In fact, the only one that wants us to fall down and worship him is Satan. After the Savior’s 40-day fast, Satan took him to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms and glory of the earth and then tempted him saying, “All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">Matthew 4:9</a>)</p>
<p>The American theologian Tryon Edwards said, "True humility is not an abject, groveling, self-despising spirit; it is but a right estimate of ourselves as God sees us."</p>
<p>Elder Glen L. Pace addressed this topic from an LDS perspective:</p>
<p>“Many Latter-day Saints have unhealthy feelings about their own inadequacies, real or imagined. The scriptures inform us that we all have weaknesses and that there is a place for them in our spiritual progress: “If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.”</p>
<p>My wife and I were here on campus for a year six years ago. While we were here I taught Religion 130, the Missionary Preparation class. In one of our lessons each semester we talked about making the Atonement active in our lives. As part of that lesson I asked all of the students to close their eyes and put their heads down on their desks. Then I asked them to consider this question, “If you were to die today, do you think you would go to the Celestial Kingdom? If your answer is Yes, then raise your hand.”</p>
<p>I had 30-40 students in each of those classes. How many hands do you think went up? Only three or four hands, and even those would be pretty shaky. Even allowing for the awkwardness of the classroom setting those are pretty bad results. And they shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I say to you now as I said to the class, “If not you, then who?” You are all baptized into the The Church of Jesus Christ, you attend His university, many of you have served or are preparing to serve full-time missions. You attend church every week and partake of the sacrament. You do many acts of service both here on campus and in the community. If not you, then who?&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Too often we wallow in our weaknesses,” continues Elder Pace. “Our condition is frequently misdiagnosed as humility, when in reality it is a lack of confidence. What is the difference between the two?</p>
<p>To be humble is to recognize our utter dependence upon the Lord. We are conscious of our strengths, but we do not exalt ourselves and become prideful, for we know that all good things ultimately come from God. We are conscious of our weaknesses, but we know the Lord can use those very weaknesses to bless our lives and that through Him, our weaknesses can become strengths.</p>
<p>To lack confidence is to have feelings of low self-worth. We are preoccupied with our weaknesses, and we lack faith in the Lord’s ability to use those weaknesses for our good. We do not understand our inestimable worth in the eyes of God, nor do we appreciate our divine potential. Ironically, both pride and a lack of self-confidence cause us to focus excessively on ourselves and to deny the power of God in our lives.” (Ensign, Jan 2005)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confidence comes from knowing that we are right with God, that we are aligned with God’s will and doing what he would have us do. The Brother of Jared displayed this confidence, but not initially.</p>
<p>The Brother of Jared built the barges to cross the ocean as he was directed, but then he discovered that he had two problems; no air because the barges were tight like a dish, and no light. So he went to the Lord for help. The Lord solved the first problem by giving the Brother of Jared the solution. But for the second problem He asked, “What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?”</p>
<p>Seeing that it was up to him, the Brother of Jared went to great lengths to do his part. He went to an exceedingly high mount, and he did molten sixteen small stones out of rock until they were white and clear as glass. Then he presented them to the Lord and asked Him to touch the stones to provide the light they needed. The Lord did so, and when He touched the stones, the Brother of Jared saw the finger of the Lord. He was struck with fear and fell to the ground. That doesn’t sound like a guy full of confidence, does it?</p>
<p>When the Lord asked why he had fallen to the ground he answered, “I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me.” The Lord then explained that he had seen the finger of the Lord because of his great faith and asked “Sawest thou more than this?”</p>
<p>Now the Brother of Jared turns from fear to confidence. “Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.”</p>
<p>Because of that confidence, The Lord then asks him one of the greatest questions in all of the scriptures, “Believest thou the words which I shall speak?”</p>
<p>Think about that question for a second and all that is implied in those few words, “Believest thou the words which I shall speak?”. He didn’t ask, “Do you believe all the things that I have said in the past? or Do you love Me? or Do you trust Me? or Will you keep all of my commandments?” He just said, “Do you believe what I’m about to say?”</p>
<p>Then the Brother of Jared gave the right answer. “Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.” Then the Lord showed himself to him and told him that he was redeemed from the Fall and brought back into His presence. What a glorious moment, maybe the ultimate confidence builder.</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer had an experience where he was taught the way to gain confidence. He says, “Shortly after I was called as a General Authority, I went to Elder Harold B. Lee for counsel. He listened very carefully to my problem and suggested that I see President David O. McKay. President McKay counseled me as to the direction I should go. I was very willing to be obedient but saw no way possible for me to do as he counseled me to do.</p>
<p>“I returned to Elder Lee and told him that I saw no way to move in the direction I was counseled to go. He said, ‘The trouble with you is you want to see the end from the beginning.’ I replied that I would like to see at least a step or two ahead. Then came the lesson of a lifetime: ‘You must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a few steps into the darkness; then the light will appear and show the way before you.’</p>
<p>President James E. Faust said, “Let us not take counsel from our fears. May we remember always to be of good cheer, put our faith in God, and live worthy for Him to direct us. We are each entitled to receive personal inspiration to guide us through our mortal probation. May we so live that our hearts are open at all times to the whisperings and comfort of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf tells this story about trusting in the Lord and gaining confidence.“During a busy season of my life, Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin extended a call to me to serve as stake president.</p>
<p>“During my interview with him, many thoughts raced through my mind, not the least of which was the unsettling worry that I might not have the time this calling would require. Although I felt humbled and honored by the call, I briefly wondered if I could accept it. But it was only a fleeting thought because I knew that Elder Wirthlin was called of God and that he was doing the Lord’s work. What could I do but accept?</p>
<p>“There are times when we have to step into the darkness in faith, confident that God will place solid ground beneath our feet once we do. And so I accepted gladly, knowing that God would provide.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I’d like to give some practical suggestions to increase our spiritual confidence. The first six come from a talk that Elder Jörg Klebingat of The Seventy gave in General Conference in October, 2014 and then I will add a couple more.</p>
<p>Number 1. Take responsibility for our own <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spiritual</span> well-being.</p>
<p>Don’t blame others, don’t blame your circumstances.&nbsp; Stop justifying, and stop making excuses for why you may not be fully striving to be obedient. It is time to give up your favorite sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Some of us have a misguided view of the God-given gift of agency. We think that we have our “free agency” which means that we get to choose for ourselves. But the term “free agency” does not appear once in the scriptures and the only free agents I know of are professional athletes. The Lord has given us our “agency” and we are free to choose, but the choice is clear; we are “free to choose liberty and eternal life, …or to choose captivity and death.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:27</a>) We are free to choose, but we are not free to choose the consequences that follow our choices. There is no middle ground. As a philosopher observed, “When you pick up one end of a stick, you also pick up the other.”</p>
<p>The Lord knows our circumstances perfectly, but He also knows perfectly well if we simply choose not to fully live the gospel. If that is the case, be honest enough to admit it, and make the changes that are required in your set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when we take responsibility for our own spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>Number 2. Take responsibility for our own <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physical</span> well-being.</p>
<p>Our soul consists of our body and spirit. Feeding the spirit while neglecting the body, usually leads to a spiritual imbalance and lowered self-esteem.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson has taught that we should “regard our body as a temple of our very own” and that we should “control our diet and exercise for physical fitness.”</p>
<p>If you are out of shape, if you are uncomfortable in your own body and can do something about it, then do it! Use good judgment in what and especially how much you eat. Regularly give your body the exercise it needs and deserves. If you are physically able, decide today to be the master of your own temple and begin a regular, long-term exercise program, suited to your abilities, combined with a healthier diet.</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when our spirit, with the help of the Savior, is in charge of our natural man or woman.</p>
<p>Number 3. Embrace voluntary, wholehearted obedience.</p>
<p>The Savior’s standard is clear and simple: “If ye love me, keep my commandments”. Selective obedience brings selective blessings. Also, we must do the right things for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Adam, when he was driven out of the Garden of Eden, provides a perfect model of obedience. Remember that he had been friends and played with the animals in the Garden. Then God gave him the law of sacrifice to teach him about the atonement. He obeyed but it must have been a difficult commandment to keep. “And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.” That is our example of obedience, or as we say in the mission field, Exact Obedience, to the commandments of God.</p>
<p>Remember that casualness in spiritual matters never was happiness. Make the Church and the restored gospel your whole life, not just a part of your outward or social life.</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when we are truly striving, for the right reasons, to live a consecrated life in spite of our imperfections!</p>
<p>Number 4. Become really, really good at repenting.</p>
<p>Establish an attitude of ongoing, happy, joyful repentance by making it your lifestyle of choice.</p>
<p>Most of us wouldn’t go out in the sun without applying some sort of sunscreen. Because the Atonement of Jesus Christ is very practical and available to all, we should apply it generously 24/7, for it never runs out. Beware of the temptation to procrastinate and just repent.</p>
<p>Hugh Nibley, one of our greatest Mormon scholars, said it this way. “Who is righteous? Anyone who is repenting. No matter how bad he has been, if he is repenting he is a righteous man. There is hope for him. And no matter how good he has been all his life, if he is not repenting, he is a wicked man. The difference is which way you are facing. The man on the top of the stairs facing down is much worse off than the man on the bottom step who is facing up.”</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when we voluntarily and joyfully repent of our sins, both great and small, by applying the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Number 5. Become really, really good at forgiving.</p>
<p>Forgive everyone, for everything, all the time, or at least strive to do so, thus allowing forgiveness into our own lives. Don’t hold grudges, don’t be easily offended. Learn to forgive and forget quickly.</p>
<p>President Hinckley said, “"I think [forgiveness] may be the greatest virtue on earth, and certainly the most needed. There is so much of meanness and abuse, of intolerance and hatred. There is so great a need for repentance and forgiveness. It is the great principle emphasized in all of scripture, both ancient and modern. Somehow forgiveness, with love and tolerance, accomplishes miracles that can happen in no other way."</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when we know that the Lord knows that we harbor no ill will toward any other soul.</p>
<p>Number 6. Accept trials and setbacks as part of our mortal experience.</p>
<p>Remember that we are here to be proved and tested.</p>
<p>Some trials come through our own disobedience or negligence. Other trials come because of the negligence of others or simply because this is a fallen world. When these trials come, try to force a smile and say, “I understand, Lord. I know what this is. A time to prove myself, isn’t it?” Then partner with Him to endure well to the end.</p>
<p>When Joseph Smith cried out to the Lord from Liberty Jail, the Lord told him:</p>
<p>“My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</p>
<p>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7-8?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:7-8</a>)</p>
<p>…Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. “(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 122:7</a>)</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when we accept that trials and tribulations are part of life and all of this will be for our good.</p>
<p>And now let me add two more suggestions from the verses in D&amp;C 121.</p>
<p>Number 7. Let virtue garnish they thoughts unceasingly.</p>
<p>Modern computers may have parallel processing, and some of you may think you have learned how to multitask, but the human mind can only process one conscious thought at a time.</p>
<p>Scientists have calculated that each of us has over 50,000 thoughts each day. We make a choice, a conscious choice, to pursue or ignore each thought that enters our mind. The ability to control our thoughts, to focus on virtuous thoughts is a pure Christ-like attribute.</p>
<p>Elder Scott told us in a training seminar what he did to stay focused on virtuous subjects. He travelled a lot in his church service. He said that whenever they showed a movie on the airplane he would busy himself in his work at his seat and never look at the screen. Why? Because he didn’t even want the images that he might see to enter his mind.</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases when we learn to control our thoughts and spend more time on subjects that are both virtuous and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>And lastly, Number 8, Have charity towards all men.</p>
<p>There is a wise saying that goes, There are two kinds of people in the world; those that you love and those that you don’t yet know. The more we get to know people and their situations and their challenges, the better we like them.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to give people the benefit of the doubt. And the best way to get to know someone is to do for them selfless acts of service.</p>
<p>Spiritual confidence increases as we seek to serve those around us.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Confidence is a key to success, both in our earthly endeavors, like skiing, and in our striving to return to the presence of God. As we follow each of these suggestions we will give a celestial boost to our own self-confidence and our confidence before God. We will greet each new day with a healthy optimism. We will meet our friends and make new acquaintances with calm self-assurance. And, as promised in D&amp;C 121, we will more fully understand the doctrines of the gospel, the Holy Ghost will be our constant companion, people will recognize us as pillars of righteousness, and other blessings will flow unto us, unbidden, forever and ever.</p>
<p>Of this, I bear my solemn witness. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>October 13, 2015<br />Mark Piena<br />President, Makakilo Hawaii Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My dear brothers and sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am deeply grateful to stand before you today. I want to express my gratitude to President Wheelwright for the invitation to speak, and to President Tanner for allowing me to carry out this assignment. I am grateful to the staff and personnel who work behind the scenes to make these devotionals possible. I am grateful for goodly parents that raised me well and taught me at an early age to love the Lord and to serve my fellow man. I am grateful that they are able to be here today. I am grateful for my family, for the joy and purpose they bring into my life. I've prepared for this assignment in the spirit of prayer and fasting, and I pray that you will hear the messages you need to hear, especially those messages that are not spoken across this pulpit, but are spoken directly to your heart. It is my hope that the Spirit will attend us, that we may “understand one another”, and be “edified and rejoice together”. (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">D&amp;C 50:22</a>)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a student here some twenty-five plus years ago, I used to look forward to devotionals. It strengthened my faith, and seemed to give me just what I needed to make it through the week. I must admit, however, this was one devotional I was not&nbsp;looking forward to. As I think back to all the great speakers and lessons that were taught, never did I ever think I'd be standing here, at this pulpit, as a devotional speaker. At the Groundbreaking Services of this great institution on February 12, 1955, President David O. McKay made the following declaration, “From this school... will go men and women whose influence will be felt for good towards the establishment of peace internationally.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“More than that, they'll be leaders. Not only in this island, but everywhere.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, you are part of this great promise. This institution has been blessed and dedicated to produce leaders that will be vessels of light and truth throughout the world. As I look into the congregation, I see business leaders; leaders in the community; leaders in education; church leaders such as Relief Society, Primary, and Young Women Presidents; Bishops; Stake Presidents; Temple Presidents, and Mission Presidents; but above all, I see leaders in families; families being raised and rooted in righteousness. The Lord needs you to be ready to embark in His service. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ability to embark on and complete any journey successfully takes preparation. Several months ago, I had the privilege of attending a presentation given by a good friend of mine about the worldwide voyage of the Hokule'a. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Hokule’a is a double-hulled canoe that was conceptualized and built in the 1970’s by the Polynesian Voyaging Society. Their mission is to “perpetuate the art and science of traditional Polynesian voyaging,” and to revitalize and perpetuate language and culture. As I listened to the presentation, I saw many parallels and connections to gospel principles. I will share some of these similarities in my thoughts today.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Hokule’a is led by a Master Navigator, who has spent years and years of learning, practicing, and studying the elements of ancient navigational practices. The crew begins by learning the basics of building, cleaning, and maintaining the canoe. They learn to recognize and understand the fundamental elements of nature, such as the wind, ocean, stars, sun, moon, and animals. Eventually, they set out on small and simple voyages, which gradually increase in distance and difficulty. Each journey is carefully planned and organized with origination and destination firmly in mind. Just as the Hokule’a prepares for their journeys, we too must be prepared as we embark in the service of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the April 2015 General Conference, Elder M. Russell Ballard extended his previous counsel to missionaries to all young adults. He said, “...what we need now is the greatest generation of young adults in the history of the church. We need your whole heart and soul. We need vibrant, thinking, passionate young adults who know how to listen and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit as you make your way through the daily trials and temptations of being a young, contemporary Latter-day saint. In other words, it’s time to raise the bar not only for missionaries, but also for returned missionaries and for your entire generation.” (M. Russell Ballard, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Greatest Generation of Young Adults</a>,” Ensign, May 2015, 68)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord made a simple declaration, “Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">D&amp;C 4:3</a>). I invite you to ponder a few questions. Do you have desires to serve God? &nbsp;If God “called you to the work” today, would you be ready? What type of tool or instrument would you be in His hands?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a young missionary serving in the Dominican Republic, my Mission President taught the principle of being instruments in the Lord’s hands with an object lesson that has stayed with me to this day. He held up an 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper and said the objective was to cut this sheet of paper in half, and success would be measured in two ways. First, the cut had to be straight and clean. And second, it had to be completed in the least amount of time. He called on several volunteers and had, hidden under a sheet, a tool for each person to complete their assignment. The first Elder was confident and eager to get started, until he received his tool.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He was given a pickaxe. While a pickaxe is certainly a tool, it is not the best tool for cutting paper. The Elder tried his best to figure out how to use this tool to accomplish the task. &nbsp;He tried cutting the paper with the pick end, then using the axe. He even tried using the handle. It was awkward and cumbersome, and despite his best efforts, his paper was simply ripped into shreds. The next volunteers were a little cautious, but were told that their tools were actually made for cutting. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They were made for cutting alright, they received a nail clipper, a pair of wire cutters, and a hand saw. While all of these tools were made to cut something in some way, none were effective at fulfilling the mission. The volunteers tried to get creative. The Elder with the nail clipper extended the handle and tried to use it as a straight edge. The missionary with the hand saw tried using the back edge of the saw to carefully tear the paper in half, trying to make as clean a cut as possible. All of this extra maneuvering took extra time, and produced meager results at best.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, the last volunteer was given a pair of scissors. As you might expect, he quickly and easily made a clean, straight cut. Abraham Lincoln is credited with the saying, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” The right tools in the Master’s hands can craft beyond comprehension, and establish even eternal designs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you embark in the service of God, what type of instrument will you be? Are you an instrument that the Lord can use to hasten His work, or would the Lord find the effort to be awkward or cumbersome? Will you be a sharpened, well-honed tool, or a nail clipper, trying to do a job that requires scissors? The standard of service set by the beloved Elder Robert D. Hales is a shining example of a sharpened tool in the Master’s hands. “When Robert D. Hales was a graduate student at Harvard University, he was called to be the president of his Elders quorum. He was willing to accept the call. But he also knew that because of the intensity of the courses required in his Masters of Business Administration program, professors discouraged students from participating in outside activities. He and his wife, Mary, prayed for guidance and discussed the calling together. As they did, Mary said, “I’d rather have an active priesthood holder than a man who holds a master’s degree from Harvard. We’ll do them both.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next day when Robert came home from school, he discovered that Mary had walled off a section of the unfinished basement in their apartment to create a small office. The office would give Robert a place where he could concentrate on his studies, so that he would be better able to fulfill his Elders quorum calling. As Elder Hales stated, “I put myself in the Lord’s hands when I made that decision [to serve]” (Hales, Robert D. “<a href="https://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/what-are-prophets/bio/robert-d-hales?lang=eng" target="_blank">Prophets and Apostles</a>.” Lds.org. N.p., n.d. Web)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Monson gave the following guidance. “My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness. We are the Lord’s hands here upon the earth with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us.” (Thomas S. Monson, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2014/02/serve-the-lord-with-love?lang=eng" target="_blank">Serve the Lord with Love</a>,” Ensign, Feb. 2014)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May I share three simple things you can implement now to be more effective as you embark in the Lord’s service. &nbsp;But I must warn you, you’ve heard this counsel before.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simple thing #1: Search the scriptures daily. President Harold B. Lee taught that if we are not studying the scriptures daily, “our testimonies are growing thinner” (“Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee”, Ch. 7, 66). &nbsp;The iron rod that guides us through the mists of darkness and the temptations of the world is the word of God, and will “tell you all things what ye should do” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">2 Nephi 32:3</a>). The scriptures will open our minds to our true and everlasting heritage, “for in them ye think ye have eternal life” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">John 5:39</a>). When I was set apart as a Stake President by Elder James B. Martino of the Seventy, he told us of a Ward Primary that challenged their children to read the scriptures for 100 days in a row. If a day was missed for any reason, that child would have to start the 100 days all over again. It was a difficult challenge, but those who were able to complete it, have developed a habit that will bless their lives in an eternal way. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today, brothers and sisters, I would like to issue you that same 100-day challenge. There are no requirements as to how much you need to read each day or for how long. The only stipulation is if you miss a day for any reason, you have to start all over again. You don’t have to answer out loud, but will you accept the 100-day challenge starting today? And for those who might be thinking this is too hard, might I remind you that this was initially issued to Primary children. I hope you will take the challenge. Simple thing #1, search the scriptures daily.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simple thing #2: Kneel in daily, fervent prayer. “As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely that God is our Father, and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive” (Bible Dictionary, “Prayer”, 752). &nbsp;We are commanded to pray always to the Father in the name of the Son (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">3 Nephi 18:19-20</a>), and to counsel with Him in all our doings (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.37?lang=eng#36" target="_blank">see Alma 37:37</a>). Simple thing #2, kneel in daily, fervent prayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simple thing #3: Live the Law of the Fast. In my experience as a Bishop, and now as a Stake President, I have observed far too many Latter-day Saints who miss out on the blessings and miracles that can come from fasting. &nbsp;“Fasting is a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ for developing spiritual strength” (Bible Dictionary, “Fasts”, 671) and increased blessings from the Lord. A generous fast offering helps us to develop compassion and empathy, and to love our neighbor, just as the Savior did. Simple thing #3, live the Law of the Fast.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sons of Mosiah were some of the best missionaries in recorded history to ever embark in the service of God, and showed what can happen when these three small and simple things become part of our daily lives. “Yea, they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy and revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2-3?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Alma 17:2-3</a>). These are just a few simple things we can do as we embark in the Lord’s service.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the course of any journey, there will be dangers and detours to avoid. One of the things that impressed me about the crew of the Hokule’a, was their mastery of identifying and following the correct elements to chart their journey. At night, amongst a myriad of flickering stars and planets, they learned to recognize the stars that were constant and true in their orbital path. These celestial bodies, just like the sun, always rise in the east and set in the west giving the Hokule’a a steady course to follow. When the stars were covered by clouds and/or during the day, the crew would use ocean swells to determine their direction. This can be quite challenging as there could be as many as nine distinct swells hitting the canoe from all different angles, at different speeds and different intensities. Amidst the chaos and confusion, the Captain finds the one or two swells that are constant and will help them keep their direction and stay the course. Amid the swirling tides of this world, we must look to the source of all that is constant and true. “And I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever, and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">2 Nephi 27:23</a>). We must become masters at recognizing and rejecting “that cunning plan of the evil one” and the “vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.28?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:28</a>). We see examples of societal ills all around us where the devil persuades man to “call evil good, and good evil” and to “put darkness for light, and light for darkness” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Isaiah 5:20</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Quentin L. Cook taught in this most recent General Conference, “The restored gospel gives us the blueprint of the plan of happiness and an incentive to understand and exercise self-control and avoid temptation. It also teaches us how to repent when violations have occurred” (Quentin L. Cook, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times?lang=eng" target="_blank">Shipshape and Bristol Fashion</a>: Be Temple Worthy—in Good Times and Bad,” Oct. 2015 General Conference). &nbsp;Essential to our happiness in this plan is the principle of obedience, the first law in Heaven. The Savior made a simple and heart-felt invitation when he said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">John 14:15</a>). If keeping His commandments shows Him that we love Him, what do we show Him when we disobey? What message do we send when we show disinterest or disregard for the counsel of His prophets? “Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">D&amp;C 1:38</a>). May we heed His voice and the voice of His servants to avoid unnecessary heartache and sorrow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trials and adversity are an essential part of our mortal journey. It is the process that refines and strengthens us. If you will allow me, I’d like to share a personal experience of a trial that was a defining moment for our family. May 2001 started off as a promising month. Our second daughter, Mehana, was born on May 2nd, and I had just been offered a new job on May 3rd. As my wife was released from the maternity ward, she complained of some tingling in her ear. We didn’t think anything of it and proceeded for home. As the day progressed, the tingling started in her fingertips and toes and got a little stronger. By the next morning, it had progressed through her hands and up her feet. We went to the Emergency Room to seek some answers. After a battery of tests, nothing was found and we were about to be sent home. Luckily, a neurologist heard about our case and came down to the ER to investigate. Within minutes, Moana was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare disorder that causes the body’s immune system to attack the nerves. Within two days, she lost her ability to control her muscles which affected her capacity to walk, swallow, and breathe. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and put on life support. Her situation continued to worsen and she eventually became paralyzed from the neck down. In a matter of days, we went from feeling on top of the world, to having our world turned upside down. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although my wife was the one in the hospital affected by the disorder, the weight of the trial was felt by many. I felt like I was being pushed to the edge. I had a two-year old and a newborn at home, I was supposed to start a new job, and my eternal companion was lying lifeless in the ICU full of tubes, and my mind was full of unanswered questions. I remember coming home early one morning after staying at hospital all night. My parents, sister and brother-in-law were at my house taking care of my children, so my mom suggested I go to her house to get some uninterrupted rest. As soon as I entered their home, I felt as if the weight of everything that was happening hit me all at once and I literally fell to the floor and poured my heart out to my Heavenly Father. I was exhausted, scared, and overwhelmed. I don’t remember what I said other than, “Heavenly Father, please help me.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I awoke the next morning, I felt different. The worries and concerns were still there, but I felt a reassurance that Heavenly Father was in control, that this adversity was part of a divine plan, and things would be okay. Without realizing it, I started to notice all the blessings Heavenly Father had given us. We had two beautiful, precious children at home. Our families and friends came out in droves to offer food, money, service, and their love and support. Moana’s co-workers donated sick leave, some of whom she had never met. Her students at school wrote get well cards and we had them plastered all over her hospital room. I remembered the ward held a special fast on our behalf the day she was admitted to the hospital. One of the bishopric counselors called and asked what he could do to help. I asked him to fast and pray for us. By that afternoon, our ward had gathered at the chapel, and as a ward family knelt in prayer and started a fast. My dad was asked to offer the prayer. Though I wasn’t there, I can bear testimony that I felt their genuine love and concern for our family. &nbsp;I was strengthened because of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My new job allowed me to delay my start date a full month until things started to settle down. Though Moana was still paralyzed, she was no longer on morphine and other painkillers, so she was awake. She couldn’t move her hands and feet, but she could blink her eyes and move her head. The nurses gave us a chart with letters listed in rows and we would spell words. A head shake to the right meant “no,” a blink meant “yes.” &nbsp;We got to be pretty good at communicating and could actually have conversations. It became a challenge to see how fast I could guess what she was trying to say. As the nerves started to heal, and feeling and sensation slowly returned, her favorite phrase became, “I’m itchy.” She started to regain her motor skills, and movement slowly returned in her arms and legs. Soon she was sitting up and learning to breathe without the breathing machine. Within four-and-a-half weeks she was out of ICU and on to rehab. Within another two weeks she was home. She needed a wheel chair for a while, but with hard work, patience, the love and support of others, and the tender mercies of the Lord, she quickly progressed to a walker, then a cane, and eventually a full recovery. I cannot adequately express all the blessings we received from so many people. But I know without a doubt my Heavenly Father knew exactly what was happening, and knew exactly what we needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During this ordeal, the inevitable questions surfaced. Why me? Why us? But as soon as the questions appeared, so did the answers. Why not? Why not us? Though we are far from being perfect, we were both born of goodly parents, and taught the gospel since our infancy. If others have to suffer adversity, why not us? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands or murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all. &nbsp;Art thou greater than he?” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7-8?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 122:7-8</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trial and tribulation are necessary parts of the Plan of Redemption. Our growth and progression, both in mortality and in the eternities, largely depend on how we respond. The Savior revealed, “And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">Abraham 3:25</a>). “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/16.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">John 16:33</a>). &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who knows me and is fully aware of my well-being. I am grateful for a selfless, loving Savior, who descended below all because of love. I am grateful for second chances, and in my case, third, fourth, and fifth chances. May we be prepared to embark in His service through daily scripture study, daily prayer, and living the Law of the Fast. As we do so, we will be guided through the dangers and detours of life, and sustained through trial and adversity. Our Heavenly Father will bless us to enjoy the fruits of our journey, that we might delight in the blessings of our Celestial destination. O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before him at the last day” is my prayer, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media151006<br><title>What is the Desire of Your Heart? | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>October 6, 2015<br />Randy D. Funk <br />Of the Seventy, First Counselor, Asia Area Presidency<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Funk and I were privileged to accompany President and Sister Tanner on a visit to Indonesia and Cambodia last year. We are pleased to be with them again and for their appointment to lead this fine university.</p>
<p>We are very grateful to be on this beautiful campus with all of you today and pray that the Spirit will be with each of us during our time together.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We Obtain the Desires of our Heart</span></p>
<p>When I first met Sister Funk she was dating a young man whom I knew. As a college student he had a strong desire to be successful in business. Forty years later, he has achieved that desire. He owns many properties and businesses and is wealthy. Not long ago, I asked Sister Funk if she ever thought she made a mistake when she stopped dating him and started dating me. Her response is one for which I am very grateful. She said, “I never desired to be wealthy, I desired to be happy, and I am very happy I married you.”</p>
<p>One of the important lessons we learn from the Book of Mormon is that ultimately we obtain the desires of our heart. There are numerous examples in the Book of Mormon of people finding joy and happiness or finding wickedness, according to their desires.&nbsp;When Alma encouraged his wayward son Corianton to repent, he taught, “it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.”<a href="#1">[1]&nbsp;</a> He then added, “The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires to do evil...” <a href="#2">[2]</a></p>
<p>We learn that our happiness depends less on the circumstances around us and more on living the commandments of God. Think of the time of Captain Moroni, a time of war and much difficulty, yet for those who were faithful in keeping the commandments, “there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni.”<a href="#3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Even growing up in similar circumstances in the same family, we can choose good or evil, happiness or misery, and the reason usually relates to the desires of our heart. Laman and Lemuel were taught by the same goodly parents as Nephi and Sam and saw many of the same miracles. Their father Lehi was “desirous that [his] family should partake” of the fruit of the tree of life<a href="#4">[4]</a> , but Laman and Lemuel “would not come unto [him] and partake of the fruit”<a href="#5">[5]</a> and did not experience the joy described by their father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Alma the elder invited those assembled at the waters of Mormon to come into the fold of God and described the responsibilities and blessings for those who do so, he asked, “if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord…that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?”<a href="#6">[6]</a> When the people heard these words, “they clapped their hands for joy and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.”<a href="#7">[7]</a> And they were baptized.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Desires Direct Our Decisions</span></p>
<p>Our desires direct our decisions. And as President Monson has taught, decisions determine destiny. <a href="#8">[8]</a></p>
<p>So my question for each of you today is this: “What is the desire of your heart?”&nbsp; What is it you truly want for your life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>With your knowledge of the gospel and a BYU-Hawaii education, you have the opportunity to make important choices regarding where to live, what to do, and how to serve. Your opportunities and choices are much greater than those your parents or grandparents enjoyed. Many of you are considering those important decisions right now as you plan and prepare for your future. So I repeat, “What is the desire of your heart?”</p>
<p>As you sincerely contemplate that question, let me encourage you to develop three foundational desires that will influence for good your other desires and decisions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desire to Receive and Always have the Holy Ghost to be with You</span></p>
<p>After the Savior’s first day of ministering to the Nephites, He departed<a href="#9">[9]</a> and the people returned to their homes.&nbsp; hey spoke to others about their experience and told them that Jesus would show Himself to them again on the morrow. The next day the multitude was so great that the newly called disciples separated them into twelve groups and ministered unto them, “nothing varying from the words Jesus had spoken.”<a href="#10">[10]&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Something then happened that teaches us an important principle. The disciples prayed. What did they pray for?&nbsp; Remember the setting. This large multitude had gathered to be with the Savior of the world. These new disciples, called just the day before, had faithfully taught what Jesus taught, nothing varying, and now they prayed. It seems the likely thing to pray for, what many of us may do in that situation, would be to pray that Jesus would return very soon. But that is not what the disciples did.</p>
<p>The scriptures record, “And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.”<a href="#10">[11]&nbsp;</a> Interestingly, the thing they most desired was not that Jesus would return quickly.&nbsp; Instead, they desired the Holy Ghost. After they prayed they went down into the water and Nephi, who had been given authority to baptize the day before, baptized those whom Jesus had chosen. When they came up out of the water they were “filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”<a href="#12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The invitation and admonition to each of us when we were confirmed a member of this Church was: “receive the Holy Ghost.”&nbsp;Elder David A. Bednar has taught, “these four words are not a passive pronouncement; rather, they constitute a priesthood injunction—an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26?lang=eng#25">2 Nephi 2:26</a>). ...As we receive this ordinance, each of us accepts a sacred and ongoing responsibility to desire, to seek, to work, and to so live that we indeed “receive the Holy Ghost” and its attendant spiritual gifts.”<a href="#13">[13]</a></p>
<p>When Jesus did appear, He went off from the multitude and prayed: “Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world. Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.”<a href="#14">[14]</a></p>
<p>I have observed the leaders of this Church pray, including members of the Twelve.&nbsp; I have heard and felt their great desire to be guided by the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; They always want to do the will of the Lord. These special witnesses of Christ, including the three new apostles sustained this past General Conference, have been chosen because of their belief in Him.&nbsp; In turn, those who believe in and act upon their words are given greater spiritual knowledge and guidance through the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost.<a href="#15">[15]&nbsp;</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s world there are many things that can distance us from the Spirit, that cause us to focus on the temporal, or encourage us to doubt. If you most desire the Holy Ghost, the decisions you make and the path you pursue will be markedly different. When you exercise faith in Christ, study the scriptures and the teachings of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles, and believe in and strive to follow their words, the Father will give unto you the Holy Ghost to assist you in doing so.&nbsp; May you truly receive and always desire to have the Holy Ghost to be with you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Desire to Know and Always Do the Will of God</span></p>
<p>In the <em>Lectures on Faith</em>, the third lecture describes three things that are necessary in order for any rational and intelligent being to exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.</p>
<p>“First, the idea that he actually exists.</p>
<p>Secondly, a correct idea of his character, perfections, and attributes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he [meaning each of us] is pursuing is according to his will.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an understanding of these three important things, our faith “can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness...”<a href="#16">[16]</a></p>
<p>From the First Vision, the Prophet Joseph Smith learned that God really exists and gained a correct understanding of some of His attributes. Joseph learned we are created in the image of God and that He knows us. Joseph also began to know the course he should pursue. Three years later, when he prayed to know of his “state and standing” before God, Joseph was visited by Moroni and told “that God had a work for [him] to do.”<a href="#17">[17]</a> As Joseph learned the course in life he should pursue, his faith became fruitful, and despite much opposition he abounded in righteousness as the prophet of the Restoration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Latter-day prophets we have a correct understanding of the existence and of the character and attributes of God. Through faith in our Father in Heaven and His Son, and with the guidance of the Holy Ghost, we can know if the course in life we are pursuing is pleasing in the sight of our Heavenly Father. As needed, the Holy Ghost will correct us and help us adjust our course. Such guidance may come for every aspect of our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you desire to know and do the will of God, and He sees you responding to the spiritual promptings He sends to you, more will come. In my life I have been blessed to have that happen on several important occasions. Two of them related to choices you may face regarding where to live and work so you can provide for your family and be of greatest service.</p>
<p>During my final year of law school, I was blessed to receive offers to work in three different states. Sister Funk and I wanted a good place to raise our family, a rewarding professional opportunity, and to be where we could do the most good.&nbsp; We prayerfully counseled together. We felt impressed to go to Denver, so I accepted the offer with the lowest starting salary. During the early part of my career, I was involved in land use matters and gained good experience working with very fine lawyers. With only three years of legal experience, I was called upon to serve as legal counsel for the Church in the purchase and zoning of the land for the newly announced Denver Temple. On a pro bono basis, I devoted a significant amount of time to that effort during the next year and later served on the open house and dedication committee. We felt grateful for the spiritual guidance that led us to Denver so we could have that very special opportunity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When our family was still young and growing, Sister Funk and I were looking for a larger home in another stake. In February of that year, we learned our bishop would be moving soon. We both received strong impressions that we should stay in our current ward, so we modified our search. In March, after returning from a vacation, we had decided to buy a new home under construction in our ward. As Sister Funk talked to the homebuilder on a Thursday morning, she learned the house we wanted had been sold while we were gone. She was very disappointed.&nbsp; That evening, I was called as the new bishop of our ward. The next day Sister Funk found the same model of house in a different neighborhood in our ward and we promptly bought it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year after we moved into our new home, our stake and ward were divided and the first house ended up in the other stake. Another year later, I was called as the stake president of the stake where we lived and served for ten years in that calling.&nbsp; Those opportunities may not have come if the Lord had not guided us to be where we could be of service.</p>
<p>As you pursue the opportunities that lie ahead of you, desire to know and seek to do the will of God. Prayerfully include Him in your decisions and then harken, which means to listen and obey, when the impressions of the Spirit come.&nbsp; It is wonderfully comforting when we know that the course we are pursuing is pleasing to our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple word of caution: we need to be moving forward in a good way for God to direct our steps. Sometimes a choice doesn’t matter; any of several good alternatives would be fine.&nbsp; Sometimes He leaves it to us to determine what is best.&nbsp; But on occasion, His direction and correction are necessary to avoid a mistake. If we desire His help and promptly respond when He offers it, we will not go astray.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Desire to become and be the means of doing much good</span></p>
<p>In April 1829, Oliver Cowdery began serving as scribe for the Prophet Joseph Smith in the translation of the Book of Mormon. At the time, Joseph was 23 years old.&nbsp; Oliver was 22 and a school teacher. They were the age and in the same stage of life as many of you. In response to a prayer for guidance by the Prophet and Oliver, they received the revelation contained in Section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Several times in this section, the Lord urges them to keep the commandments and to assist in the work, with the promise that they will be blessed.<a href="#18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Part of the direction they received seems especially helpful for you who come from developing countries and areas of the Church:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion;</p>
<p>Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich.&nbsp; Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.</p>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation.”<a href="#19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Joseph and Oliver were cautioned not to seek for riches but for eternal life. Then this counsel, “if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation.”<a href="#20">[20]&nbsp;</a> The same can apply to you. Successfulness in your career and becoming self-reliant are important, but also have a desire to be the means of doing much good in your generation.</p>
<p>Let me suggest two important ways for you to do much good:</p>
<p>First, be a good husband or wife and parent. Many cultures of the world today encourage postponing marriage and limiting the size of families, but one of the important reasons for coming to earth is to begin our eternal family.<a href="#21">[21]</a> Through the ordinances of the temple we can be married for all eternity and have children come to us who will be ours forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer became an apostle when I was still in high school so his teachings have greatly influenced my life. In his final General Conference message and testimony last April, he talked about two topics – first, Marriage and Family, and second, the Atonement. President Packer repeated a principle he frequently taught: “the end of all activity in the Church is to see that a man and a woman with their children are happy at home, sealed together for time and for all eternity.”<a href="#22">[22]</a>&nbsp; Referring to his wife, Sister Donna Packer, he said, “Toward the end of our mortal days together, I am grateful for each moment I am with her side by side and for the promise the Lord has given that there will be no end.”<a href="#23">[23]</a> I hope each of you desire a marriage that you can cherish throughout mortality and take back into the presence of God. If you are not yet married, or if your marriage does not resemble that exalting objective, desire that blessing in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forty years ago this month, knowing of my interest in becoming a lawyer, Sister Funk served me with a “Summons to Court” and our courtship began. A few months later, I pleaded guilty to being in love with her and asked if we could be bound together forever. She said yes and my life has been eternally better as a result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The president of the Church at the time we were married was President Spencer W. Kimball. He taught that we should not postpone marriage or children.&nbsp; We were married one week before I graduated from college and then we faced three years of law school together. A few days after my law school graduation, Sister Funk gave birth to our second child. Those early years were very hard financially, but we are grateful for our six children, their spouses, and now 13 grandchildren with whom we have been blessed.</p>
<p>When you measure your life near the end of your life, you will not reflect on the material things you have accumulated or the titles and positions you have held, but on your marriage and family.&nbsp; During my father’s life he had many titles, Doctor, Professor, Councilman, Commissioner, Bishop, President and others, but near the end of his life two years ago, nearly all of those who visited him called him Dad or Grandpa. The other titles had been given to others, but he was still a husband, father and grandfather who was dearly loved and appreciated by his family. Desire to be the means for doing good in your eternal role as a husband or wife and parent.</p>
<p>Second, be the means for doing good through service to God and others. Service is sanctifying. Service causes us to be less selfish; to focus less on our own problems and needs. Such service includes accepting and magnifying calls to serve in the Church. A call to serve usually does not come at a convenient time, and most always requires faith, effort and sacrifice. The result, however, is not only reflected in the good we do, but in how it changes us. We are blessed with increased knowledge, improved talents, and a more refined nature as we serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of a very busy third year of law school, I was called to serve as an elders quorum president. As I went home after accepting the call, I thought of my classwork, my responsibilities as an editor of the law review, my research fellowship that required additional work, and that I needed to devote much attention to finding good full-time employment for after graduation. I realized I was being stretched far beyond my capabilities. That night in my prayers I told Heavenly Father that I had accepted this calling, and that I would do my very best, but I greatly needed His help in every aspect of my life. I was blessed in every way, in completing my education successfully, finding a good job, and being guided in my service as the elders quorum president.&nbsp; Sister Funk, as she always has been, was a great support. It was a very formative time in my Church service, and I learned that the Lord truly does bless those who strive to serve Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many of the countries from which you come the Church is relatively new. Your talent and commitment are needed to continue the important work of establishing the Church there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not seek specific callings in the Church, but I have observed some who seem to avoid callings or limit their willingness or availability to serve. Every calling is important and each calling we receive deserves our best effort. At different seasons of our life, we may be called upon to devote more of our time and energy to service. Such opportunities should not be avoided, but received with humility and gratitude as the means of doing much good. The Church needs your devoted service and from your diligent, faithful efforts, in whatever calls may come, you will be blessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful for the refining experiences of Church service.&nbsp; In your pursuit of a successful career, which is a worthwhile objective, and the establishment of your family, I encourage you to also seek to “establish the cause of Zion.” <a href="#24">[24]</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, with the many opportunities in life that await you, strive to pursue a course that will bring joy and happiness now and throughout eternity. I invite you to reflect upon the real desires of your heart.&nbsp; What is it you ultimately want?&nbsp; If it is something other than eternal life, then that is likely what you will obtain. But with a gospel understanding of your eternal potential, I invite you to desire to always have the Holy Ghost to be with you.&nbsp; With that wonderful gift, your desire to know the will of the Lord and then do it can be fulfilled.&nbsp; With those two desires in your heart, you will naturally desire to be the means of doing much good, including in your family and in the Church.</p>
<p>I bear witness that our Heavenly Father and His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, love us. Their desire is to bless us with eternal life as we draw near unto Them and keep Their commandments. May we desire to do Their will and receive such blessings, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>September 22, 2015<br />Dan Kehoe<br />Bishop, YSA 9th ward, Laie Hawaii YSA 1st Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha Brothers and Sisters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I would like to offer a few remarks for you to ponder regarding developing selflessness through the gospel of Jesus Christ. This divine human attribute of selflessness is a wonderful characteristic that most if not all Christians hopefully strive to develop and become.</p>
<p>Selflessness is a quality which as Bishop Burke Peterson stated, “when it (selflessness) becomes part of our lives, it produces as an outgrowth in individuals who are happy in their relationships with others and at peace with themselves and those around them…..for whatever reason, who find a fuller and more abundant life. You see, there are those among us today who are completely selfless – as was he (Speaking of Jesus Christ).” <a href="#1">(1)</a></p>
<p>To help teach to you this concept let me offer a definition of the behavior of a selfless person with once again the assistance of Bishop Peterson. &nbsp;“A selfless person is a person who is more concerned about the happiness and well-being of another than about his or her own convenience or comfort.&nbsp; A selfless person is one who is willing to serve another when it is neither sought for nor appreciated, or one who is willing to serve even those whom he or she dislikes.&nbsp; A selfless person displays a willingness to sacrifice, a willingness to purge from his or their mind and heart personal wants, and needs, and feelings.” <a href="#1">(1)</a></p>
<p>Instead of reaching for and requiring praise and recognition for oneself, or gratification of his or her own wants, the selfless person will meet these very human needs for others. Let me note here that the secular ‘Humanist’ movement throughout the world is often critical of Christians regarding this principle stating that Christians often offer kind behavior so that they can receive religious and spiritual rewards. The truest form of selflessness does not need or is not predicated with reward or recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selfless behavior, as taught by our Savior, is to provide loving Christian actions without any desire for recognition of reward or praise for the provider. This is taught by our Lord Jesus Christ often in the New Testament, as Jesus blessed and healed numerous individuals and then asked that the rescued individual tell no one of the Lord’s actions. This understanding of not seeking recognition was highlighted in the Master’s teaching to his disciples found in Mark 10:42-45, “But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, …whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for man.” <a href="#2">(2)</a></p>
<p>To illustrate further this lack of attention to the Master and his selflessness, let me read from Philippians 2:5-11 of the New Testament provided by Paul the Apostle. “Let this mind (And I suggest this mind set in part is humility and selflessness) be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Where God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” <a href="#3">(3)</a> We should learn from our Savior that even he our Master gave up personal position in order to serve others. Under the greatest sufferings Jesus Christ was selfless in order to bring about the Atonement to mankind. He represents our greatest example of selflessness.</p>
<p>The most selfless of all service in the heavens or upon earth was offered as Christ, the “Beloved Son, which was … Beloved and Chosen from the beginning,” when he came before Father and said, “Thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.” Moses 4:2 <a href="#4">(4)</a></p>
<p>Now that we have emphasized this wonderful divine attribute of selflessness with definition let me suggest to you in our development of this principle how we as Christians can further develop this behavior in ourselves. First let us look at how great spiritual leaders have promoted this characteristic.</p>
<p>Often our development of selflessness calls for a commitment of our wisdom and temperance. King Benjamin of the Book of Mormon understood this concept when he spoke: “I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked , visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.”&nbsp;&nbsp; “And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength.”&nbsp; Mosiah 4:26-27 <a href="#5">(5)</a></p>
<p>President Kimball stated in an address to women:&nbsp;“Selflessness is a key to happiness and effectiveness;it is precious and must be preserved as a virtue which guarantees so many other virtues. There are so many things in the world which reinforce our natural <strong>selfishness,</strong> and neither our men nor women should be partakers thereof. We have grown strong as a people because our mothers and our women have been so selfless. That ennobling quality must not be lost, even though some of the people of the world may try to persuade otherwise….Let us be conscious of doctrines which preach unity but end up dividing.&nbsp; We hope our women as well as our men will be conscious of the philosophies of the world which would attempt to reverse the wisdom of the Lord when he tells us that “we can find ourselves only by losing ourselves.” Ensign, Nov. 1978, pp. 103-4 <a href="#6">(6)</a></p>
<p>Another leader in our church Sister JoAnn Jolley offers this helpful advice, “Offering compassionate selfless service does not imply spreading ourselves so thin that all of our relationships become weaker. Husbands, wives, parents, immediate families and some of our own needs should receive high priority.&nbsp; Each individual must than determine how far he can effectively extend himself beyond these circles while still maintaining order in his or her life and charity in his or her heart. We can hardly comfort all of humanity at once; but those to whom we do extend our love and concern are entitled to our deepest and most abiding compassion. Once our commitment is made, timing is essential. A person in need cannot wait to be comforted. His time is today: His pain is now; His loneliness is immediate.”&nbsp; <a href="#7">(7)&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Sister Jolley added, “There are moments when in compassion a touch is dear.” She relates, “I treasure memories of hands that held mine tight against pain, safe against fear, steady in the face of changing fortunes and troubled dreams. Hands often speak as voices cannot. They are a delicate comfort and cannot be forced upon the receiver, but when warmly offered and gratefully accepted, they import a tangible emotional help and strength.&nbsp; Hands bless, ordain, and heal. How appropriate, then that we employ them as instruments of compassion.” <a href="#7">(7)</a></p>
<p>Now that we have touched upon the great teachings of our Master and a few inspirational church leaders regarding the development of selflessness, let us move to how selflessness can improve in our families here at Brigham Young University Hawaii and in your future growth. Please you married couples pay attention to these thoughts on selflessness in a marriage and family life.</p>
<p>In preparing a talk, Gary Gray, a high councilor in the Santa Maria California Stake, relates the following information from his lovely wife regarding selflessness and serving one another. He wrote of his inquiry of his wife, “So tell me, what does a wife need the most?”&nbsp; His wife answered, “A wife needs someone who’s willing to help her do the things that she does for everyone else in the family.&nbsp; She needs an uncomplaining, good-natured helper who can keep focused on cleaning, cooking, shopping, child rearing, and organization…someone willing to do these things even if deserved recognition and praise do not always come.” <a href="#8">(8)</a>&nbsp;I believe she is talking in part about receiving selfless support from her eternal mate.</p>
<p>Brother Gray responded. “What about the priesthood? Isn’t it important to a wife that her husband holds the priesthood?” His wife kindly responded, “Yes, it means a great deal to me. But what’s important is using the priesthood, not just holding it. A priesthood holder should look for ways to use his priesthood to bless his wife.&nbsp; When a wife has to ask for help and service, she wonders if her husband is really aware of her needs.&nbsp; When a husband is sensitive to his wife’s needs, emotions, and daily trials, she feels valued and appreciated.” <a href="#8">(8)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Gray went on to state: “Just two more things, first, he should listen to her.&nbsp; She shouldn’t have to compete with the television or the newspaper or other distractions. He should listen with his heart to what his eternal companion has to tell him.&nbsp; If we’re going to spend eternity with each other we ought to know each other’s thoughts, opinions, worries, frustrations, and hopes.”&nbsp; She went on, “And second, he should simply love her.&nbsp; He should love her when she is impatient and frustrated after a busy day, or when she burns his dinner, or when she has trouble loving herself, or when she is four and a half months pregnant and doubts her ability to meet the needs of another child.&nbsp; And he should love her when she asks if they can eat out after a long day.” <a href="#8">(8)</a></p>
<p>The Grays went out to dinner that evening.&nbsp; Brother Gray later gave his talk and concluded by stating “true marriage” as President Kimball said, is based on a happiness that “comes from giving, serving, sharing, sacrificing and selflessness.” From Marriage and Divorce – Deseret Book Co., 1976, p. 12 <a href="#9">(9)</a></p>
<p>A mother serves selflessly by giving birth to a child and ideally continues her selfless service throughout the child’s life.&nbsp; For life to continue, the process must repeat itself. When one is serving, another is being served. Faith, love of God as well as fellowman, and self-esteem all depend on how we practice serving and being served. Perhaps this principle is best defined as selflessness – the giving of oneself both in serving others and in being served by others.</p>
<p>From personal experience let me add that my observations of women who are great mothers practice selflessness perhaps almost every moment of their existence. There is evidence that women/mothers may even have higher reticular activation systems in their brains to respond to their offspring more immediately. I have watched some of the greatest acts of selflessness in mothers throughout my life often in the most unassuming and non-recognizable situations. My own dear bride and mother of four has amazed me my whole life with what seems like a selfless never ending vigilance of love and concern for our children, now all grown. Our three daughter’s manifest a most nurturing and loving concern for their children. I am sure this love and concern is in large part to the wonderful selfless mother they model and enjoy every day. Forgive me Carol as I know you would not like this acknowledgement publicly.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the many members in this room that are not married yet and want to develop their potential to be selfless in their personality. Brothers and Sisters, in my profession, throughout my career and now once again in my cherished role here on this wonderful campus, I have been asked for many years what behavior to look for in a potential mate for a successful eternal marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many outstanding traits to look for in a potential mate for an eternal marriage. I could easily spend many devotionals with you on this subject. Let me focus on one of these most prized attributes. Let me suggest to you that being selfless or at least a sincere desire to develop selflessness is one of the most important characteristics you will ever find in a mate for an eternal marriage.&nbsp; This means finding a partner as we have been talking about who is selfless above his or her own needs.&nbsp; This means finding a partner who will always place his or her needs secondary to you and your children.&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; Yes it is possible and warrants finding a partner who is faithful to God, his or her love to you and dedicated to selflessness in service, especially to you. If both individuals have this selfless behavior toward each other than neither one in the marriage is troubled about not receiving their share of attention.</p>
<p>To illustrate how to help recognize selflessness in members of the church let us view this outstanding video entitled “Lift.”&nbsp; I believe you will all see and listen to the development of the true meaning of selflessness in ordinary men in the church who become extraordinary and develop a higher behavior of selflessness. I might note that I am sure that none of these men thought their acts of selflessness would turn into a church video.</p>
<p><strong>[video]</strong> <a href="#10">(10)</a></p>
<p>Thank you for watching this spiritually uplifting video.&nbsp; You might think this type of service viewed in the video is unique and perhaps rare. Certainly the content of the story is in tune with developing selflessness but I want you to know that I am aware of a very similar project that recently occurred in Kahuku just down the highway five miles from here.</p>
<p>All of you are capable of developing extraordinary acts of selflessness every day. All of us have opportunities daily to make others better with kindness and in turn find happiness.&nbsp; We all must recognize the daily enticements of worldly pleasures that may divert us from the path of happiness.&nbsp; However, the path to true and lasting happiness is, repeating the Prophet Joseph Smith’s words, “virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.” Joseph Smith Teachings p. 255-56 <a href="#11">(11)</a> Adding to this theme Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Rectitude is a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy but by serenity, which is joy fixed or habitual.” “Character,” Essay: Second Series 1844<a href="#12"> (12)</a></p>
<p>On a personal note let me share with you an experience in which I witnessed selflessness that brought tears to my eyes and helps prove my point of finding the greatest personal serenity through a selfless service to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A while ago I was involved in a voluntary mental health project to take care of the hungry, the less clothed, the sick, and to address the spiritual and temporal needs of homeless people on the leeward side of this island. We were to walk the beach and bush areas in the Waianae area and seek out individuals that were homeless. In my assignment I met many troubled individuals but none more memorable than a small middle aged Hawaiian woman living in the bush and tree area next to the Waianae Boat Yard. This area is a well- known homeless site here on Oahu. I was introduced to this sweet troubled woman by another woman that I will refer to as Ruth (This is not her real name). She would not want me to draw attention to her by using her real name. Ruth, who I grew to admire and care a great deal about that week, was a woman who once was a Catholic nun but had left the nunnery to work more directly with the under privileged citizens of Oahu. Ruth was a perfect example of living a life of contentment. Everywhere we went that week everyone knew her and I can say seemed to love her. I could almost immediately understand why she was so loved. She was heavenly. She was far from financially wealthy. She seemed happy and was very interesting to talk with. We talked a lot about religion those days and nights. Ruth was saintly in my opinion. She was selfless in her service.</p>
<p>My experience with this small troubled Hawaiian woman that Ruth took me to would probably not have happened without Ruth’s guidance. Ruth led me one night through literal darkness and bush to reach this poor woman. This dark journey could not have been more symbolic to me. Ruth and I learned from this troubled Hawaiian woman that she had been homeless for the last two years. She did have a tent that I stood by with my flashlight in the dark of the evening, but she commented to me where not to sit down because of the stinging spiders. This spider spot was approximately eight feet from her tent lodging. She shared information with us because we were interviewing her for placement into more suitable housing and care. In our medical interview she reported that she had been raped and had become HIV infected from the rape. Because of her confirmed HIV infection she was turned away from several housing opportunities. She was most gracious and loving in a grandmother type manner to Ruth and myself. We established this woman eligible for suitable housing and I am sure for more nourishment with food and clothing. I don’t believe I will ever be more humbled and certainly more blessed than I was trying to serve this sickly woman. I don’t know how selfless I was during this experience but I do know the spirit was with me at a very high level. I could not have been more fulfilled after that evening assisting this poor woman.</p>
<p>As I hope we strive to develop selflessness in our lives please remember it is unfortunately common to find ways to excuse ourselves with unjustified excuses not to serve. Bishop Burke Peterson stated: “Being selfless does not come naturally to most of us. Often it is easier to say, “I can’t,” or “I’m made differently,” or “I don’t have time,” than it is to become involved in making life happier and more pleasant for others.”&nbsp; <a href="#1">(1)</a></p>
<p>In closing let me read to you from Matthew 25: 34, 37-40. <a href="#13">(13)</a></p>
<p>“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world….</p>
<p>“Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and thee drink?</p>
<p>“When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p>“Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p>“And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”</p>
<p>Selflessness is a beautifully expressive word. It is a divine word expressing a divine pattern of living. I pray we all seek this attribute and manifest it to others as we develop our lives.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to my words today. I pray these words and thoughts will influence you in your development toward Selflessness.</p>
<p>I say these words in my Saviors name Jesus Christ my Master, Amen.</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, aloha! It is my pleasure this morning to share with you two stories of miracles—miracles of the sort each of us needs from time to time in our lives. I’m going to ask you to help me with these stories. I will provide some narrative, you will provide some music. The words of the hymns we will sing will be displayed for you on the screen.</p>
<p>The summer of 1831 was a time of great promise for a young printer by the name of William Phelps. He had just arrived with his family in Kirtland, Ohio. Brother Phelps was born in 1792 in New Jersey. In the spring of 1830, he read an announcement indicating that the Book of Mormon was about to be released from the press. His interest in this book later led him to purchase a copy from Parley Pratt. It was the reading of this book that prompted him to move to Kirtland where he sought audience with the prophet and inquired as to his duty. On June 14, Joseph received a revelation from the Lord, recorded in Section 55 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>“Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant William . . . thou art called and chosen; and after thou hast been&nbsp;baptized&nbsp;by water, which if you do with an eye single to my glory, you shall have a remission of your sins and a reception of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of&nbsp;hands; and then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and&nbsp;remission&nbsp;of sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. And on whomsoever you shall&nbsp;lay&nbsp;your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the Holy Spirit.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/55.1-3?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 55:1-3)</a></p>
<p>The revelation also directed Brother Phelps to be ordained an Elder and to travel to Missouri to assist Oliver Cowdery with printing and writing books for children.</p>
<p>Brother Phelps had many significant opportunities to serve and his name is mentioned in four additional sections of the Doctrine and Covenants. One of the things for which he is best remembered is the fact that he composed or adapted the lyrics of fifteen of the hymns of our church, including the ones we will sing today. He helped print the 1835 copy of the Doctrine and Covenants, and he printed the first hymnal for the Church that same year.</p>
<p>One of the high points for the early saints came in March of 1836 with the dedication of the first temple of this dispensation in Kirtland. From the pen of Brother Phelps came the beloved words sung at the dedication service.</p>
<p>[Congregation sings: <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/the-spirit-of-god?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Spirit of God</a>, verse 1 with chorus]</p>
<p>Nearly two thousand years previous, hope shined brightly for another young man. He found great comfort and joy sitting at the feet of his new master. He had yielded to the invitation to set aside his fishing nets and follow the prophet from Nazareth. With his fellow Galileans, he walked the dusty trails. He visited the sick and sinful. He watched as miracle after miracle was wrought by Him who professed that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. The influence of the divine, through the office of the Holy Ghost, worked upon his soul. When Jesus inquired of the apostles regarding their beliefs, he blurted out with conviction and power, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">(Matthew 16:16)</a> And then, came the most sacred moment of all, when Peter ascended the mount with James and John to see the Lord transfigured in His glory and hear the voice of the Father himself proclaiming, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/17.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">(Matthew 17:5)</a></p>
<p>For William Phelps and the apostle Peter, these were days to be cherished. The future seemed bright and filled with testimony of the sacred promises from God himself. Certainly, it was a time of rejoicing.</p>
<p>[Congregation sings: <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/now-let-us-rejoice?lang=eng" target="_blank">Now Let Us Rejoice</a>, verse 1]</p>
<p>The time of rejoicing, however, was soon followed by a time of great trial. It was only thirty months after the glorious visitations from the Savior and other heavenly beings that Joseph Smith found himself imprisoned in the tiny jail at Liberty, Missouri. There he remained through the Christmas season of 1838, through the winter, and well into 1839. The pain and sorrow he suffered were expressed vehemently in letters to the saints. Many who stood beside him in the beginning of this dispensation and even shared in heavenly manifestations had apostatized and been excommunicated for one reason or another. Some of these dissenters testified against him during hearings in Richmond and facilitated his imprisonment.</p>
<p>Among these traitors was William Phelps.</p>
<p>The prophet felt alone and betrayed. Some of his communications displayed the anger and frustration that any of us would have surely also felt. He cried out from the depths of his soul:</p>
<p>“O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1-2?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:1-2</a>)</p>
<p>Things also turned very dark for the young apostle Peter as he sadly witnessed the events that culminated in the arrest, trial, and execution of his beloved Savior. It was Peter’s bleakest hour. Only the evening before, he had boldly declared: “Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/26.35?lang=eng#34" target="_blank">Matthew 26:35</a>). Jesus knew the man’s great potential, but he also knew his weakness. He replied firmly to Peter: “Verily, I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.” Peter was appalled. How could this be? Was he not one of the first disciples to be called? Did he not straightway leave his net and follow the Lord on the first invitation (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Matthew 4:20</a>)? Was he not there when Jesus taught in Capernaum and “… many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him, [when] Jesus [said] unto the twelve, Will ye also go away” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.66-67?lang=eng#65" target="_blank">John 6:66-67</a>)? Was it not Peter who answered “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.68-69?lang=eng#67" target="_blank">John 6:68-69</a>). Surely Peter would not be offended. And he protested again: “Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/26.35?lang=eng#34" target="_blank">Matthew 26:35</a>).</p>
<p>But we know the story. The fear of men and the frailties of the moment prevailed. Peter indeed denied the Lord, not once, but three times. “And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter . . . [and] Peter went out and wept bitterly” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.61-62?lang=eng#60" target="_blank">Luke 22:61-62</a>).</p>
<p>I think he might have wondered if all was lost. He had begun with such great potential. He had followed the Savior everywhere, embraced his teachings, and testified of him. He was there on the Mount of Transfiguration and heard the voice of God the Father declaring the divinity of Christ. He saw Moses and Elias as translated beings conferring keys related to the Priesthood. Yet in spite of all of this, he had denied his Lord and Master. And even now, Jesus had been condemned to the cross. What was to become of him? Was this the end of that which had begun with so much promise?</p>
<p>[Congregation sings: <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/redeemer-of-israel?lang=eng" target="_blank">Redeemer of Israel</a>, verse 3]</p>
<p>I imagine that Peter watched from a distance as the Master was flogged, mocked, and abused in every way. With blood trickling down his face from the cruel crown of thorns, and stumbling under the weight of the instrument of his own death, Jesus was led to Golgotha, the place of a skull. The night before had been spent in agony beyond that which we are able to comprehend. Throughout that night, he willingly suffered spiritually, physically, and emotionally to the point that he sweat great drops of blood. No one in all of human history had suffered more and deserved it less. Now he was lifted up upon a wooden cross, to which he had been hung by nails through his hands, wrists, and feet. The apostle John records…</p>
<p>“After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge . . . and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/19.28-30?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">John 19:28-30</a>).</p>
<p>[Congregation sings: <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/o-god-the-eternal-father?lang=eng" target="_blank">O God, The Eternal Fathe</a>r, verses 2, 4]</p>
<p>For me, those are three of the most comforting words ever recorded in scripture: “It is finished.” That pronouncement brought not only an end to the Savior's suffering, it soon brought an end to Peter’s tears, for on“…the first day of the week, very early in the morning, [Peter and John] came unto the sepulcher . . . and they found the stone rolled away . . . And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments . . . and . . . they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/24.1-6?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Luke 24:1-6</a>). “Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week . . . came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/20.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">John 20:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>Imagine Peter’s feelings now. Just three days before, it seemed that all was lost. But now, there was hope. As he gazed upon the risen Lord, as he touched the tokens in his hands, he came to know that the promise of the resurrection was true, that with sincere repentance there would be forgiveness, that the covenants of the Father were to be fulfilled. Now the scriptures made sense. Now, he understood. Now there was time. Peter went forth to take advantage of that time with a bright hope and with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It was not long after that when Jesus asked Peter not once, but three times, “Do you love me?” And with conviction the apostle answered “Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.” Then the reply, “feed my sheep” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/21.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">John 21:16</a>). And feed them, he did. Peter became a great leader. He became a great missionary. He taught with power and with the Holy Ghost. He healed the sick. He opened the door for the Gospel to be preached to all nations. And eighteen hundred years later, he returned, a resurrected being himself, with two companions, to restore to earth the Melchizedek Priesthood. His potential had been reached. And though there was a time of weakness, that time was now finished. Because of the hope of the atonement and the resurrection, weakness was replaced with strength, pride with humility, turmoil with peace, and sorrow with joy.</p>
<p>In like fashion, the blessing of the atonement came to Joseph Smith as he suffered in the dank dungeon of Liberty Jail. Once again, the veil became thin, and a voice from heaven spoke to this valiant, yet suffering servant. It was the voice of Him who spoke to Moses in the wilderness, where the bush burned and the ground was too sacred for shoe or sandal. It was the voice of the Holy One of Israel, the Lord of Heaven and Earth. It was the voice that spoke through the pains of Gethsemane “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done . . .” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42?lang=eng#41" target="_blank">Luke 22:42</a>). It was the voice of Him that beckoned to us on more than one occasion, “how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings . . .” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">3 Nephi 10:6</a>). It was the voice of mercy from the cross, “Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do . . .” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">Luke 23:34</a>). It was the voice that spoke through tears of happiness as He gazed upon the repentant Nephites, “and now behold, my joy is full . . .” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.20?lang=eng#19">3 Nephi 17:20</a>). He who had healed the sick, raised the dead unto life, and given sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf, now spoke words of comfort to his servant, Joseph, even words of comfort to us all:</p>
<p>“…Peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high…” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7-8?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>Not long after this revelation was received, the incarceration in Liberty Jail came to an end. It was finished. Joseph moved with the Saints to Nauvoo, and enjoyed a few years of peace before the fateful day of June 27, 1844. Most of those who had apostatized from the Church in Missouri remained distant from the saints and some contributed to the horror of Carthage. One brother, however, felt the influence of the Holy Spirit, prompting him to repentance, sore repentance. Through prayer and answers in a remarkable dream, he was motivated to take the necessary steps. Hoping humbly, even desperately, for just a little mercy, William W. Phelps wrote to the prophet from Dayton, Ohio. It was the 29<sup>th</sup> of June 1840:</p>
<p>“Brother Joseph: I am alive, and with the help of God, I mean to still live. I am as the prodigal son, though I never doubt or disbelieve the fulness of the Gospel… I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have passed . . . I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me . . . I ask forgiveness in the name of Jesus Christ of all the Saints . . . I will make all the satisfaction on every point that God or Saints can require. Amen. W. W. Phelps (HC 4:141-142).</p>
<p>William Phelps was in a dark place. More than anything, he wanted the darkness to end. Like Peter, he longed for a second chance. He wanted the terrible choice of the past to be finished.</p>
<p>[Congregation sings: <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/now-let-us-rejoice?lang=eng" target="_blank">Now Let Us Rejoice</a>, verse 3]</p>
<p>On July 22, less than a month after William Phelps had written his letter of repentance, the prophet Joseph responded with the following:</p>
<p>“Dear Brother Phelps: I must say that it is with no ordinary feelings I endeavor to write a few lines to you in answer of yours... Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal. Your letter was read to the Saints last Sunday, and an expression of their feeling was taken, when it was unanimously resolved that W. W. Phelps should be received into full fellowship. ‘Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, for friends at first, are friends again at last.’ Yours as ever, Joseph Smith Jun.” (HC 4:162-164).</p>
<p>William W. Phelps joined the Saints in Nauvoo. He became an ordinance worker in the Nauvoo temple. He traveled west with the Saints in 1849. Shortly thereafter, he served a mission for the Church. In 1872, he passed away in Salt Lake City, an active high priest.</p>
<p>These two stories detail suffering and sorrow brought on by poor choices. Peter and William suffered for their own choices. For Joseph Smith, the suffering seemed terribly unfair because it was the result of the choices of others. In each case, the suffering had an end through the power and influence of God and through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Those three precious words: “It is finished” meant everything to Peter, William, and the prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>And so it is for us. If we are suffering because of sin and bad choices, let us repent. Then let us trust in the Lord and put the past behind us. The Lord has extended an open invitation. “Behold,” said the Savior, “he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.” Note that He said that the repentant sinner <em>is</em> forgiven, not that he will be or may be, but that he <em>is </em>forgiven. Let us open our ears and our hearts to hear and feel the Savior’s tender reply, “It is finished.” Then let us move forward and allow it to be finished, not looking back, but looking forward with faith, hope, and confidence in God’s promises. This truly is the Gospel of second chances.</p>
<p>If we suffer from bitterness, disappointment, ailments, or hurt feelings, then let the atoning blood of the Savior bring a change in perspective and a healing of our hearts. Hear the words of the Savior as He bowed His head for the last time in mortality. Let it be finished.</p>
<p>We are assembled here together in the shadow of one other story of hope and healing. In 1836, a young lady by the name of Mary Fielding joined the Church in Toronto, Canada with her brother and sister. They moved to Kirtland in 1837 to join the Saints. Her life was one of continuous trial and lasting faith. She married the prophet’s brother, Hyrum, and raised his young children after his first wife died in childbirth. She survived heartache, persecution, terrible illness, and fear for her life and the lives of her children during the months of Liberty Jail and as she fled from Missouri to Nauvoo. She endured the shock of the vicious murder of her husband in Carthage Jail. She tolerated ridicule and hardship as she traveled west with the Saints to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, a trip that established a legacy of healing that would transcend and bless future generations. Even cattle were healed from the precipice of death by her faith in God and trust in the restored priesthood even though some who held that priesthood contributed to her difficulties. She did the best she could to raise a son she shared with Hyrum, but who experienced unspeakable horror at the tender age of five years old when his father left this mortal existence. It wasn’t many years after arriving in Salt Lake that she finally succumbed to prolonged illness. Mary was taken home to her dear husband and to the Savior who gave her hope. The sacrifices of her consecrated life were now finished.</p>
<p>Her son Joseph, still scarred from the death of his father, was now orphaned as a young teenager. His life needed healing as he battled the demons spawned by tragic circumstance. The healing came, but not quickly and not until he travelled thousands of miles away to this land where he served what would become the first of three missions to these islands. Part of the healing came through sincere dedication to the work of God. Part of it came from the humbling experience of loneliness, strange food and language, and intense physical hardship. Part of it came during an extended illness of his own when he was succored at the hands of a Hawaiian woman, Ma Manuhii, who brought again into his life the tenderness of a loving mother. Thus, this troubled lad through the refining effect of these trials and many others that would come during his life, through obedience, and through the power of the Atonement was transformed to eventually become a revered prophet of God.</p>
<p>The legacy of healing continued through him as he brought a great gift to a people likewise sacrificing to be faithful, but also troubled with great challenges. On June 1, 1915, the prophet Joseph F. Smith stood a short distance from here and declared that a temple would be built. The ground was dedicated immediately, and four years later, the first temple outside the United States was finished. A new chapter began, a second chance if you will, for a people who for more than sixty years had labored to build their faith and foundation in the restored Gospel. They too had sacrificed and worked to be obedient. They too had suffered persecution, even at the hands of some who should have considered themselves their brothers and sisters. Like the Saints in Kirtland and Missouri, they had endured the misery of conflict and apostasy among some of their own. But now with a temple, Laie, the place of gathering, had become a place of hope and of healing. I want you to know that that legacy continues, and it will change your life if you will let it.</p>
<p>I solemnly testify of the reality of Him who pronounced those sacred words, who declared to the prophet Joseph: “glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>Now, Brothers and Sisters, the story of William W. Phelps has one more piece on which we will end. His gratitude for a second chance was expressed in one more hymn, which he penned after the prophet's mortal ministry was ended and his sacrifice finished at the hand of the mob. We will now sing it together in closing before the benediction.</p>

<p>August 8, 2015<br />Patrick K. Kanekoa and Elizabeth P. Kanekoa<br />President and Matron, Laie Temple<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Sister Kanekoa:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Aloha.</p>
<p>At the sunrise of my life, I was raised as a faithful Catholic girl. I always knew of a certainty that there was a God, who loved me and that he was always with me, wherever I was. Then, in my senior year of high school, I met a young man, who on our first date asked me “what church do you belong to?” I thought that was a strange question, wasn’t everyone who was serious about church a Catholic?<em> </em>His reaction surprised me, when I told him that I was a Catholic. Then I asked him, “What church do you belong to?” He said that he is a Mormon. I have never heard of a Mormon or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints, at least he knew what a Catholic was! No matter, he would become a Catholic before we got married, and so will the two young men that he sent to my house to teach me. Well, he is sitting right there and here I am.</p>
<p>So how does one go from the sunrise to the sunset of their life with joy and assurance in their heart? It is very simple, brothers and sisters. It is through the principal of obedience, which is the first law of heaven, that we can and will obtain the sweet assurance in our hearts. President Spencer W. Kimball said, “we are blessed, as we show our faith in God, by being obedient to His will.” D&amp;C 130:21 – “And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.”</p>
<p>The scriptures teach us that Lehi was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him in 1 Nephi 2:3. But how about Nephi’s obedience when he told his father Lehi, who asked that he return to Jerusalem with his brothers for the brass plates, after failing the first time? This was not an easy task, because Nephi’s brothers were very unhappy with him, to put it mildly. But said Nephi to his father, “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” That is in 1 Nephi 3:7, which is my favorite scripture.</p>
<p>I bare witness to you; the Lord truly does prepare a way for each of us. My sweet grandmother put it another way. When I saw difficulties within the family, I would ask her “grandma, what’s going to happen? What are we to do?” Her response was always, “Elizabeth, the Lord will provide.” I testify that she was absolutely right. The Lord always did provide for our needs.</p>
<p>In the book entitled <em>Power to Become</em> by Elder Bednar, he teaches us that the first law of heaven is obedience, the aligning of our individual will with God’s will. Obedience operates at a number of different levels, and is not simply a passive, steady states. Rather, obedience grows, develops, deepens and increases and expands. Our experience with an understanding of the principal of obedience should change as we develop spiritually and as we gain additional light and knowledge, line upon line, precept upon precept. Also, our spiritual expectations should increase and intensify as we continue to faithfully obey God’s commandments.</p>
<p>Closely associated with obeying with a willing heart is reaching a point where we no longer are driven or directed by rules. Instead, we learnt to govern our lives by principals. To be sure, we keep the rules but we also begin to ask ourselves what is the principal involved here? Such a person becomes less dependent upon external scaffolding and structure and more dependent upon quiet and on going divine directions. As our Prophet Joseph explained, I teach them correct principals and they govern themselves. As life continues to swiftly passes by, it reminds me of a song that I love from “Fiddler on the Roof “ as the parents of the bride to be wed sing about how quickly life has passed them by. Tevye looks at his daughter and asks, “is that the little girl I carried?” And then mom reflects, “I don’t remember getting older. When did they?” And then the chorus, “Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset. Swiftly fly the years. One season following another, laden with happiness and tears.”</p>
<p>Most of you here are young, and have many things to accomplish in this life, that passes us so swiftly. I strongly urge and encourage you to remember these two principles, obedience and faith. If you are obedient, you will be honest in all of your dealings. When you are honest in all of your dealings, I know that you will have sweet peace in your life. When you look in the mirror, you will love that person looking back at you. Then, here is the bonus, as you build upon your obedience, you will be blessed with a strong foundation of faith. With obedience comes faith; faith is to hope for things which are not seen, but which are true, as we are told in Hebrews 11:1, and must be centered in Jesus Christ in order to produce salvation. To have faith, is to have confidence in something or someone. Yes, I have faith and confidence that God and His Son have always loved me and that they will always be with me. Even back then at the sunrise of my life, and now the in the sunset of my mortal life. I know that they are still with me, everyday of my life.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify to you that if you can obtain the sweet peace that obedience and faith will give to you in your life, I know of a surety that you will find the peace that you seek in this life. And I leave you this testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kanekoa:</p>
<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters Aloha,</p>
<p>Sister Kanekoa and I are honored to be here as our term as your Temple President and Matron draws to a close. We have learned many things and have had the guidance and direction of our Heavenly Father. We want to thank each of you for your love and support. Many of you serve in the temple and we see so many attending the temple. Thank you for being temple worthy.</p>
<p>We have been told throughout our lives that we are a covenant making people. From the beginning in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/6.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Genesis 6:18</a><em>—</em>“But with thee will I establish&nbsp;my&nbsp;covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.”<em>&nbsp; </em>Then in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/3.25?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">Acts 3:25</a><em>—</em>“Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers….”<em>&nbsp; </em>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:13</a>—“Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body....’ In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 1:22</a> we are told <em>—</em>“That mine everlasting covenant might be established;”&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a covenant?&nbsp; A covenant is an agreement between God and His children. It is not a contract! We do not act as equals in this agreement. God gives the conditions for the covenant and we agree to do what He asks us to do. God then promises us certain blessings for our obedience. When we make covenants we promise to obey them!</p>
<p>Many of us, especially those who are born and raised in the gospel do not realize that the first covenant that we make as a member of the church is our Baptismal covenant.&nbsp; When we are baptized we promise that we will follow Him and obey His commandments.&nbsp; Another covenant that we should keep is in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77?lang=eng#76" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:77</a><em>—</em>“…always remember Him…; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will give an example that we may be able to relate to more easily. One day you look at your very busy schedule – seminary, sports, school, church, band, debate team, dance and the list goes on. You tell your parents, I really could do better and have more time if I could have a car. They say yes but here are the conditions. You must clean your room, mow the yard, and be good to your little Brother and Sister and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You did not set the conditions to getting a car but you agreed to the conditions your parents set. You did not sign a contract. As time goes by you stop cleaning your room, mowing the yard and keeping the conditions of your agreement.&nbsp; One day you cannot find the keys to your car. Guess who has your keys?&nbsp; The privilege you had for the use of the car you were promised (blessing) were taken away. You did not fulfill your part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father loves each of us. Keep your covenants and you will be safe and happy. Break the covenants and you will have no promise. It is a mistake to assume that anything not specifically prohibited in the “letter of the law” is somehow approved by the Lord.&nbsp;“For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">D&amp;C 58:26.</a>)</p>
<p>“And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off…”<em> </em>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:5</a>)<em>&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>We are given enough to know what is right and to keep our covenants. Don’t get caught up in rationalizations.&nbsp; Be guided by the Holy Spirit and you will always keep the covenants that you make with Heavenly Father. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Alma 41:10</a>—the Prophet Alma simply states<em>—</em>“…Behold I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father told the Nephites, “…ye are the children of the covenant” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">3 Nephi 20:26</a>).&nbsp; And he described the restored gospel as the “new and . . . everlasting covenant.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/22.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 22:1</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith said, “I do not care what office you hold in the Church, you may be an apostle, you may be a patriarch, a high priest, or anything else, and you cannot receive the fullness of the priesthood unless you go into the temple of the Lord and receive those ordinances of which the prophet speaks. No man can get the fullness of the priesthood outside of the temple of the Lord.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then said, “…you cannot get these blessings on the mountaintops, you will have to go into the house of the Lord, and you cannot get the fullness of the priesthood unless you go there. Do not think that because anybody has a higher office in the church than you have, that you are barred from blessings, because you can go into the temple of the Lord and get all the blessings there are that have been revealed, if you are faithful, have them sealed upon you as an elder in this Church, and then you have all that any man can get.”</p>
<p>The temple is the only way back to our Heavenly Father. The ordinances and covenants received in the House of the Lord ultimately enable us, if we are faithful and endure to the end, to enter His presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.15-16?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">D&amp;C 97:15-16</a>)</p>
<p>In the temple we make 5 major covenants. Those 5 covenants along with the sacramental covenant are the most sacred of all covenants.&nbsp; President Gordon B. Hinckley said of these covenants – “If our people could only learn to live by these covenants, everything else would take care of itself. We would not have to worry about sacrament meeting attendance. We would not have to worry about willingness to serve missions. We would not have to worry about divorce and the many requests for cancellation of temple sealings.”</p>
<p>Please recognize and keep the 5 covenants that we make in the temple and don’t take lightly our sacramental covenant that we renew each week. We are not only a covenant making people but we are a blessed people. President Spencer W. Kimball has said that the most often sin we [unknowingly] commit as a member of the church is that of ingratitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we take time to recognize and appreciate our many blessings. We have been given everything. We are blessed with promises and knowledge that we have been given on earth; we have the keys and knowledge of eternal life and residing with Heavenly Father not only in the Celestial Kingdom &nbsp;but in the <em>highest degree</em> of the Celestial Kingdom. In addition we will have joy and happiness as we dwell in this earthly state and keep the sacred covenants.</p>
<p><em>“</em>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; And if he does not, he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.1-4?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 131:1-4</a>)</p>

<p>Looking, Trusting, and Walking with God</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, good morning, and aloha.</p>
<p>It’s a pleasure to be with you all today and I’m very honored to have been invited to speak. I love our devotionals! To me they feel like the campus’ equivalent of a family home evening. We get a lesson and we have the opportunity to intermingle and connect. I love them.</p>
<p>Just as our university ohana is a family, the scriptures clearly teach that we are all part of God’s family. We are his children. On this topic let me ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>What will it be like to return home to God? Have you thought about this lately? How will it feel? How will God respond when you return?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that God our Father will be just as excited to see you as you will be to see him. Can you imagine that? But what else would you expect from a perfect parent? Of course it will be that way. Think of how mortal parents feel when their children come home from missions.</p>
<p>Similarly, I believe the Savior will be thrilled to be with you again! Isn’t that an exciting thought? But what else would you expect from a perfect brother, especially of the one who has atoned for all the injustices and sins of your life? How can your homecoming be anything other than a glorious moment of shared victory?</p>
<p>Lastly, how will it feel to get there and then turn around and watch others have the same experience? Will you be part of the thrilled welcoming party, or will you be a less enthused spectator wondering how God could possibly be so excited to see so-and-so?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This begs the question: How do you feel about your eternal siblings now? Certainly, none of us feels the same degree of love for them as God and Christ do. Where are we today? To what degree do you joy to be with your spiritual brothers and sisters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest to you that unhealthy social comparison is one of the primary obstacles to feeling love for others. My purpose today is to provide some metaphors, scriptures and thought patterns designed to enable you and me to more easily overcome this obstacle through our faith in Christ, and thus be more able to be filled with charity.</p>
<p>Allow me to start with a story.</p>
<p>Imagine with me the following story. Two brothers, Pete and Sam, go camping with their family at Zions National Park in southern Utah. They set up camp at the bottom of a very tall cliff with plans to go hiking throughout the next day. The next morning, these two brothers sleep in while their parents go on an early morning warm-up hike up to Angel’s Landing, a hike too dangerous for the young boys. After a while the boys wake up and start entertaining themselves around camp as they wait for their mom and dad to return. Both find some sharp rocks that they think are cool, and they start using them to make drawings on the base of the cliff wall. They're just having fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the younger brother, Sam, gets the idea to see how high of a mark he can make on the cliff. He jumps up and scratches the wall at about six feet high. Pete thinks this looks fun and he does the same, scratching the wall a few inches higher than Sam. Wishing not to be outdone, Sam tries again, with a running start this time, and marks the wall an inch higher than Pete. "Ha!", he boasts to Pete. Well, Pete now gives it his all, and wouldn't you know it, gets even higher, out-marking Sam's second height by another marginal degree. From their vantage point, looking up, his mark is by far the closest to the top of the cliff. Pete is number 1, and he flaunts it to his brother, while Sam feels frustrated that he can never quite seem to measure up.</p>
<p>Now, further imagine, at the very time that Pete and Sam wake up, the boys' parents have just reached the summit of their hike, hundreds of feet above the valley floor. Just before the boys begin their drawings on the cliff wall their dad pulls out the family binoculars to look down at the camp to see what his sons are up to. He's able to see the boys, and he watches them jumping and making their "high" marks. First he laughs, but then he pities them. He feels sorry for Sam, and he feels sorry for Pete, too, because as he pulls away the binoculars he sees the full size of the cliff and wonders how it could be that either of his sons think that they have reached any height worth bragging about, or any difference in skill levels worth feeling ashamed of. Their marks are both at the very bottom of the cliff, and from his vantage point the two marks seem to be at the exact same height.</p>
<p>Problem Statement and Contrast of Mindsets</p>
<p>I tell this story because it illustrates in an elementary way the following very serious issue: when we compare ourselves to others we simply do not see ourselves the way God sees us. From the top of the cliff, he looks down on us and sees us all, equally, as little children.</p>
<p>We can avoid this tendency to compare ourselves with others by looking upward to God and considering our relation to him rather than our status among peers. In a parable, Jesus provided an example of how to do this:</p>
<p>[video]</p>
<p>Whose marks were higher on this cliff wall? The Pharisee's, right? He had the social status and seemed to have his life well organized. But God was more pleased with the humble publican.</p>
<p>Although likely just a cast member in a hypothetical parable, this publican is indeed a good example. I think of him as being familiar with Abraham chapter 3:19. There the Lord gives Abraham some helpful instruction before Abraham's move into Egypt. He reveals: "These two facts do exist, that there shall be two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike both Pete and Sam in our original story, and unlike the Pharisee, the publican isn't concerned about being either number one or number two in the peer comparison game. His eyes are focused on number three, and in relation to Him, the publican is able to keep the correct, complete perspective: he is the sinner, he must repent, and he can do all things through Christ. He’s going to make it!</p>
<p>While the Pharisee likely assesses people's worth by their ability and status, the publican is motivated by Elder Neal A. Maxwell's teaching: "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability!"</p>
<p>The Pharisee sees life as a competition. The publican sees life as a journey and as an opportunity to serve. The Pharisee sees mankind as competitors. The publican sees others as spiritual siblings, of equal potential and capacity, people to learn with and learn from. The Pharisee lives in the finite, bottom-of-the-cliff world of scarcity, and places high value on things that are in scarce supply, like wealth, attention and leadership positions. The publican looks up and sees the top-of-the-cliff world of abundance, and places high value on celestial things that are in infinite supply, like love, family and leadership qualities.</p>
<p>If pressed, the Pharisee might eventually confess that he believes that God is merely a fiction, that mankind is a bother, and that his mission in life is to succeed in his career.</p>
<p>The publican, on the other hand, might summarize his worldview alongside President Monson: "God is a father. Man is brother. Life is a mission, and not a career."</p>
<p>This is the secret of the "penitent and truly humble seeker(s) of happiness," whenever they have lived. When they perceive some of the inevitable discrepancies between themselves and others, they look beyond the scratch marks and "remember the Third." They look to God and live.</p>
<p>And so looking to God is the first of three steps I will speak about today that can be followed to overcome social comparison and be filled with more natural love for one another. The following two will be trusting exclusively in God's assessment of your worth, and walking humbly with God in service to your fellow man. So the three steps are looking, trusting and walking.</p>
<p><strong>Look</strong></p>
<p>Brother Tad R. Callister has taught that "with increased vision comes increased motivation." That motivation can often take the form of confidence and moral courage. In Acts 7:55 we read that Stephen "looked steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God." Even while Stephen's detractors "gnashed their teeth upon him" he had the courage to declare his vision: "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God." For this his enemies dragged him out of town and began stoning him, and even while they were in the act of stoning him, Stephen loved them, crying out "with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge."</p>
<p>Like Stephen, when we look up, steadfastly, unto Christ we can act with love, even in hard circumstances.</p>
<p>But the veil imposes an interesting challenge in this regard. The fact is we do not see God with our natural senses in our day-to-day activities. It is natural for all of us to focus on what is immediately around us. It can be hard to maintain a perspective which is greater than the one developed by your senses. Here’s an example of how we've all experienced this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose you're standing at the base of a very tall building, like New York City's Empire State Building here shown. Are you tall or are you small? You certainly feel a little smaller than usual, what with this huge building beside you, but you still don't correctly perceive just how small you are. The people around you are still just as big as ever, and although you can tell the building is tall, you can't really appreciate just how tall it is. As you look up, looking towards the 102nd floor, the 30th floor looks like its about half way up. You visually ascribe too much credit to what is more proximate to you.</p>
<p>Even as you move down the street, the height of the skyscraper relative to the other buildings is hard to fully appreciate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't until you get up off the street or far away from the building that you can appreciate more perfectly just how tall the building is, and just how relatively small the people standing at its base truly are.</p>
<p>Our spiritual discernment can suffer from the same effect, and in looking to God as a means of escaping the effects of social comparison, we risk making two compounding mistakes: one, we underestimate the grandeur of God and two, we overvalue the assessments of us from those around us.</p>
<p>So what can be done to get us up off the street so we can get the full view of God and of ourselves? In the terms of our first analogy, what "hiking" activities help elevate our vision and help us feel the joy of escaping comparison?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally for you, what activities help you focus upon the Savior? Think of the books you read, the movies you watch, the music you listen to. Think of the places you worship, the amount of time you dedicate to pondering, the amount of service you provide. What activities help you to look steadfastly upon Christ? Conversely, which activities have the effect of distracting your focus?</p>
<p>I invite you this week to identify a distraction in your life that takes your gaze away from the Savior. Identify just one. It doesn't have to be a big thing, although it may be. Identify that distraction and replace it with an activity that focuses your attention on Jesus in some way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you and I look steadfastly to Christ, our minds will be filled with truth.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
<p>Having our gaze set steadfastly upon the Savior, we are now ready for step two of our quest to be filled with brotherly love. Step two is about trusting exclusively in the Savior's assessment of our state and standing before him. What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>To a greater or lesser extent, we all need affirmation. Progression and improvement are our goals, and we need indicators to help us know whether and how well we are progressing. The natural way to achieve this is to compare ourselves to others and to seek counsel from trusted friends. Seeking counsel from those who love the Lord in their lives is very wise, but ultimately we must receive our own revelation. And comparing ourselves with others is very dangerous, as we’ve already seen in the example of the Pharisee. So what is a better way?</p>
<p>The best way was modeled by the prophet Joseph Smith. When he was 17 years old he was trying to understand his place in the world just like all the rest of us are prone to do. He wasn't sure whether he was progressing according to plan.</p>
<p>Rather than look to his peers for either a benchmark or for justification he turned to God. He later recounted it in these terms: "I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections;" so "I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him."</p>
<p>Joseph Smith sought to understand his "state and standing before (God)," rather than his status among men. It was God's assessment, God's affirmation that mattered to him. Assessments of Joseph Smith's character came and have continued to come from all sorts of people. He didn't listen to those voices, and neither should you and I, neither about him, nor about us. God's opinion should be our sole concern. As we choose to make it our only concern, we will be blessed with a humbled sense of belonging, and our hearts will fill with love.</p>
<p>This second step is all about trust. Intimately, down deep, what voices do you trust? What indicators do you rely on to help you perceive whether you're progressing according to your potential? Let's consider some good and bad examples from the scriptures.</p>
<p>You'll remember the account of the rich young ruler, the man who finds Jesus and asks him two great questions, "Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life," and "what I lack I yet?"--two fantastic questions when posed sincerely. Jesus gives him an answer which he has a hard time trusting. But before I address that, quickly notice Jesus' response to being called "Good Master." He says, "why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is, God." Jesus was modeling these steps: he had his eyes focused on his Father, standing at the top of the cliff! He was doing both step 1--looking steadfastly--and now we see him keeping step 2--he didn't care much for his peer's flattery!</p>
<p>Now back to the rich young ruler. You'll remember the Savior asks him to sell all that he has and give the proceeds to the poor, and come and follow him. In response to this the young man goes away sorrowing, and Jesus says, "how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!... With men that trust in riches it is impossible; but not impossible with men who trust in God and leave all for my sake, for with such all these things are possible."</p>
<p>What's the lesson? I don't think the young man was worried about being able to survive. His decision to not part with his means was likely not a life or death decision, seeing as the disciples apparently had enough money for their needs. His trust in riches likely wasn't about his ability to have the tangibles needed to sustain life, although that may have been there to some extent. I suppose that he was concerned more about the intangibles that parting with his wealth would require him to forego: his status among his peers, his social position, his access to certain social circles, and perhaps even his job and his associated title and related privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the rich young man's tragic example we learn that, in our effort assess our state and standing before God, we must not trust any form of status. We should have a cautious distrust of any indicators of success that can measured, for as President Uchtdorf recently reminded us, "many of the things you can count, do not count. Many of the things you cannot count, really do count."&nbsp;</p>
<p>So trust in God's personal assessment of you. That's what really counts!</p>
<p>Peter is our next example. After the rich young man walks away and the Savior provides his comment about the rich your man's misdirected trust, the record says "Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee." At that point, the Savior seemingly cuts him short, interrupts him, and corrects him for beginning to make the exact same mistake the rich young man just did: trusting in a peer-based comparison! Peter's statement seems to me to be inherently comparative, as if he is implying, "we have been obedient, as opposed to that guy..." and Christ won't allow for his disciples to assess their state and standing before God based upon anything other than absolute--as opposed to relative, or comparative--truth.</p>
<p>The Joseph Smith Translation of Mark 10:31 makes it clear that the Savior perceived Peter to be putting himself above the rich young man. While the standard text reads “But many that are first shall be last; and the last first,” the inspired revision states, "But there are many who make themselves first, that shall be last, and the last first. This he said, rebuking Peter."</p>
<p>So we must eliminate all reliance upon laterally discerned indicators of progression, even those involving our apparent relative righteousness. Having begun by looking steadfastly towards heaven, we must be sure that we keep our focus there and trust exclusively the assessment of our state and standing before God which comes from God.</p>
<p>David wrote: "Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God."</p>
<p>Paul said: "With me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment:... he that judgeth me is the Lord."</p>
<p>We should join these righteous men: "trust in the Lord with all (our) heart, and lean not unto (our) own understanding… Be not wise in thine own eyes."</p>
<p><strong>Walk</strong></p>
<p>Now for step three, walking humbly with God in service to our fellow man.</p>
<p>I can remember a time period in my teenage life, when 14 and 15 years old that I had the thought, "I'm now the age that Joseph Smith was when he received the First Vision. I wonder if, as I pray in faith, I might be visited by angels, too." I prayed each morning and night in my bedroom closet -- taking the Sermon on the Mount admonition literally -- and sometimes I would peak my eyes open to see if I was still alone. I really thought it would be amazing to be visited by an angel; I still do, but during that time I thought about it and hoped for it often. It never happened, and I have to admit that, although I was content with the Lord's will, I was a little disappointed.</p>
<p>During that generally same timeframe, I went on splits with the missionaries for my first time. I will never forget this experience. We taught an investigator what was then called the 4th Discussion, on the Plan of Salvation. I remember joining in to help explain and to testify about what I believed to be true. I remember rejoicing and being edified together along with this earnest investigator hearing these truths for her first time. With her, I remember feeling absolutely filled with joy. Her face said it all! After the appointment, as we walked to the street corner where my mother was to pick me up at an appointed time, I remember thinking, "I hope she's running late! I don't want this to end!"</p>
<p>Since then I've served as a home teacher, a missionary, a friend, and in many other callings in the church through which I've begun to formulate an idea. There could be at least the following two reasons why God didn't send an angel to visit me as a youth. The first one you may already be guessing: he had already given me an angel father and an angel mother, both of whom love the Lord and who regularly taught me from the same scriptures that a visiting angel would quote from; the Lord had provided me a patriarchal blessing through an inspired stake patriarch; and provided countless others, including righteous siblings, seminary teachers, Sunday School teachers, quorum presidents and advisors, and friends. I was constantly surrounded by inspired messengers.</p>
<p>The second reason could be that God had something better in store for me -- something better in store for each one of us -- than to only receive. I ask you, which do you consider greater, to receive a temporary visit from an angel, or to be able to regularly minister as and speak with the tongue of an angel yourself? Which is more lastingly transformative? In terms of my experience, I can honestly say that being with the missionaries that day, teaching the plan of salvation to that earnest investigator was at least as impactful as an angelic visit would have been, if not more so. I got to be an angel, not just see one!</p>
<p>And through the restoration of God's authority on earth this opportunity is available for all!</p>
<p>"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; ... that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world."</p>
<p>In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ours is a many-to-many ministry. It scales perfectly. As home teachers and visiting teachers, everyone has at least someone to minister to, under delegated direction from their bishop. By the authority associated with the priesthood keys he holds, in this capacity, as well as in the capacities of our callings, we have access to more than our natural abilities and our previously acquired personal knowledge. We have wisdom beyond our own. We can teach as one having authority, and not as the scribes. That is the miracle and the message of this restored church. This is the sense in which it is verily a true and living church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In following steps 1 and 2 -- looking to God and trusting in his love -- we are drawn nearer to God. As we feast upon the words of Christ we can speak with a new tongue, even the tongue of angels, as Nephi says. We become as angels, and this is how we walk with God: our third step.</p>
<p>Walking with God suggests staying with him, going where he would go, doing what he would do, saying what he would say, aligning with his priorities, joining his church, sustaining his apostles, and bringing others along with us for the walk. These things function to help us maintain the feeling of brotherly love we long for.</p>
<p>In war and sports we say: "the best defense is a good offense." This applies to spirituality as well. If you would like to have fewer feelings of either worthlessness or vanity, if you would like to feel more love for yourself and for others, then choose to go on offense. If you are burdened by a constant temptation or a vexing addiction, then find ways to serve your fellow men, and you will not have to concern yourself as much with trying to guard against sin or shortsightedness. Service keeps our hearts and minds close to God, and we are thus naturally less susceptible to uninspired influences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If sharing your faith with others feels awkward or scary, here's a suggestion. While loving almost always involves listening, teaching doesn't always require talking. When in doubt, ask and listen. Don't let not knowing exactly what to say keep you from sharing your faith. Focus on loving, and the words and the wisdom as to how and when to share them will come.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On Motive</strong></p>
<p>Now a quick word on motive: As you and I seek to lift others, we must constantly remember to focus on building God's kingdom, and not our own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This university's friend Paul Wilson once wisely commented on how fleeting and purposeless it is to build up one's own kingdom. He likened such kingdoms--or you could say careers--to the ornate sandcastles that he would carefully build on the beach when out for evening walks with his family. No matter how large or how fancy he made the castle, the results were always the same. The next day upon returning he would find absolutely no remaining trace of his work. The waves of time had washed it all away, completely.</p>
<p>When we do what is right for the wrong reasons not only do our efforts contribute to something unenduring, but we also miss out on the added strength to overcome social comparison that we've been talking about today. The Pharisee from our video did many good things, too, you'll remember. So while we serve, we remember to circle back to step one, to look steadfastly to God, and remember always our own unworthiness and nothingness before God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his greatest rebuke of the Pharisees, the Savior provided this counsel to his disciples, that we can remember when our service brings us titles and attention:</p>
<p>But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</p>
<p>And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,&nbsp;</p>
<p>And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi, which is Master.</p>
<p>But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.</p>
<p>What I've provided this morning in these three steps is really just an elaboration on the following counsel from President Monson. In a couple of talks he's counseled us:</p>
<p>Fill your mind with truth</p>
<p>Fill your heart with love</p>
<p>Fill your life with service</p>
<p>Our minds fill with truth as we look steadfastly unto God. Our hearts fill with love as we &nbsp;trust exclusively in his assessment of us. And our lives fill with service as strive to walk humbly with God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify of a loving, magnificent, perfect, living Savior - Jesus Christ! He lives. His grace is sufficient to change your nature, and to bestow upon you his glorious gift of charity as you seek to be one of his true followers.</p>
<p>I testify that the power and gift and authority of God are in full restored force upon the earth within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! Come unto it, wherever you're coming from, and you will come unto Christ. As members of his Church we are not perfect, we don't claim to be, but we do have the priesthood authority of God. I am positive of that, and I know that it is real!</p>
<p>I witness that you are a magnificent, beautiful, and invaluable child of God! Your worth is incalculable. I testify that God loves you, and that he will bless you in your effort to learn and remember that always, and that in so doing you will be filled with love for others. You will then, eventually, be a fully engaged participant in the thrilled welcoming party when at that great and last day--during that glorious reunion--you turn around and see your brothers and sisters return home to God, even so-and-so!</p>
<p>This I testify all this to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>August 25, 2015<br />Mailefihi Niutupuivaha<br />President, Laie Hawaii YSA 1st Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="Body">Sister Niutupuivaha:</p>
<p class="Body">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you this beautiful morning and to introduce my husband.&nbsp; He was born and lived in the village of Mu’a of Tonga.&nbsp; He is the fourth of eight children.&nbsp; Although four girls were born after him, he was treated as the baby boy and his mother continues to hold that title for him in her heart. His father and mother, Mailefihi and Solia, raised him in a gospel-centered home. Daily scripture study, journal writing, family home evening, weekly temple attendance, fasting, paying tithing and a generous fast offering were the testimonies his parents lived by, day in and day out. In Tonga, grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles surround his life. Throughout his childhood he remembers his cousins singing songs during their family home evenings.</p>
<p class="Body">My husband loves math. He attended Liahona High School, and was the top mathematics and accounting student.&nbsp; In Liahona High, there are two separate schools - one specifically for academics and the other for learning a trade. One year, his parents visited the United States, leaving his oldest sister, Lisita, the responsibility for watching him. She was informed that he was skipping his academic classes and was found in the shop classes.&nbsp; When his mother found out, she spoke with him.&nbsp; He told her that he loved working with his hands, learning how to fix cars, and working with the tools.&nbsp; His mother knew this to be true. Since he was young, he would take apart things, such as appliances, radios, and toys, and challenge himself to try to put it back together. His talents from building and flying model planes, to fixing motorcycles or building custom homes have brought him great joy.</p>
<p class="Body">He was called to serve in the Kingston, Jamaica Mission. He loved his mission, his mission president and the people of Jamaica. In his patriarchal blessing, he was blessed with the ability to learn languages. One day, early in our marriage, he was on the phone with a native Jamaican elder whom he had served with. I could not make out their conversation. I had never heard him speak patios before, even though they were using English words. my husband spoke with a thick accent and conversed with great ease. It was fun just to watch.</p>
<p class="Body">After our missions, we both had a feeling that we would meet our eternal companions in Provo, Utah. One Sunday, I met with my Bishop and he pronounced a blessing on my head, that when I met my eternal companion, our children would dance around us. My father had given me a blessing a couple months before I met Jr.&nbsp; He said that the way you will meet your eternal companion would be like none other before.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to share with you the story about how we met. The week I met my husband was most likely the toughest week I had ever had while attending school.&nbsp; Things just seemed to be falling apart for me.&nbsp; I felt like a failure.&nbsp; My friend, Opapo Fonoimoana, who had served with my husband in Jamaica, that his mission companion was coming to visit. However, I was not very interested. One morning I was getting ready for work as I put on my make up, I could hear these words loud and clear,&nbsp; “Opapo’s mission companion is so handsome,”&nbsp; “Opapo’s mission companion is very wonderful.”&nbsp; I looked at the mirror, and asked, “who is Opapo’s mission companion?”&nbsp; The voice kept on, “Opapo’s mission companion is so sweet. Opapo’s mission companion is so beautiful!”&nbsp; I didn’t understand what I was hearing but I could not deny what I heard.&nbsp; Later that afternoon, I walked in my home to meet Opapo, on the ground there sat his mission companion. He got up to shake my hand, the moment our hands touched, and there was such an electric shock that raced through my hand to the rest of my body that I took my hand back quickly. I had never felt anything like it before.&nbsp; That week, my husband had a strong prompting to ask me out, I said yes, and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">We were blessed with children immediately. One day, when my oldest was about three, he said to me when I was cooking dinner in the kitchen, “Mommy your handsome prince is home! Mommy your wonderful husband is home.”&nbsp; At that moment, my memory recalled the voices I heard that morning when I was putting on my make-up.&nbsp; Our Heavenly Father allowed me, with tender mercy, to identify the voice that had brought my husband and I together.&nbsp; It was our oldest son Sefanaia.&nbsp; Bishop’s blessing came to my mind,&nbsp; “When you meet your eternal companion, your children will dance around you.”</p>
<p class="Body">Well, we have eight children, six boy and two girls. The oldest is 12 and the youngest is one. They are a three-ring circus, war zone, and heaven all rolled into one.&nbsp; Our children mean so much to us. They have brought so much life, character, and joy into our lives. We love each of them and pray that they will love and stay close to our Father in Heaven, and stand as a witness for Him throughout their lives.</p>
<p class="Body">I remember, on one occasion, he was asked to go to the Hau’ula Chapel Oceanside to fix the electrical problem with the fire alarm. Our family was there for a couple hours. He had no helpers, since I had to take care of the small children. He was climbing up the ladder to test and fix wires in the ceiling and then down to check wires in another room. When my husband was finished, he reported about the completed work to a brother who came to close up the chapel. The look on that brother’s face surprised me.&nbsp; He said, “Do you know how many electricians have come to check this system out? This system has been out for a long time, I was expecting you to tell me the same thing.”&nbsp; I remember that day vividly, because it reminds me that he desires to do his best. Like that fire alarm, our marriage, our family, our relationship have all seen times when the felt like they were not working. He has been the one to get out the ladder, find out what was not working, and lead the family through prayer, scripture study, personal priesthood interviews, weekly temple attendance, fasting, and couples inventory. I love to see my husband serve the Lord. I see his pre-mortal spirit when he serves the Lord. Thank you for allowing me to share these things with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">President Niutupuivaha:</p>
<p class="Body">Aloha Brothers and Sisters.</p>
<p class="Body">I’m grateful to be humbled by this wonderful opportunity to address you all this morning. I’m grateful to President Wheelwright and President Tanner for this great blessing. I want to thank the university employees who have assisted me in the preparation and the presentation of my message this morning. I have enjoyed the peace from the Holy Spirit that assisted me during my preparation.</p>
<p class="Body">I’m humbled by this opportunity to represent the Savior in my new calling as a Stake president here on campus. My weaknesses stare me down and seem to magnify every single day. I told my brothers the other day, “I don’t feel like a Stake president. I don't look like a stake president. I don't talk like a Stake President. I don't know what Heavenly Father saw in me”. I’m humbled that the Lord would call me, and entrust me with one of His precious Stakes of Zion, despite all my weaknesses.</p>
<p class="Body">I’m grateful for goodly parents, who sacrificed all they have ever had to ensure that my siblings and I were rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ. My Father was the hardest-working man that I have ever known, and my mother is the most spiritual person that I have ever known. My mother was completely transformed by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Right before I was born, she intensely studied the Doctrine and Covenants, and gained a very powerful testimony of the Church. She studies her scriptures every single day, and some days that is all that she would do.&nbsp; She would always be taking notes. A lot of times when I needed to know where to find a certain scripture, I would go to her. About half the time when I walk into her room, I would find her on her knees praying audibly to Heavenly Father. She was not always this way.&nbsp; She use to be a very tough lady to be around, most people feared her. The natural man would, at times, get the better of her. She taught at Liahona High School for 20 years. Her rage caused her to throw one of the boys in her class through the glass window one time. Luckily it was Tonga, if it happened here she would have been sued, fired and whatever else.</p>
<p class="Body">My brothers and I were recently in Tonga for a surprise trip to meet her. She is currently serving her second mission there in the Nukualofa Tonga Temple.&nbsp; One of her students approached my older brother at the airport and said to him, “ You look like one of Solia’s sons. How is she?”&nbsp; My brother replied, “She is here, in Tonga, serving a mission in the Temple.”&nbsp; She almost fainted and said to my brother, “Your mother? On a mission? How is that possible?”&nbsp; I love her with all my heart. Everything that I am and will become is because of her enduring faith, love and dedication to the Master.</p>
<p class="Body">My father passed away 12 years ago at the early age of 63. I miss my dad dearly. He was a short man, but was a giant of a man to me. He lost his father when he was seven years old.&nbsp; His mother could not afford tuition for school, so he would spend his evenings picking coconuts to sell, to pay his own way through school. When he graduated from high school, he collected coconuts again to save money to come here, to what was then called the Church College of Hawaii, where He met and married our mother.</p>
<p class="Body">He was a perfect home teacher, who would never let a single month go by without serving the Lord as a home teacher. I learned later from a testimony by president Fonua Lauaki, who served in the Laie Hawaii North Stake Presidency, that if it were not for my father’s faithful service as a home teacher, he nor his family would be active Latter Day Saints today. He served as the first Bishop in Mua where he lived. He was ordained as a high priest and a Bishop by Elder Howard W. Hunter, who was then an apostle.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">One of the reasons why I miss my Dad is that he used to be be my wake-up call. Whenever I need to be up early for school or work, I would ask him to wake me up, and he never failed. He would always wake me up.&nbsp; I am not a morning person at all, and it is a weakness that irritates my brothers greatly. I wish I could do what my dad could do. He would be up till 3 AM quite often because of his business and would sleep for a couple of hours, and would be up bright and early again the next morning to wake us all up for scripture study.</p>
<p class="Body">My older brother would sometimes spend the night at my house, because our mother lived with me. He would get so irritated, because my alarm would go off forever and it would wake him up 4 rooms away, but I would be fast asleep right next to it. Quite often in my prayers I call upon the Angels to minister to me and to wake me up when I really need to wake up. I even ask Heavenly Father to please send dad to wake me up again, if he's available.</p>
<p class="Body">My family and I are eternally grateful for the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ, for the directions and countless blessings that we have enjoyed.</p>
<p class="Body">Three months before receiving this call to be the Stake President, I walked into my office, as a Bishop, and almost audibly I heard a voice saying, “Your time here in this calling is coming to an end.”&nbsp; The thought kept reoccurring that it troubled me. I did not know what it meant, but I tried all I could to ensure that all was well with the ward, before the time came for me to be released. Two months later, we met as Bishops with President Hanneman, he announced that he would be getting released. He told us to prepare for an interview with Elder Sitati, who would be traveling to Hawaii to release him.&nbsp; I remember vividly that morning, as I sat directly across from President Hanneman, the same voice that spoke to me two months prior, said to me “You will be the next stake president.” I was blown away by this thought and dismissed it as quickly as it came to me. I could not think straight for the duration of that meeting as the feeling remained strong and I was not able to concentrate on much else.</p>
<p class="Body">President Hanneman asked us to share this information with our wives, but to keep it very confidential. I was so scared that I did not even share what was happening with my wife. That night, before I went to bed, it came again, this time with more clarity – “You will be the next stake president, and Dennis Mataia will be your counselor.”&nbsp; For the next few weeks I encountered countless trials of my faith and testimony, and was still too scared to tell my wife. She and I went on a business trip to Maui for a day, several days before my interview with Elder Sitati, and I remember telling her, “Honey, I think I will be the next stake president.” She did not respond and I paid no attention. She then asked me later on that day, “Honey you mentioned something about a new stake president, who do you think it will be?” I answered and said, “Me, Honey!”&nbsp; I wish I could have recorded the look on her face when I said that.&nbsp; Believe me, her facial expression was showing exactly how I was feeling at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">The time came to meet with Elder Sitati and Elder Auna for an interview. The interview went well. I answered all of their questions and then left with no feelings at all. I thought, “Well that was interesting. I wonder why the Lord gave me those promptings?”&nbsp; I was being interviewed together with men who were far more intelligent, humble, and looked more like the Stake President type, so I left relieved thinking, “Good, I’m glad that’s over”.&nbsp; A few hours later my wife and I were at home we were planning to go to Honolulu. When my cell phone rang. Before even looking at the phone the same voice tells me, “Get ready, here it comes!” I looked at my phone, and sure enough it was Roberto, the Executive Secretary.&nbsp; He said, “Bishop Niutupuivaha, how soon will you and your wife be able to make it here to the Stake Center?”&nbsp; I replied, “Twenty minutes.” We got ready and as I was driving over I thought, “Good.&nbsp; It’s been a few hours, they have already called the Stake president. I will be one of his counselors or called to some other Stake office.”&nbsp; When we arrived, Roberto asked us to be seated in the waiting area, as Elder Sitati and Elder Auna are just now breaking their Fast. I was so overwhelmed at that point, that I started balling like a baby. The Spirit was telling me, “I tried to warn you.”</p>
<p class="Body">One of the reasons why I studied the natural man so much is because of the strong pull that my flesh has over me at times. I’m grateful for President Hanneman. Once I told my wife, “That man is like Moroni. I will follow him to hell if he asks me to.”&nbsp; I knew he would never ask me to do so, but I wanted to express my respect and love for him. I truly miss serving as a Bishop under his direction.</p>
<p class="Body">It’s interesting that I’m speaking at this devotional here at Brigham Young University-Hawaii. I am number four of eight children. My parents graduated from here in the sixties. All seven of my siblings, countless cousins, aunts and uncles have attended this school, and all have graduated and received degrees from this university. I came here after my mission and met with President Meha, wanting to follow the family tradition of gaining an education here at Brigham Young University. We reviewed all of the majors and courses that were offered here at the time. Nothing sparked my interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">I then looked into the University Hawaii Community Colleges, and saw an Aeronautical Technical course that immediately grabbed my attention. I have always had a passion for airplanes. When I saw the course available in Honolulu, I took it.&nbsp; After studying for three years, I was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration as an Aircraft Technician. Even though I was certified, I have never laid hands or fixed any aircraft or helicopter here in the States. I knew my new profession would pay me well eventually, but soon after graduating from the course, I started looking for jobs and very quickly discovered that I could not support my family with the starting wage that was offered.&nbsp; I was then a brand new husband living here in Hawaii, the most expensive place to live here in the United States. It became very clear that I could not afford to take a pay cut to pursue a career in the profession that I spent 3 years of my life studying for.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">During this time I worked for Innovative Electric, The largest non-union electrical company in Hawaii. Tevita Pasi, the owner, who has now passed on, later became my business partner and we ventured off into some very interesting commercial and industrial projects together.</p>
<p class="Body">I was paid very well as an electrician and Tevita put me through school to become a certified electrician. Some of you will be moving into to Hale 3 and 5 soon. If any electrical problems come up, don't tell anybody, okay?</p>
<p class="Body">In the beginning, there was a war in Heaven, where Satan and his angels were casted out. We know that Satan did not agree with our Fathers plan, which is, in essence, for all of us to come to earth, to receive physical bodies, and to gain experience, be tested, and tried.&nbsp; He wanted to come down to earth and force everyone to obey him; not only that, he wanted to take all honor upon himself. We know the Savior accepted our Father’s plan and offered to come down and fulfill the entire plan, and that all glory would remain with the Father forever.</p>
<p class="Body">This earth, the one that we now live in, was then created. Adam and Eve were placed in the garden, and were given very specific commandments to multiply and replenish this earth. &nbsp;This was a very interesting commandment at this time for them, because it was one that they could not keep. Lehi teaches and I quote from <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.22-23?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:22-23</a>:</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;“And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</p>
<p class="Body">And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.”</p>
<p class="Default">If Adam and Eve obeyed this law and not have partaken of the forbidden fruit, they would have still been here today. Moreover, none of us would be sitting here today - the eternal plan of the Eternal Father would have been frustrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">Christians, including some in this church, sometimes frown upon our first parents, and tend to say, “How could they have been so disobedient?” We learn from the scriptures that in order for the Father’s plan to be complete, they had to partake of the forbidden fruit. The tree of life was also in the Garden. Jehovah sent an Angel to guard the tree, because if they were to partake of this fruit they would again become immortal and live forever in sin.</p>
<p class="Default">The Savior of the world came to earth as a mortal being.&nbsp; He was Jehovah, the Messiah, and Redeemer of mankind.&nbsp; His descension from His throne above, was always part of our Father’s Plan. We have a glimpse of the pain that the Savior went through, by his prayer to the Father in the Garden of Gethsemane. HE, the most revered son of our Father, the first born, the most obedient son of all, He who would always say “Yes Father, Thy will be done.”&nbsp; I can imagine him suffering and saying, “Dad, this is too hard. I had no idea it would hurt so much. Please, if possible let this cup pass from me, but nevertheless thy will be done.”&nbsp; I love the Savior and I strive daily to please him in all I do.</p>
<p class="Default">Jacob, in the Book of Mormon gives us a glimpse of what might have been, had the Savior shrunk from his important role in the Plan I quote <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.7-9?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:7-9</a>:</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>“</strong>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement—save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</p>
<p class="Default">O the wisdom of God; His mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more, our spirits will become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more. Our spirits will become like him. We become devils, from angels to a devil, who will be shut out from the presence of our God, and remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.”</p>
<p class="Default">I’m grateful for our Savior, for his endurance, and for removing us from the grasps of hell that were for sure to engulf each of us. We learn, here, of the grim reality would have been ours, if the Savior decided not to go through with his portion of the Plan. We would have been devils forever, angels to the devil.&nbsp; Shut out from the kingdom of God forever. We are all forever in His debt. I love and revere the Savior.</p>
<p class="Default">I’m very grateful for our Father Adam, and for his great role in our Fathers Masterful Plan, and Mother Eve’s decision to partake of the fruit, to know, feel, and understand more. It was all, from the beginning, necessary. The minute they partook of the fruit, their bodies were changed. They were no longer immortal. They became subjected to everything that you and I are subjected to today.</p>
<p class="Default">Abinadi sheds light on the condition of their new bodies, I quote <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Mosiah 16:3</a>:</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>“</strong>For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish”</p>
<p class="Default">The nature of their immortal bodies was that they were in a state of innocence.&nbsp; They were neither happy nor sad; good nor bad. They could not commit any sin. We now learn that their new bodies, the ones that even all of us here today dwell in, were and are carnal, sensual, and devilish.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">Lehi furthermore enlightens us on this matter:</p>
<p class="Default">“And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of His Holy Spirit;</p>
<p class="Default">And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.28-29?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:28-29</a>)</p>
<p class="Default">We learn here that it is the will of the Holy Spirit that each of us gain Eternal life.&nbsp; We also learn here, brothers and sisters, that our flesh, these tabernacles that you and I dwell in, its will and desire is that each of us, all of us, attain eternal death. The evil that is inherently within all of us because of the flesh that does not want to live with God. I quote King Benjamin from <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:19</a>:</p>
<p class="Default">“For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint.”</p>
<p class="Default">The minute Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit they were enemies of God.&nbsp; The flesh will always be an Enemy to God. We then, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, are automatically an enemy to God; unless we yield to the enticing of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The same Holy Spirit that desires for us to gain eternal life.&nbsp; If we do not yield to His enticing, we are automatically enemies to our Father by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">Pornography is rampant today, because it satisfies the flesh. It pleases the flesh to look upon it. How do we overcome pornography? We can do so by yielding to the enticing of the Holy Spirit. I quote Elder Andersen from His<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/04/spiritual-whirlwinds?lang=eng" target="_blank"> April 2014 General Conference Address</a>:</p>
<p class="Default">“My young friends, the world will not glide calmly toward the Second Coming of the Savior. The scriptures declare that “all things shall be in commotion.”<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><sup>1</sup></span> Brigham Young said, “It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise.”<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p class="Default">Brothers and sisters, we are living during those times mentioned in the quote. The power of Satan is rising and wickedness is covering this earth. Our flesh, the natural man, within each of us desires to follow Satan. To paraphrase Lehi, it is the will of the flesh to choose eternal death, and that gives Satan the power to captivate us. The world is full of filth and garbage that can very easily distract us. As Elder Andersen warns, this world will not glide calmly toward the second coming, this is self-evident in the world today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">As you all know, Adam and Eve could not bear children. The ability to bring Heavenly Father’s children into this earth was made possible by this natural state that we are in. The strong feelings of our mortal bodies were put there by our Father as part of his plan. Elder Robins of the Presidency of the Seventy put it this way. “Sexual sin is not the use of something <strong>inherently bad</strong>, but the misuse of something <strong>inherently good</strong>.”&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, and especially brothers, you must contain yourselves, you must bridle all your passions. You cannot and must not view pornography. If you have become entangled in its grasp, please do not become discouraged. There is always help nearby. Push through the darkness and embrace the iron rod once again, and seek help from your loving Bishop.</p>
<p class="Default">The savior taught in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">D&amp;C 42:23</a>:</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>“</strong>And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out.”</p>
<p class="Default">Remember, to overcome the natural man, we have to have the Spirit. We will never have the Spirit if we are viewing pornography or anything like it. One of the most powerful ways to receive the Spirit is through daily study of the scriptures. Nephi saw the power of the scriptures and describes it this way to his brothers <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.23-24?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">1 Nephi 15:&nbsp;23-24</a>:</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>“</strong>And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?</p>
<p class="Default">And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.”</p>
<p class="Default">This scripture was shared by Elder Holland of the Quorum of the twelve, a few years back, during a training meeting for Bishops and Stake presidents here in Hawaii. He shared it in response to the question “how do we help our young people overcome pornography and all the other issues they struggle with?” What a great promise, not only from the scriptures, but also from a living ordained apostle. The promise is that if we hold fast unto the word of God, neither the temptations nor the fiery darts of the adversary can overcome us unto blindness.</p>
<p class="Default">In April 1982, Elder Bruce&nbsp;R. McConkie spoke to the regional representatives about the priority the scriptures should take in our labors. He said: “We are so wound up in programs and statistics and trends, in properties, lands and mammon, and in achieving goals that will highlight the excellence of our work, that we have ‘omitted the weightier matters of the law.’ … However talented men may be in administrative matters; however eloquent they may be in expressing their views; however learned they may be in the worldly things—they will be denied the sweet whisperings of the Spirit that might have been theirs unless they pay the price of studying, pondering, and praying about the scriptures.” (In Regional Representatives’ Seminar, 2 Apr. 1982, pp.&nbsp;1–2.)</p>
<p class="Default">Brothers and sisters we will be denied, shut out, do not pass go, or however you want to put it, the sweet whisperings of the Holy Spirit if we do not study and ponder the scriptures. This is pretty strong clear language, from an ordained servant of the Lord, therefore it is His mind and will.</p>
<p class="Default">I share a Quote from President Kimball:</p>
<p class="Default">“I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel.”</p>
<p class="Default">One of my favorite stories is one that I heard on my mission, told by Brother Hyrax Smith. Please bear with me as I read this story straight from one of Brother Smith’s talks:</p>
<p class="Default">A naturalist is walking by a farm and he looked into the chicken coop and there among the chickens was a large eagle. The farmer had found a giant egg and put it in with the chickens. He thought it was a funny-looking chicken but nonetheless, it was raised as a chicken. So the naturalist went to the farmer and says, “You know, you got an eagle out there with your chickens.”</p>
<p class="Body">“No, I don’t have any eagles, just chickens.”</p>
<p class="Body">“Well, come here. I want to show you. You got an eagle out there.”&nbsp; The naturalist takes the farmer out to the coop, points to the eagle and says, “That is an eagle.”</p>
<p class="Body">“No, it’s a chicken.”</p>
<p class="Body">“No. I know what eagles look like and have you ever seen a chicken with an 8-foot wingspan? That is an eagle.</p>
<p class="Body">“No, it’s a chicken.”</p>
<p class="Body">“I’ll prove to you it’s an eagle.” So the naturalist takes this eagle and puts him up on a fence post and points the eagle’s head towards the sun and whispers in his ear, “You are an eagle. Fly.”&nbsp; The eagle looks up at the sun, he looks back at the chickens and he jumps off the fence and goes back and scratches with the chickens.</p>
<p class="Body">The farmer says, “Hey, I told you. That’s a chicken.”</p>
<p class="Body">“No. That’s an eagle and tomorrow I’ll prove it to you.”</p>
<p class="Body">The next day the naturalist comes back and takes the eagle up to the weather vane of the barn, points the eagle’s head towards the sun and says to the eagle, “You are an eagle. Fly.”&nbsp; The eagle looks up at the sun, he looks back at the chickens and he jumps off the weather vane and goes back and scratches with the chickens.</p>
<p class="Body">The farmer says, “Look, I’m really sorry, but that’s a chicken.”</p>
<p class="Body">The naturalist says, “No. That’s an eagle. Tomorrow I’ll prove it to you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">The next day the naturalist comes back and takes the eagle up to a high mountain where he couldn’t see the chicken coop anymore. The naturalist puts the eagle out on the edge of a cliff, points the eagle’s head towards the sun and says to the eagle, “You are an eagle. Fly.” The eagle looks up at the sun, he looks around, he spread his wings and he flew. He flew out over the countryside and never looked or came back. The naturalist turns to the farmer and says, “That is an eagle.”</p>
<p class="Body">Brothers and Sisters we were born eagles. We, each of us, are Sons and Daughters of our Father in Heaven. We have a divine birth right. We are meant to one day become just like our Heavenly Father, to become eagles, so to speak. We are born into mortality and are given these bodies of flesh to test us to see if we are worthy of all that the Father has, to see if we will remain as chickens, or will overcome our natures and fly like the eagles that we are.</p>
<p class="Body">Like the naturalist in this story, the Holy Spirit is constantly whispering in our ears, “You are an Eagle. Fly!” It is imperative that we are worthy to receive the promptings of the Spirit everyday of our lives.</p>
<p class="Body">The only way you and I can discover our wings and put off the natural man is to yield to the enticing of the Holy Spirit. In order to be able to yield to the enticing of the Spirit, we must first have the Spirit to always be with us. We learn from the Sacrament prayer that we achieve this goal by always remembering the Savior and to keep all the commandments that He has given us.</p>
<p class="Body">Brothers and Sisters, you, as young people here in this university, have your whole lives ahead of you. The decisions that you will make in your lives today will determine the course of your lives. Not just for time here upon this earth, but for all eternity. We need to have the Spirit with us all day, every single day. I know how difficult this is for we constantly struggle with our flesh.</p>
<p class="Body">I was once where you are today. Faced with life’s challenges, making sense of things and trying to control all of the emotions and feelings that your bodies go through. You try to answer some of life’s most challenging questions: What will I do for the rest of my life and who will I spend eternity with?</p>
<p class="Body">When I was single years ago, President Hinckley said, “The most important decision you will ever make in this life, is the person you choose to marry.” This thought really troubled me, and I wanted to heed the prophet’s voice by choosing the right person. It occupied my thoughts day and night.&nbsp; My young friends, in order to see and find who is most compatible with you spiritually, you must use your spiritual eyes. If you are in your natural state, the state of being carnal, sensual and devilish, you will see through those natural eyes, and may find and marry someone that you really are not compatible with. Divorce numbers are rising and sadly even in the Church.</p>
<p class="Body">I served my mission in Kingston Jamaica, I had a very wealthy, funny mission president, President Calvert. From what I was told, he owned a very successful law firm. I saw his wallet once, and boy it was full of all kinds of large Jamaican and U.S. bills. He would always tell us as missionaries to look for your eternal companion, but don’t be obsessed with it. Become anxiously engaged in a good cause and serve the Lord and you will find your eternal companion along the way. He told us that when he was going through college, he bagged groceries at the local supermarket. One day the Football team’s Quarterback walks in with his girlfriend so she could buy some things. President would say, “So here she was, the Quarterback’s girlfriend, right in front of me. I’m waiting to bag her items, and watch her as she turns to her boyfriend and say, ‘I’m short 20 bucks?’&nbsp; The quarterback replies, ‘I don’t have any money’.&nbsp;&nbsp; So as I stood there I reached into to my pocket and handed her a 20 dollar bill.” Then he would go on to say, “I’ve been giving her money ever since”.&nbsp; My short, bald-headed mission president marries the quarterback's pretty girlfriend. He was such a funny man. He would always get up during Zone conferences and butcher my name on purpose so everyone could get a laugh. He would also always say, “Well brethren, God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he put hair on them.”&nbsp; I sure miss and love him.</p>
<p class="Body">So brethren and sisters, for that matter, don’t ever get discouraged. Stay very busy, study hard, work hard, serve hard in your perspective callings, and the Lord will bless you. For some of you this blessing may never come in this life, but we must endure to the end, regardless of the hand that life has dealt us. Our Heavenly Father has promised to take care of each of us.</p>
<p class="Body">President Black would always share this phrase: Become so busy that your sins will die of neglect. You have to always be engaged in something worthwhile, idleness is the devils workshop.</p>
<p class="Body">When I got off my mission the one place that helped me feel safe was the Lord’s temple. I attended every day when I first got home. The Temple President noticed me and asked me if I would like to serve as an ordinance worker. I loved that opportunity and it has blessed my life forever. I would encourage you to see your bishop and ask for an opportunity to serve the Lord in the Temple. It will bless your life more than you can imagine.</p>
<p class="Body">Brothers and Sisters, just as Adam and our Savior Jesus Christ had a part in our Father’s Plan of Salvation, so do each of us. We all have a part in the Father’s Eternal Plan of Salvation. Please do not let your flesh drag you down. The Savior warns us, as He gave the oath and covenant of the priesthood, I quote <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.43?lang=eng#42" target="_blank">D&amp;C 84:43</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>“</strong>And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.”</p>
<p class="Default">The Savior Himself is speaking here and out of everything in this world that He wanted us to be aware of concerning ourselves. Our flesh can drag us down, if we let it. He also warns us to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. The Savior Himself again said to study your scriptures. If we are casual in our prayers and our scripture study, we will not have the power to overcome not only temptation, but even our own selves.</p>
<p class="Default">We are living in the last dispensation of the fullness of times. There will not be another apostasy. The next thing to happen is for the Savior to return and rule and reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords upon this earth. After telling His Apostles that He would be leaving to prepare a place for them and that he would be coming back, they asked, “Master, how will we know when to expect your return?”&nbsp; He then gives the signs of his return. As you all know a lot of those signs have come to pass and are coming to pass before our very eyes. He gives this warning, and I quote from the<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.37?lang=eng#36" target="_blank"> Joseph Smith translation of Matthew, verse 37</a><strong>:</strong><strong>&nbsp;“</strong>And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived, for the Son of Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the remainder of his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”</p>
<p class="Default">My dear brothers and sisters, we must immerse ourselves in the scriptures daily, not merely dipping our feet in it. Elder Scott warns in his<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority?lang=eng&amp;media=video" target="_blank"> October 2014 conference address</a> and I quote:</p>
<p class="Default">“Don’t yield to Satan’s lie that you don’t have time to study the scriptures. Choose to take time to study them. Feasting on the word of God each day is more important than sleep, school, work, television shows, video games, or social media. You may need to reorganize your priorities to provide time for the study of the word of God. If so, do it!</p>
<p class="Default">There are many prophetic promises of the blessings of daily studying the scriptures.</p>
<p class="Default">I add my voice with this promise: as you dedicate time every day, personally and with your family, to the study of God’s word, peace will prevail in your life. That peace won’t come from the outside world. It will come from within your home, from within your family, from within your own heart. It will be a gift of the Spirit. It will radiate out from you to influence others in the world around you. You will be doing something very significant to add to the cumulative peace in the world.”</p>
<p class="Default">I know this with all my heart to be true. We cannot afford to yield to Satan’s lie, that we don’t have time to study the scriptures. Satan will be powerless against you as long as you study faithfully, as Elder Pearson says, “Everyday, everyday, everyday.”&nbsp; Brothers and sisters I know this to be true with all my heart. Every time I read through first Nephi my heart yearns to become steadfast and immovable like the valley that father Lehi saw. I know with all my hearth that this is possible through faithfully immersing ourselves in the scriptures - everyday, everyday, everyday.</p>
<p class="Default">I know that there is a God in Heaven, I know that the Savior Jesus the Christ is His Son.&nbsp; He stands at the Head of this church that bears his name. I know with all my heart that the book of Mormon was written by true prophets. Nephi, Alma, King Benjamin, Moroni, are all real men.&nbsp; I know Joseph saw exactly what he said he saw - the Father and the Son standing in the air above him. I have walked those sacred grounds and have felt our Fathers Love there.</p>
<p class="Default">May we all have the courage and determination to daily immerse ourselves in the scriptures. I humbly share these things with you in the sacred name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

http://devotional.byuh.edu/media150811<br><title>Welcome Your Trials of Life  | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>August 11, 2015<br />Billy G. Casey Jr.<br />President, Laie Hawaii YSA 2nd Stake <br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha Brothers and Sisters, I am humbled by this opportunity that I have to speak to you today. I pray that the Spirit will help me to deliver the message that will touch your hearts in a way that would please our Heavenly Father. &nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></em></p>
<p>I am so grateful for my lovely and eternal companion Kanani, and for my family. For those of you that know me, you already know that the most important thing in my life is my family and my desire to qualify myself to live with them eternally.</p>
<p>To qualify for the blessings of eternity we must all prove ourselves worthy. As a result, in this life, we pass through all kinds of trials, challenges, and tests. Sometimes these burdens are light, but other times they tax our very souls and require us to carry a heavy burden for years. These trials can be an assortment of difficult personal challenges that are physical, emotional, temporal, or spiritual in nature.</p>
<p>These storms in life basically come from three sources. First there are natural products of the conditions of the world that we live in; illness, disease, depression, and physical disabilities. There are natural elements such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, devastating storms, or other disasters. There are economic adversities, such as loss of job, not finding employment after graduation, the high cost of living, and large debt because of long term illness etc.</p>
<p>Secondly, we may be required to bear burdens and trials because of the result of the misconduct and actions of others through no fault of our own. Abuse, gossip, false accusations, repression, sin, and crime may tax our souls.</p>
<p>The third source of adversity and trials that we might suffer may be the consequences and results of our own actions, mistakes, shortcomings, and transgressions.</p>
<p>Alma testified to his son Helaman,</p>
<p>“And&nbsp;now,&nbsp;O&nbsp;my&nbsp;son&nbsp;Helaman,&nbsp;behold,&nbsp;thou&nbsp;art&nbsp;in&nbsp;thy youth,&nbsp;and&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;I&nbsp;beseech&nbsp;of&nbsp;thee&nbsp;that&nbsp;thou&nbsp;wilt&nbsp;hear my&nbsp;words&nbsp;and&nbsp;learn&nbsp;of&nbsp;me;&nbsp;for&nbsp;I&nbsp;do&nbsp;know&nbsp;that&nbsp;whosoever shall&nbsp;put&nbsp;their&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in&nbsp;God&nbsp;shall&nbsp;be&nbsp;supported&nbsp;in&nbsp;their trials,&nbsp;and&nbsp;their&nbsp;troubles,&nbsp;and&nbsp;their&nbsp;afflictions,&nbsp;and&nbsp;shall&nbsp;be lifted&nbsp;up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;last&nbsp;day.” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Alma 36:3</a></p>
<p>I know that many of you have either already gone through some type of major adversity in your lives, or you know someone close to you that has or maybe is currently experiencing a trial of their faith. This is one thing that must take place in this earthly existence, we must face adversity.</p>
<p>Those of you who are students, during your academic studies here at BYU–Hawaii have and/or will experience trials in the form of exams, quizzes, reports, and term papers. Your professors use these tools to test and measure your understanding and knowledge of the information that they desire for you to grasp, of what they will present to you during the course of your studies.</p>
<p>Likewise, our Heavenly Father allows us to face trials and adversity in this life to measure our faith and our commitment to obey His commandments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many members in the church seem to have a misconception that by living righteously this will prevent them from having to face trials in their lives. But as we study the scriptures, church history, and look into the lives of the prophets we see that is not the case. It is required of all of us to test our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our commitment to His commandments.&nbsp; Trials and difficulties are a necessary part of life and not a sign that the Lord has forgotten us or is displeased with us.</p>
<p>The brethren have taught us that no matter what our trials are in this life, whether we or someone we love are battling an addiction - to tobacco, drugs, gambling, pornography or other transgressions; whether we have trouble in our marriage or other family relationships; problems with self-esteem, depression, disease or death; or whether they come from the burden of financial debt; whatever other step you may need to take to resolve these concerns, we must come first to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The brothers Nephi and Lehi remembered the words that their father Helaman spoke unto them.</p>
<p>“And now my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Helaman 5:12</a></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, in my life I have learned that trials, regardless how small or how difficult and burdensome they seem to us, are key factors in the development of our character, in the development of who we are, and who we can become. We cannot avoid them because they are an essential part of this life’s experience. We should not dread them. We must understand their purpose and their place in our lives. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We must not only endure them, but we must endure them well.</span></strong> I will be sharing with you three of the trials that I and my family have experienced, how they have impacted our lives, and how we have grown from these experiences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trial of Financial Crisis</span></p>
<p>When faced with difficult adversity and trials many ask, "why me Lord?" I know that I did during one of my trials earlier in my life. I remember crying to the Lord pleading with Him when I faced this trial. This was the first time that I and my family had faced a major financial crisis in my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a small successful business with ten employees. I was a roofing and waterproofing contractor here in Hawaii. A trade that I had learn from my father since I was ten years old. Every weekend, holiday, and summer in my teenage years I would work for my father’s roofing company. This was a hard profession and I am thankful to my father that he taught me the blessings and the principles of hard work.</p>
<p>By the time my father had planned to retire, his company had grown to be one of the largest roofing companies here in Hawaii at the time. He had always hoped that I would take over the family business. He asked me to leave my small successful business and come over to his company to manage it and become part owner of it. I discussed this move with my wife and we saw this as a wonderful opportunity of growth and to continue his legacy. So I left my small business and took over as general manager of my father’s company. As often happens in the construction industry, his roofing company was strapped financially when I joined them. My father had exhausted his and the company’s resources to borrow money and the company owed a lot taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After discussing the situation with my wife we decided to take out a large mortgage on our home that I had built, and loan the money to my father’s company. We had confidence in my ability to turn things around financially for the company since I would now be the one managing it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was a bigger task than we had anticipated. We were forced to shut down the company, in doing so I had lost the money that we had loan to the company, and I knew that it was inevitable that we would lose our home, displacing my young family.</p>
<p>After shedding a lot tears while praying, I remember experiencing a beautiful peaceful feeling that came over me as our Heavenly Father let me know in a very personal way that all would be well, and that this trial was for my growth and development. It was a long and hard trial but I and my family were able to endure it well.</p>
<p>I testify that the Savior’s Atonement not only lifts us from the burden of our sins and but also it lifts us from the burden of our disappointments and sorrows, our heartaches and our despair.</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said, “Every [person] eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there… must make his stand.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Physical Trial of Health</span></p>
<p>Another trial in my life occurred with I was the age of most of you students. It was August 1976. I too was a student here at BYU–Hawaii. I had returned from faithfully serving a mission in Mexico-Veracruz. I was in love, and was about to ask my future father-in-law permission for my wife’s hand in marriage. Kanani and I had spent the day together selecting a humble wedding ring. I remember it as a small white gold ring with a little diamond dust on it. Being a poor student, this was all I could afford.</p>
<p>It was Monday and we had planned to let each of our families know during each of the FHE’s that evening. I had dropped Kanani off at her house in Kahaluu, and then rushed home to Punaluu to get ready. I will not at this time share the details of what happened next, but let you know that I was in a large gasoline explosion, and as a result forty percent of my body was covered in burns, the majority of which were third degree burns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was given a priesthood blessing by my Elder’s Quorum President that just happened to be at my house at the time, he then rushed me to the hospital in his truck. Later at the hospital I received another priesthood blessing from my father. I have never experienced a greater pain in my entire life than with this experience. My burns were so bad that the doctors told me that I would be transferred to a burns center on the mainland where I would undergo skin grafts, and that this process would take many months to complete and to heal.</p>
<p>Through the countless prayers that were made on my behalf by my family, friends, and ward members, and through the power of the priesthood, I was the recipient of a miracle. They did not have to fly me to a burns center on the mainland, in fact I did not receive any skin grafts. Where my flesh had been chard and my skin burnt away, new skin formed and grew by itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I recognized that I was witnessing a miracle, and that I was starting to heal without any scars, I thanked the Lord and promised Him that I would always honor my Temple covenants and would always make sure that I was properly clothed in my garments. I then asked for the Lord to leave me a small scar that would always remind me of this miracle. He left a small scar on my leg as I had asked. Now every time I get dressed this small scar reminds me of these sacred covenants that I have made and the miracle that took place with this experience.</p>
<p>This trial taught me and those who prayed on my behalf, about the power of Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the power of prayer, the power of His Priesthood, and that miracles still take place in these days. It also showed me how much my future wife loved me, and that she would stand by me through adversity and trials. In just ten days I was released from the hospital instead of after months in a burns center. After three weeks of convalescing in my home, I returned to BYU–Hawaii to resume my studies and to play for the Seasider basketball team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Life is a test. Trials may come even if we are seeking to put the Lord first in our lives. One of the reasons we are here on earth is to strengthen our faith. Difficult, dark days are a necessary part of life and give us an opportunity to build our faith and learn to rely on a power far greater than our own.” – Larry W. Gibbons</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trial of Disaster</span></p>
<p>The last trial that I will share with you, I vividly remember what I and my family had to bear. On March 23, 2011 at 5:30 AM, I and my family awoke to find that our house was fully engulfed in flames. After getting everyone safely out of the house, I remember standing outside with my family as we watched our home with all of our earthly possessions burn to the ground. I was so very thankful that I had beside me what was really important to me; my eternal companion and my family.</p>
<p>Later that morning as we took refuge under our neighbor’s mango tree, we held a family council. My married children had joined us by then, we had family prayer, thanking the Lord for our protection, and then we asked for His Spirit and guidance, and then we discussed what we needed to do.&nbsp; Assignments were made and we began to face our new trial. This time we were more seasoned. This time we did not ask “why me Lord?” We already knew from facing other trials in our lives that the Lord was ready to bless us if we endured this trial well, if we walked by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>My stake president, President Shumway and his counselors came by to give me a priesthood blessing of comfort. A blessing that gave to me clarity of what I needed to do to take care of and provide for my family in this time of trial in our lives.</p>
<p>At the time I was serving in the BYU–Hawaii Married Student Stake Presidency. Our neighbors, ward members, friends, and members from the student stakes rushed to our side to assist us. The fire left us with nothing but the clothes on our backs.</p>
<p>One ward member and friends put us into their business rental. It was not easy to find a place that could house the nine members of my family that were displaced by the fire. Another ward member called to get the garment sizes of all of the endowed members of my family, she then went and purchased the temple garments and brought them to us. Another ward member came by and dropped off pillows, sheets and blankets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That evening as we went to the member’s rental house that had been provided for us, we found that another friend had stocked the refrigerator and freezer with food.</p>
<p>In the days and weeks that followed friends brought many large plastic bags full of clothes in all sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My family and I were overwhelmed by all the love that we had received. We knew that the Lord was blessing us and showing His love. We were being comforted by heavenly angels, as well as many earthly angels.&nbsp; During this long trial we did not ask “Lord why me?”, instead we asked “Lord, what is it that you want us to do?”&nbsp; We also asked “what is the next step in our journey?”, for it was a journey and a trial in and of itself to be able to rebuild our home in the same location where we had lived for the past 40 years. But that is another story for another time and place.</p>
<p>During this trial we learned that all earthly possessions have no eternal purpose. We cannot take them with us when we leave this earthly existence.&nbsp; It was reinforced to us that the only thing that really matters in this mortal life is what we do to qualify as individuals and families to return to the presence of Our Heavenly Father and to live with Him. Everything else that we do is just to help us accomplish these goals.</p>
<p>This trial was not only to make us stronger and refine us, but I know that it was to allow others to gain blessings from the giving of service to my family. I know that we were blessed by their service, but I also know that they were blessed, or will receive blessings in time, because of the service they gave to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am thankful for these trials in my life. For the blessings that they bring to us. For what they teach us. For the tender mercies that we received during these experiences. The few things that did survive the fire increased our testimonies through small miracles in our lives. I know that I am a better person because of them. I have learned to follow the promptings of the Lord. I have learned to walk by faith. I have learned that the Lord loves me and my family, even though we were asked to endure these adversities and trials.</p>
<p>My wife and I have learned to ask the Lord what we are to learn from the trials. Through the Holy Ghost we received revelation on what we were to do to overcome the obstacles that were in our path.&nbsp; We had it reaffirmed to us that faith is a principle of action.&nbsp; We learned that normally the Lord did not answer our prayers and give us the solutions to our problems while we were on our knees, but rather once we began to act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time and time again we were lead through the mine fields of our trials by listening to and acting upon the promptings of the Spirit. We exercised our right to revelation. Granted, answers did not come to us immediately because Our Heavenly Father wanted us to learn from our experiences. He wanted us to grow and develop our abilities. From time to time when we were walking by faith, He would have to give us course corrections. He never let us stray too far in the wrong direction without warning us. The real key is that we had to act with faith, it was not good enough to just believe, hope and pray for him to solve all of our problems</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters please remember that the Atonement of our elder brother Jesus Christ does not just pay for our sins. Yes, it provides us the opportunity of forgiveness if we repent and seek to be forgiven our sins. As wonderful and special as this great gift is, the Atonement does so much more. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can overcome the most difficult trials and adversities of life; we can receive strength to overcome all of our pains and ills; spiritual, physical, temporal, and emotional.</p>
<p>Elder Neil L. Anderson, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, stated</p>
<p>“Like the intense fire that transforms iron into steel, as we remain faithful during the fiery trial of our faith, we are spiritually refined and strengthened.”</p>
<p>Trials refine us. Trials purify us. Trials polish us and help us to reach our divine potential. They help us to develop that noble character that President Tanner taught us about last week. President, I too have a formula that I want to present to our University Ohana of students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Trials + Faith in Christ = Noble Character</strong></p>
<p>When we are faced with difficult trials and we demonstrate our faith in Jesus Christ by keeping the commandments and the covenants that we have made, then we develop that noble character. Then we start to recognize our divine nature.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concluding Remarks</span></p>
<p>In times of trials and adversity we naturally want to be secure. We long to know that everything will be okay, that we will be safe. This is normal, but we know that the only true safety and security comes through the obedience and observance of God’s commandments. So as adversity, challenges, and burdens enter into our lives, it is not enough to just merely endure these trials as we experience them, but we must <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">endure them well!</span></strong>&nbsp;We must continue to show our faith in the Lord, not doubting Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we exercise our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ during these difficult times, the Lord will use these experiences to refine and polish our souls.</p>
<p>As we exercise our faith in Christ we can take comfort in knowing that He has not left us alone. He has provided us with the Gift of the Holy Ghost - &nbsp;&nbsp;a member of the Godhead, which warns us with promptings when we start to lose our way or make wrong choices. If we tune into the Spirit he will be able to give us the course corrections when we need them. He has provided us with the iron rod - the scriptures, the counsel of modern day and living apostles and prophets, and our other priesthood leaders. As we hold firmly to this rod we will be able to withstand this life’s raging storms, our difficult and exhausting trials.</p>
<p>Remember that the adversity, the challenges, the burdens, the trials of our faith are only tests that our Loving Heavenly Father allows us to experience so that we can grow and develop - so that we can strengthen our faith in Him, and in our elder brother Jesus Christ, through prayer, through the power of the priesthood, and through the Atonement.</p>
<p>Remember Brothers and Sisters that in the eternal perspective, all the adversity and all the afflictions that are ours bear, no matter how difficult or how long it may be is only for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“but a small moment, and then, if (we) endure it well, God shall exalt (us) on high.”</span></strong>&nbsp; We must do everything we can to bear our burdens well for however long our “small moment” may be.&nbsp; If we do so, we will develop the noble character that is needed to qualify us to return as divine sons and daughters to live with our Heaven Father. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>August 4, 2015<br />President John and Sister Susan Tanner<br />President and First Lady, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Sister Tanner:</strong></p>
<p>First, Melissa and Jennifer, thank you for that beautiful music, which gave us the message we all needed to hear. Bothers and sisters, aloha! President Tanner and I are so excited to be with you and to welcome you to a new semester here at BYU–Hawaii. Usually at these Devotionals, the wife or the husband gets up and introduces the spouse to you. Today, I am not going to do that in a formal way. I will be giving a small message, and using in my talk some things that may help you to get to know President Tanner a little bit better.</p>
<p>Immediately after we were asked by President Eyring to serve here at BYU–Hawaii, we started reading about the history of Laie and the history of this university. We were thrilled with the prophetic destiny of this place, and wanted to be a part of forwarding those prophecies and helping to make them happen. Today, I would like to talk for a minute just about one of those prophecies from President David O. McKay: &nbsp;that from this place, peace would spread across the Earth. President McKay in the 1955 groundbreaking said several important things for us to know. He said: “for what is this school being built? First, the things pertaining to God and His kingdom, a testimony of the existence of Deity, knowing that He lives and that He is our Father, the Father of all mankind and ruler of brothers and what that means toward peace, establishing peace in the world.” He then said, “The gospel plan… is the only plan by which the world, by obedience to it, may obtain peace,” and continued, “from this school I’ll tell you, will go men and women whose influence will be felt for good toward the establishment of peace internationally.”</p>
<p>How can we participate in fulfilling this prophecy of spreading peace to the world? There are certain words in his quotes that I especially like. He talks about having a testimony of God and knowing that He is our Father - that will help us as we spread peace. He talks about the gospel plan, and particularly obedience to the gospel plan - and that will help us spread peace. I like to think of that as keeping the covenants that we have made, thus helping us to spread peace.</p>
<p>This morning, I will share three small stories about some little pockets of society where people felt and experienced complete harmony and peace. One is scriptural, one is international, and one is within a family.</p>
<p>One of my favorite societies to read about in the scriptures is the Nephite nation after Jesus Christ visited them. This story is recounted in the fourth book of Nephi. How is it that this society lived in peace? We are told in the very first verse in Fourth Nephi that they all repented, were baptized, and received the Holy Ghost. This means that they forsook their sins, covenanted to follow Jesus Christ, and they had the help and companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>This is a model for us to strive for. In verses 4 Nephi:15-17, it describes more of the society that they lived in. It says that they had “no contention” among them. Imagine no contention. They lived with the “love of God in their hearts.” It also says that they had no “envying,” “strifes,” “tumults,” nor “any manner of lasciviousness,” and that a happier people could not be found. There were no robbers, murderers, no Lamanites, nor any “-ites” among them at all. In other words, there were no divisions among them, as they were all children of God and heirs to the kingdom of God. This teaches us, as President McKay did, how it is to live in peace, to have a testimony of our Father, and let the love of God dwell in our hearts. In addition, this teaches us that the Nephites followed the gospel plan, and lived with complete harmony and peace for over a hundred years!</p>
<p>Now a little international story that I had forgotten about until I read President McKay’s words. Over twenty years ago, John and I visited Austria, as part of his assignment at BYU over International Education. It was during the time of the Bosnian War. There was an international stake in Vienna where they held a Young Women camp. In&nbsp;that camp, girls from all the factions of the war were included. There were girls from Bosnia, Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Croatia. However, during that camp, they were not there to represent the politics of their nations, but rather, they remembered that they are daughters of a Heavenly Father, who loves them and they love him. They had promised to stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all things and in all places. As they remembered their covenant to follow the Lord. They had a week of complete joy, love, and peace. Like President McKay had stated, “It was the testimony of God and obedience to the gospel plan that are the keys to peace.”</p>
<p>World peace and international peace are kind of lofty goals that we keep in our minds and hearts, but how many of us can have family peace for even 24 hours? Often our families are the hardest place for us to achieve a society of peace. President Tanner grew up in a family with 13 children. There was not always complete peace in that chaotic household as he grew up. However, his parents were wise and they taught those children to keep their covenants, to bear one another’s burdens, to mourn with those that mourn, and, especially, his father emphasized something that we do not always emphasize. A part of our covenant that we find in Romans 12:15 is that we should “rejoice with them that do rejoice.” This was an amazing part of that covenant for this family. After all, if there are thirteen children and two parents, your birthday celebration only rolls around one time in every 15 birthdays, so you might as well be happy for the others while they are celebrating. Or if you buy a dozen apples, there are not enough to go around for everyone to have one, so you need to learn to be unselfish and you need to learn to rejoice for others in their joys and successes. Among these thirteen now grown adult brothers and sisters, there are extroverts who are very firm-minded, but there is an unmistakable love and peace that they share. I witnessed this in a recent family trip that we took to England. President Tanner acted as a tour guide, because this is his area of expertise. Each one of his brothers and sisters loved, admired and appreciated the things that he taught. There were no jealousies or divisions, only love, admiration, and peace. From their growing-up years, they had learned to rejoice for each other in their successes.</p>
<p>This university, where we are, is a great playing field and a great laboratory, or a special ohana, where we have the opportunity to keep the covenants we have made alongside individuals from over seventy different nations. Imagine the great opportunity to live among each other in peace,&nbsp;with no “-ites” or divisions among us. We can learn to live with people from all cultures and backgrounds, in spite of national politics, like the young women in Yugoslavia and Bosnia. We can covenant to bear one another’s burdens, to mourn with one another, to rejoice with one another, and to rise above jealousies and envying, as in President Tanner’s family. We have made covenants to obey the gospel plan. We have testimonies that God is our loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, may we each keep our covenants so that we can be part of the fulfillment of President McKay’s prophecy, that from this university, we will help establish peace in the world. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>President John S. Tanner:</strong></p>
<p>Aloha! We have felt such love from you and for you in our week on campus. Thank you for welcoming us so warmly.&nbsp; Thank you with aloha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Susan and I have chosen to focus our devotional today on principles found in David O. McKay’s prophetic addresses at the campus groundbreaking 60 years ago, and at the college dedication three years later. We want to begin with the founding. As Maria says in <em>The Sound of Music, </em>“let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.”</p>
<p>In my brief remarks I will focus on two key principles for President McKay, ones he comes back many times in his founding addresses and prayers: 1) the spiritual value of education and 2) the supreme importance of character education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ideals in Education</span></p>
<p>As you know President McKay stood in a cane field at the groundbreaking on February 12, 1955 and boldly prophesied that the college, temple, and town would become a “missionary factor influencing . . . millions of people who will come here” - and this when slightly over 100,000 tourists came to Hawaii in any year. Few of these made it around the island to the North Shore, and even fewer stopped in the obscure little town of Laie. It was an amazing prophecy.</p>
<p>Less well remembered is the revelation that President McKay said “came to me this morning” regarding the “ideals of the Church of Jesus Christ in education.”&nbsp; What are these ideals? They are the principles revealed in 1832 to the Prophet Joseph and re-revealed to President McKay in 1955 urging “all the members of the Church . . . to study and treasure the things of education in all fields.”&nbsp; We are not only to study but to treasure.&nbsp; “Treasure” is President McKay’s unique addition to the Prophet’s language that we are to study. Latter-day Saints should prize and love education, as President McKay did. His enthusiasm is evident as he quotes verses from D&amp;C 88, the Olive Leaf, which he says “came to me this morning, and I wrote the words for you. Right now I cannot do better than to read them . . . as evidence for the need of education.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For President McKay, learning is both a duty and delight. Latter-day Saints are to “teach one another . . . diligently” and treasure learning in all fields, including the study:</p>
<p>“Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms” (D&amp;C 88:79)</p>
<p>President McKay expounds on the expansive scope of the Lord’s curriculum at the groundbreaking. He incorporates these verses again three years later in the dedicatory prayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the dedication he asserts that education is a spiritual imperative, and not merely an economic one, as useful and important as learning to make a living most assuredly is. Learning helps us not simply get a job, but become more like God. An educator himself, President McKay clearly loves learning. His founding addresses and prayers exude love, excitement and passion for education, which at its finest lifts and enlightens and helps us become like God, whose glory is intelligence.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for us at BYU-Hawaii today? It means that we should inculcate love of learning here in <em>every</em> subject we teach. We should nurture life-long learners. We should teach students <em>how</em> to learn and inspire them to <em>want</em> to continue learning. At this institution, life-long learning is more than an academic catch-phrase or response to the marketplace, which requires workers who can keep up with rapidly changing fields. It is an eternal principle of the restored gospel. As Brigham Young said:</p>
<p>“We might ask, when shall we cease to learn?&nbsp; I will give you my opinion about it: never, never . . . We shall never cease to learn, unless we apostatize from the religion of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>It turns out this seemingly impractical, idealistic, gospel-based approach to learning that President McKay advocated has practical advantages in today’s world. Let me illustrate by citing a formula from the book <em>The World is Flat</em> by Thomas Friedman. Friedman uses the metaphor of a flat world to describe globalization in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, when we everyone and everywhere are potentially connected at any time. He calls this condition a flat world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The first, and most important ability, you can develop in a flat world is the ability to ‘learn how to learn’ [he says]—to constantly absorb, and teach yourself, new ways of doing old things or new ways of doing new things. . . . Because what you know today will be out-of-date sooner than you think.”</p>
<p>The qualities that equip you for a flat world are what he characterizes as curiosity and passion—or what I have designated more broadly as the love of learning. Friedman has a simple but memorable formula to express this idea. It is this:</p>
<p>CQ + PQ &gt; IQ</p>
<p>This translates as Curiosity Quotient plus Passion Quotient is greater than Intelligence Quotient. Friedman asserts:&nbsp; “I live by the equation CQ + PQ &gt; IQ.&nbsp; Give me a kid with a passion to learn and a curiosity to discover and I will take him or her over a less passionate kid with a high IQ every day of the week.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>So would I! There is good news here for you and me. We can become a curious, passionate learner no matter what our IQ. So please do not judge or limit yourself by past test scores or grades, nor focus excessively on these measures of your education. Instead, determine to become a passionate, curious learner. This will not only open doors opportunity; it will become a happier, more fulfilling way to pursue your education than worrying about who is smarter or who has the highest GPA. And ultimately it will help you fulfill the measure of your creation. For God invites us to love him with all our minds. As we come to know and love truth, we become more like Him.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Higher Than Intellect</span></p>
<p>Now let me turn to character education, the second large theme woven throughout President McKay’s founding statements.&nbsp; As a boy, I often heard President McKay teach that “character is higher than intellect.” &nbsp;I thought that he coined this phrase, though in fact he borrowed it from Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom he calls the “wisest American from an educational standpoint.”&nbsp; Even so, it became identified with President McKay for me as a boy. It was through the prophet of my youth I learned that [quote]</p>
<p>“True education consists not merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature or art, but in the development of character.”</p>
<p>Or as he put in another more positive way:</p>
<p>“True education seeks to make men and women not only good mathematicians, proficient linguists, profound scientists, or brilliant literary lights, but also honest men with virtue, temperance and brotherly love.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, true education produces noble character. This is the genuine gold that President McKay prophesied would distinguish the men and women “this school was going to produce.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ideal was profoundly inspiring to me as a boy starting my college education. I wanted to become a man “who cannot be bought or sold . . . genuine gold.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This must ever remain our aim at BYU-Hawaii. Students, you need to know that we have designs on your souls and not simply on your minds. We are not only about helping you <em>know some things</em>. We aim to help you <em>become</em> <em>something</em>—something noble and good.</p>
<p>So how does one acquire good character? Aristotle taught that character comes from our habits. It comes from choosing to do the right thing—often in small ways—over and over again until that virtue becomes habitual. It becomes who we are.</p>
<p>The word “character” originates from the notion of engraving or imprinting something, whether on the soul (as in a person of strong character) or in writing on a page (as in a character of the alphabet on a page). In both cases, character denotes what is etched deeply on the person or the page. True education engraves nobility on the soul.</p>
<p>What will you engrave here on your soul? What will you learn here not only in your head but in your heart? What will you become? We hope you will become individuals of noble character, “genuine gold.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can know if you are developing a noble character by evaluating what you truly love or treasure. Jesus taught that “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also”; the person who loves light and truth becomes “full of light.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.21-22?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Matt. 6:21-22</a>) “If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67?lang=eng#66" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:67</a>). Character education involves learning to love light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ancient philosopher Plato once asked the question “Who is a truly just or virtuous person?” He answers that it is the person would do what is right even if he or she were invisible. He illustrates this by the story of a man called Gyges, who like Frodo, entered a cave and found a magic ring that makes him invisible. But Gyges he uses its power to do evil. Plato concludes that Gyges, who had seemingly been a good man before this, was not truly virtuous. He just lacked the opportunity to do evil. The just man acts virtuously even if he were invisible.</p>
<p>So must we if we would become genuine gold. We must do the right thing <em>even when no one is looking</em>. We must never lie or cheat, <em>whether or not we might be caught</em>. We obey the commandments and follow the Honor Code <em>because we are men and women who keep their word</em>. Those of high character “scorn to violate the truth.” They “cannot be bought or sold.” These rare individuals are “genuine gold.”</p>
<p>They know that there is no ring of Gyges; that it is Satan who teaches the lie that we can hide from God. Our deeds are always visible to His all-seeing eye. Therefore men and women of genuine gold “walk as in His presence, ever to observe his providence”—knowing that we truly always are in His presence.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, though this will surely embarrass her, I want to hold up my wife as a role-model to you of such a person whose character is genuine gold. She is a person that Lord can trust because she strives to do the right thing in all circumstances. She does so because she truly loves the Lord and she loves the truth. She is like Nathaniel of old, a person in whom there is no guile, a person with an eye single to God. I love her just this side of idolatry.</p>
<p>As we start this semester, let us remember the gospel ideal of education. May we study not only diligently but with delight, treasuring this opportunity to learn, and pursuing our education with passion and curiosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we also remember that character is higher than intellect? Let us strive to etch nobility of character deeply into our souls.</p>
<p>Paul told the Corinthians that the gospel must be etched into “the fleshy tables of the heart.”&nbsp; In so doing, the Corinthian saints would become “our epistle” [or letter] to a fallen world in which the gospel could be “read of all men.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/3.4,%203?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">2 Cor. 3: 4, 3</a>). May we, too, become a letter of hope to a dark world lacking in virtue that Latter-day Saints are people of learning and light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In so doing, we will fulfill the vision of President David O. McKay when he dedicated this campus.&nbsp; He prayed:&nbsp; “May there radiate from these buildings an aura of light . . . influencing all to live clean and upright lives, to seek truth diligently, to be inspired . . . to glorify Thee, our Creator, our Father, our God.”</p>
<p>I echo this prayer for the campus today. May we learn in the light, may we come to love light, and may the light of God radiate always from our lives, growing “brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">D&amp;C 50:24</a>)&nbsp;</p>
