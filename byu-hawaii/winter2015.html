<p>Aloha and good morning. I am thankful for this opportunity to speak to you this morning and pray that something I say will help you on your path through life. I am grateful for President Wheelwright and for all he does for this university and for each of you.</p>
<p>I attended BYU–Hawaii over 36 years ago. I was a freshman here in 1978. I owe every good thing that has happened to me in life to this institution.</p>
<p>In 1969, while visiting family here in Hawaii, my family and I attended the Polynesian Cultural Center. A few years later in 1975, I was visiting again and decided to visit the Center as well as the BYU&shy;–Hawaii campus. While I was a non-member at the time, I remember thinking to myself, “I’m going to come here, I’m going to perform at PCC, and I’m going to attend BYU–Hawaii.” I don’t think I even thought about the fact that the PCC and BYU–Hawaii was owned and run by the Church. There was just something about this place that caught my attention.</p>
<p>My family and I later joined the Church as a result of a couple of missionaries coming to our home in 1977. I was a senior in high school. I’m sure that when the missionaries received their mission calls and read where they were assigned they must have said, “New Jersey?” Today, when missionaries from my stake are called to various places in the mainland, I sense their disappointment. I tell them about my conversion and that in 1977, two missionaries came to our house in New Jersey. Six of the seven members in my family were baptized by two elders from Utah. We were sealed as a family in the temple. My two sisters and myself have married in the temple, and we have families now. I served a mission in Oregon and stand before you today as a result of two young men who decided to accept a call to serve in New Jersey. A few months after my baptism, I received my patriarchal blessing. In that blessing, there were promises made to me that in the near future, men would come into my life and that I should be aware of this. They would teach me the gospel and tell me what I would need to be a faithful member of the Church. Little did I know that a few months after graduation, I would find myself here at BYU–Hawaii, dancing at the Polynesian Cultural Center. While here at BYU–Hawaii, there were men who came into my life who were great examples to me, and they taught me the gospel. These men either already went on missions or were going on missions. Many of those men are bishops and stake presidents today. It was here that I decided to serve a mission following my freshman year after having been a member for only two years. I had a good bishop that asked me to serve a mission. Since I was so new in the Church, I initially said I wouldn’t serve, but because of the influence of those promised men who came into my life, I changed my mind and decided to serve my mission after my freshman year. I’m certain that wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t come here and if I hadn’t met those men who became my friends. I also met my future spouse at PCC. Here, I met great friends – I increased in faith and testimony that set me on the correct path for the rest of my life. I had a wonderful mission president who mentored me and gave me leadership opportunities that would help me later in life to serve in many capacities in the Church. So to each of you, be grateful you are here, and ponder on what you are to learn here in addition to your education.</p>
<p>This morning, I would like to share with you something I wish that I had figured out many years ago when I was your age. The topic I would like to speak about with you today is how <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pondering</span></em> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">r<em>eflecting</em></span> can enrich your life, how it can help you receive revelation and inspiration to strengthen your faith in the gospel, and how it can even help you in your chosen profession.</p>
<p>Rene Descartes was a French mathematician and a philosopher, who lived from 1596 to 1650. He contributed to many modern ideas, mainly those associated with science and the scientific method. He developed a design for an improved telescope and mapped the pathway of nerves from the eye to the optical center in the brain and traced the path of pain receptors from limbs to the brain. One of the things that Rene Descartes is most famous for is <strong>the Cartesian coordinate system</strong> that is named after him. Perhaps some of you have used the Cartesian coordinate system in your math classes. What’s really interesting is how Descartes came to develop the Cartesian Coordinates – he was lying on his bed watching a fly!</p>
<p>Slowly, it came to him that he would be able to accurately describe the fly's position at any time by using three numbers. He had to use three numbers because the room was three-dimensional. The three numbers would describe the fly's position in relation to where it was to the floor and two adjacent walls. Today, this is known as the <strong>x-y-z</strong><strong> coordinate system</strong>. Most modern cities are laid out in Cartesian fashion: if you tell a stranger to go three blocks down Bishop Street, then turn left on King Street, and go along five blocks, you are actually using Cartesian coordinates. If you have been lost in an old town or even in new developments, you will understand how useful the Cartesian coordinate system is. The system is used by the military and rescue services (as well as air traffic controllers and map makers) to accurately describe where to find people and places. As a mathematician, Descartes was credited with developing the system that still serves as the foundation for graphing some 350 years after his death.</p>
<p>Descartes discovered this as he <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pondered</span></em> and <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflected</span></em> on a simple thing – a fly. He was curious about how to describe its position.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Smith’s Example</strong></p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Smith had a similar experience, though it was spiritual in nature. Relating to his experience after reading James 1:5, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “I reflected upon it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; … At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.12,13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Joseph Smith History 1:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>This experience happened to the prophet Joseph Smith because he took the time to <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ponder</span></em> and <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflect</span></em> on what he was reading and acted on his impression concerning something he really needed wisdom about and had a great desire to know. Pondering and reflecting is not just a passive activity but one in which you have to act, do something, and not just think about something – otherwise, nothing happens. Joseph Smith’s experience began the long awaited Restoration of the gospel and changed the world forever. You and I are benefactors of the prophet Joseph Smith’s experience.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph F. Smith</strong></p>
<p>A similar experience happened to the prophet Joseph F. Smith. In the Doctrine and Covenants section 138, he describes an experience he had after reading the First Epistle of Peter in the third and fourth chapters. “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison” (quoted in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.7,8?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 138:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>President Smith said, “I sat in my room <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pondering</span></em> over the scriptures; And <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflecting</span></em> upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.1-2?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">D&amp;C 138:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>What came next was the vision he received about the spirit world: How Christ organized righteous individuals and appointed them to teach the gospel to those in the spirit world. He saw many of the great and noble servants, Father Adam, Mother Eve, Abel, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and many others. This all because he <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pondered</span></em> and <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflected</span></em> on a scripture he read and sought an answer.</p>
<p><strong>My Experience</strong></p>
<p>Years ago, I made the commitment to attend the temple on a weekly basis. I thought to myself that if I was going to attend the temple weekly, I needed to change the way I approached my temple attendance. The temple endowment, like the scriptures, doesn’t change each time we read them. However, what can change is our understanding and impression we get as we read them. I thought to myself that I could either go through the motions every week and yes, I would fulfill my goal of attending the temple weekly, but this wouldn’t be spiritually fulfilling even though I was in the house of the Lord. I decided that if I was going to attend the temple that I would focus on things I heard and saw, focus on every word and everything I saw!</p>
<p>As I attended the temple with this new approach, words began to stand out to me. I would <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ponder</span></em> and <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflect</span></em> upon those words, and revelation would come to me about their meanings. I felt renewed and excited as I began to understand many of the mysteries I had wondered about for years. Now when I go to the temple, I’m excited every time I go and wonder, “What will I learn today? What revelation will I receive today?” The result has strengthened my faith, and I have a much deeper relationship with the Savior.</p>
<p>Just a couple of months ago, as I sat pondering over a few things about the temple endowment, another revelation came to me, something I had wondered about for more than 30 years! It came to me as a result of my study of the scriptures since I was preparing for a priesthood meeting. My study of the scriptures actually prepared me to receive a greater understanding of the things I saw and learned in the temple.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, there is so much more you will learn in the temple through revelation than you will ever hear or see – just study the scriptures and prepare before you go. I’m sad to think that many of us members of the Church will never reach this level of temple worship. Perhaps, we will now because we are here today and will make that decision to study and prepare before we go to the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Does it work in the business world?</strong></p>
<p>Some years ago, I was working with an elderly couple. He was 80 and she was 79. He came to me with a dilemma. He had limited assets but needed more income to provide for his retirement. He was a pretty sophisticated individual and knew a lot about the bond market, especially the junk bond market. He approached me to look for some junk bonds, and for those of you who are unfamiliar with these types of investments, they can be the most risky way to invest in bonds. Given his age and the potential for loss of his principal, I didn’t feel comfortable recommending these types of investments to him. My education taught me to ask questions, so I gathered as much as I could about his whole financial situation. I asked him more questions about his liabilities, real estate holdings, and other assets he might have. With this information, I knew a lot more about his financial position, and I was armed with the information I needed to find a better solution than the one he was suggesting.</p>
<p>As I <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflected</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>on his situation, the answer came, and I was able to provide the needed extra income for him plus allow him and his wife to take a trip around the world, which is something he had wanted to do but lacked the assets to do. A few years later, his wife died, but I was grateful I could apply this principle I learned while attending the temple.</p>
<p><strong>First, it takes preparation.</strong></p>
<p>Receiving inspiration to life’s question takes preparation. Descartes would not have received the inspiration he received if he had not prepared himself for the inspiration to come. He spent many years studying and learning and had a curiosity about how the world worked around him. He was prepared for the inspiration that day as he was pondering over how to describe the location of a fly.</p>
<p>So the next time you are tempted to do the least amount of work to pass a class or skip the extra work a professor gives you, don’t do it. You will only handicap yourself later in life. You will lack the knowledge and wisdom for inspiration to work in you. You cannot, when the time comes, plug a USB memory stick into your head or Google it or find it on Twitter or any other website.</p>
<p>The Lord cannot inspire you if you lack the knowledge. My ability to solve my client’s problem came from my education, professional courses, and training provided by my firm. The Lord said, “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 109:7</a>). Spiritual growth takes place as we draw close to God through prayer, scripture study, pondering, and obedience.</p>
<p>Nephi taught, “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, <em>feasting</em> upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19-20?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>Feasting to me means that you are enjoying everything. It’s so good you want to partake of everything; you can’t get enough of it. You wish you could keep eating, but your body says you’ve had enough. This is such an important principle for you to remember and practice in your life.</p>
<p>In Malcolm Gladwell's book <em>Outliers</em>, he says, “Researchers determined what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: 10,000 hours. Ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert – in anything.”</p>
<p>There is no silver bullet or easy way to achieve the level of preparation that you will need. Your education here is just scratching the surface. You will need to continue to study and learn throughout your life.</p>
<p>John A. Widtsoe once said, “Decide what you want to be, pay the price, and be what you want to be.” The Lord will provide ample opportunities for you to practice your skills. They often come in the form of trials and adversity. Be grateful for them and learn from them and allow them to make you stronger and deeper rooted in the gospel.</p>
<p>You had an opportunity to listen to General Conference last weekend. Take the opportunity to listen to every talk. It has never been easier to listen to the apostles and prophets from our laptops, our smart phones, desktops, etc. Perhaps, in some ways, it has never been harder given all of the distractions we have with those same devices. It is part of that preparation you will need to receive inspiration and revelation in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Second, slow down.</strong></p>
<p>You live in a world that moves at lightning speed. Technology has been a blessing in many ways. However, it can also be a distraction.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, we had one phone in the house it was a rotary phone. There was no speed dialing or favorites like we have on smart phones today. Look how your generation communicates today. No one calls anyone anymore; you don’t even use email that much. You text each other. You don’t even use real words anymore. If I were to ask you what LOL, BTW, BCNU, or BFF stood for you would know.</p>
<p>The problem with this type of communication, while convenient and cool, is that it doesn’t lend itself to pondering and reflection. They are just letters. It’s one of the reasons why daily scripture study is so important to you. Not only are you reading actual words, but as you read the words, impressions can come as you focus on words. Thoughts can come which lead to deeper testimonies and greater faith. This is feasting upon the word.</p>
<p>One day, I was leaving my office for an evening event for work. As I was driving along Ala Moana Blvd, it was the time of day that the sun was going to be setting within the next 15 minutes. The sky was clear and the ocean beautiful. Most times, I would hurry to my meeting, not taking time to appreciate the beautiful place in which we live. This particular day, I decided to pull off the road and into a parking lot where I could get out of my car and stand on the shore and watch the sun set. I stood there appreciating the beautiful place that we live in and gave thanks to my Father in Heaven for creating it. The picture is still as vivid in my mind today as it was when I originally saw it.</p>
<p><strong>Third, be present.</strong></p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I happened to be visiting another ward in a stake on the mainland. I arrived a few minutes before the meeting started. The chapel was full due to a couple of returning missionaries and so chairs were set up in the cultural hall to accommodate everyone. As a stake president, I always sit on the stand, maybe oblivious to what is actually going on in the congregation. As I sat in the back, I noticed everyone around me was either on their smart phones or iPads, looking at Facebook or scores on ESPN, texting, sending emails, or playing video games. To make matters worse, they weren’t even church games. I was disappointed and shocked. Perhaps some of you may be tempted to do some of these things right now.</p>
<p>We sang the opening hymn or at least tried to, but I was the only one singing in the back and felt out of place, so I stopped singing. As the sacrament was passed through the congregation, they didn’t skip a beat. One quick grab at the bread and they were right back to their previous behavior. As I sat there, I reflected on this experience and about those around me that just missed one of the most sacred ordinances we can experience in the Church. The sacrament is a time to ponder the previous week and reflect on the things that we need to improve. It is a time to express gratitude to the Savior for His Atonement and to remember Him. Being present does take effort and work. To help you be present and avoid distractions, keep a note pad or some other device so that when thoughts come into your mind, you can write them down so that you don’t forget them. This will allow you to stay in the moment.</p>
<p>You will find if you make a concentrated effort to continually increase your knowledge, slow down and take time to reflect and be present, life will be much more fulfilling. You will be able to solve problems you may have at work or be able to answer questions you may have about gospel subjects.</p>
<p>I’d like to bear my testimony of the gospel, that Joseph Smith helped restore the gospel to the earth, and that we have a prophet leading the Church today under the direction of the Lord. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>March 31, 2015<br />Blake Vaaulu, Sery Kouma Kone, Marc Gardner<br />BYU-Hawaii Student Association Presidency<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blake Vaaulu: "Our Great Purpose"</span></strong></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I know that each and every one of us here at BYU-Hawaii is here for a purpose.&nbsp; Many of us here can attest to this, many of those who came before us do. Yet there are many others still to come who will attest to how being here at BYU-Hawaii was no coincidence.&nbsp; There are lessons to be learned and joys to embrace through experiences in our short time here in BYU-Hawaii that we could not possibly have anywhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This place is special. These grounds that we walk on every day have a unique history and an even more unique destiny.&nbsp; In a speech by Lance D. Chase here in BYU-Hawaii, there is mention of accounts that indicate Elder McKay, at the time before becoming President, wanted a “temple of learning to complement the House of the Lord already in existence a few hundred feet away…” Calling what would later be this beloved University a “temple of learning” denotes an “attitude of reverence… consistent with that found in scripture.”&nbsp; I, like President McKay, am “deeply grateful for the ideals of the church of Jesus Christ in education.”</p>
<p>The Lord, in the years of the Restoration, revealed to Joseph Smith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77-80?lang=eng#76" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 88:77-80</a>):</p>
<p>“And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;”</p>
<p>Notice how we will always be given enough to know for ourselves what is true.&nbsp; It may not be all that the Lord knows, but I believe it will always be enough for us to reach the next checkpoint where the Lord will give us further guidance, for we are counseled to learn “line upon line, precept upon precept” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">2 Nephi 28:30</a>). This university is distinctive because we integrate secular learning in an atmosphere that prioritizes the Spirit. &nbsp;“Teach ye diligently…that you may be instructed…in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77?lang=eng#76" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 88:77</a>)</p>
<p>The Lord goes on to say that we must seek to understand: &nbsp;“things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth” (geography, biology and, here in BYU-Hawaii, surfing); “things which have been,” (history, or in our business department, accounting), “things which are,” (arts or, for business majors, economics), “things which must shortly come to pass” (in business, we call that finance); “things which are at home, things which are abroad,” (social work); “the wars and the perplexities of the nations,” (peace building) , “and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms” (political science, or in business operations). This is my favorite part:&nbsp;“That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.79-80?lang=eng#78" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 88: 79-80</a>)</p>
<p>This brings us once again to our purpose, to the mission with which he has commissioned us, to be “men (and women) of a sound understanding” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Alma 17:2</a>).&nbsp; This place is so special, but more special, are the people that it is designed to bless: you, me, all of us (and in turn others that we will bless).&nbsp; President David O. McKay prophesied “that from this place…will go men and women whose influence will be felt for good towards the establishment of peace internationally, genuine gold.”&nbsp; Oh, what a blessing it is to be part of that prophesy.</p>
<p>At the dedication of the Aloha Center, Elder Marion G. Romney uttered these words that I feel apply to the university as a whole,</p>
<p>Oh God, bless the youth that come here, that they may be inspired, that they may carry on various activities… in such a way as will help them grow in faith and power, that they may be representatives of thee on the earth, to reach out and touch as far as possible all mankind with the influence of thy Spirit and the knowledge that thou dost live and that Jesus is our Savior.</p>
<p>In a recent fireside with President Callister and President Wheelwright, they reminded us, once again, of the importance of our being here as students today, saying that, “He (the Lord) sent us here (to BYU-Hawaii) because he knows that things we need in the future, we can learn here.”</p>
<p>I must admit that there are times where I have personally found that my attending here was hard and confusing.&nbsp; I can recall certain periods of my time here as feeling pointless. Though inevitable, may we never stoop to such feelings and thinking permanently.&nbsp; It is at these times, in retrospect, I have come to understand as moments where, “man doth not comprehend all things which the Lord can comprehend.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">Mosiah 4:9</a>). In these moments, we only see half of the story that is being written for us by our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>While attending church here, I had a concerned bishop who tirelessly would remind us of the blessing it was to be able to attend the Lord’s university.&nbsp; He would expound to us that “each of you are not here by accident.”&nbsp; Let me add my testimony to his by saying, yes, each and everyone one of us is not here by mere coincidence.&nbsp; I believe that we have been lead here today in preparation for when the Lord will need us to be leaders, men and women of honor that are guided by the same spirit that resonates throughout this campus.</p>
<p>I love this campus.&nbsp; I have come to know many great people while being here and I love you all. I have met people here from all backgrounds who have been moved by the blessings of coming here. I know that those of you who have opened your hearts to “this place” share the same love I have for BYU-Hawaii. This place is indeed a hallowed ground meant to instill within us tools to “accomplish the things which the Lord hath commanded” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">1 Nephi 3:7</a>).</p>
<p>In closing, I leave with you certain words of the charge given to President Wheelwright at his inauguration, and see it as the charge to be given to us when we leave BYU-Hawaii.&nbsp; It goes,</p>
<p>“I confer upon you the authority, the prerogatives, and the responsibilities associated with this high and sacred office. I charge you to lead… to new heights of service, achievement, and recognition as is unique to this institution. You follow and enhance a tradition of striving to achieve visions of great possibilities seen by prophets of God. It is given as a gift to you with confidence that you will meet the sacred trust…”</p>
<p>Oh, how great is our purpose here as students of BYU-Hawaii. This I know to be true in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sery Kouma Kone: "Tender Mercies"</span></strong></p>
<p class="Normal1">Aloha Brothers and Sisters,</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">My standing here today is a miracle. I am humbled by this opportunity and pray for the Spirit to assist me as I address you today--that the Spirit will teach all of us according to our individual needs.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Exactly three years ago, my wife and I arrived at this university full of joy and dreams. It was quite an accomplishment to be finally accepted at BYU-Hawaii after three unsuccessful attempts. But, we soon realized that the journey was not going to be easy as we soon became aware of the challenges and difficulties ahead of us. The language barrier was obviously the primary one. It was literally impossible, at the time, for me to make a complete and correct sentence in English. We walked out of our first sacrament meeting asking ourselves if we were at the right place. Yet, three years later I am standing here at a campus devotional giving a talk in English! It is a miracle!</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">I would like to begin by honoring my dear wife. When we met 5 years ago, I was poor, alone, and my future was uncertain. All I had were my dreams and the desire to work hard to achieve them, but she willingly joined me in my eternal journey. I want her to know that I am grateful for her support, love, patience, and hard work. Without her, nothing would have been possible. She has been my faithful companion and partner every step of the way. To our 11-month-old son, I would like to say how much we are grateful to have him in our lives. He is a giant spirit, and the responsibility to raise him is both an honor and a privilege. We love him so very much.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">My life is full with what the scriptures refer to as “the tender mercies of the Lord.”</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">I was born and raised in Cote D'Ivoire, West part of Africa. In the course of my life, I experienced what is called child slavery. After a family tragedy, I found myself working in cacao farms to survive.&nbsp; I began working when I was 6 years old and worked 10 hours a day clearing weeds with machetes, planting seeds, harvesting beans, and carrying heavy loads on my head and back. I did this for 6 years. It was a difficult and painful experience. Every day was the same. We learned to live each day as if it was our last.&nbsp; I eventually escaped and was able to have gone to school, met the missionaries, joined the Church, served a mission, and then was married in the House of the Lord. These blessings came because of so many “tender mercies of the Lord.”</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Nephi declared: “But behold I will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom He hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">1 Nephi 1:20</a>)</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Elder Bednar elaborated on the word “chosen” mentioned in the verse we just read.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">We may falsely think that such blessings and gifts are reserved for other people who appear to be more righteous or who serve in visible Church callings. I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are available to all of us and that the Redeemer&nbsp;of Israel is eager to bestow such gifts upon us. To be or to become chosen is not an exclusive status conferred upon us. Rather, you and I ultimately determine if we are chosen.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">He continued:</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">God does not have a list of favorites to which we must hope our names will someday be added. He does not limit “the chosen” to a restricted few. Rather, it is our hearts and our aspirations and our obedience which definitively determine whether we are counted as one of God’s chosen. (Bednar April 2009).</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">For example, Mormon was quick to observe and sober–probably the reason the heavy responsibility to gather the records fell on his shoulders. Joseph Smith was courageous and ready to stand for his beliefs, qualities that certainly made him the “chosen” to lead the Restoration. He faithfully withstood oppression, persecutions, and faced death with no compromise. The greatest example of all made no exception: “not my will, but thine be done.” The question for you and me is, where do we stand in our relationship with God? What are we doing to be among the “chosen”? Have we taken advantage of the precious spiritual and intellectual opportunities that this special place has to offer?</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">This university was built to prepare us to become God’s chosen. Are we willing to take this responsibility or are we too busy with other things? If we are not careful, we could miss the purpose of being here. Here is a video I want to share to illustrate my point:</p>

<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Are there ways that we are living like the man on this ship?&nbsp; We are blessed beyond measure with the privilege of attending this great university, in this beautiful place.&nbsp; There are blessings waiting for us just outside our door, if we will walk hand in hand with the Savior. Of course, we all have challenges and struggles as we go through school. From failed exams, difficulties to understand some of the materials, and Church responsibilities, the challenges are the same, but we can all take comfort in the promises of the Lord. In<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/40.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank"> Isaiah 40 verse 31</a>, we read, “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Like me, the fact that you are here may be a miracle in your life. I hope and pray that we will all strive to live up to our potential and privileges, and recognized the tender mercies in our lives.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">In closing, I’d like to acknowledge the friends I have made who have influenced my life. I have been given great opportunities to learn, serve, and grow from their examples and friendships. Thanks to all of you my fellow students, my teachers and mentors.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">I also want to thank the two teams in which I have been involved. Our BYUHSA leadership team and our Enactus team. You have all helped me live up to my privileges and opportunities and added so many tender mercies in my journey here. You are all my heroes, and I am grateful for everything you have done for me.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Like the people of Jared when they arrived at the promised land, the scriptures tell us:&nbsp; “And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the earth, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/6.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Ether 6:12</a>)</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpLast">In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>It was many years ago that David O. McKay had a vision of what this marvelous place of La’ie would become in the future. After he attended a small ceremony, he stated, “I witnessed a flag raising ceremony by students of the Church school here in Hawaii in La’ie. In that little group of students were Hawaiians, what do you call them — Haoles, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Filipinos. We listened to each one, a representative from each of these groups, pay tribute to the stars and stripes as the flag was pulled up there on the flagpole and all vowed allegiance. That ceremony brought tears to my eyes. Truly the melting pot…” - David O. McKay</p>
<p>It is important to understand the period of time in which this vision had taken place. In 1918, WWI had just ended and the world was in a rebuilding state. David O. McKay, a young Apostle, had been charged to go and visit the nations and take peace. That flag raising ceremony gave hope that all, as children of God, could work together and get along in peace and harmony.</p>
<p>Look at us today. Over 70 countries are represented on this very campus. The PCC and La’ie Temple bring in thousands of visitors to be exposed to our beliefs. Every day, busloads of people get taken to the mural of the flag raising ceremony and exposed to the vision of this little town and what it represents. This small place is truly bringing people together from all over the world. In President McKay’s words, “What an example in this little place of the purposes of our Father in Heaven to unite all peoples by the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>How is it that we are united? What is the common denominator? Is it the gospel? This school? Our culture? While pondering these questions, I was reminded of a few experiences that help me to understand.</p>
<p>I was visiting a friend on the west side a few weeks ago. We had plans to swim with dolphins, as we both loved water photography. I had visions in my mind of the bright sun and crystal clear blue water with hundreds of dolphins swimming around me. I was imagining the perfect shot of a dolphin spinning out of the water and a baby dolphin close behind with the sun raging in the right of the picture, and a perfect rainbow to top it off. I was stoked. I woke up early, traveled out there for this perfect moment, looked for the dolphin boats as they were an indication of where we needed to be.&nbsp; But there were none, and it was overcast and raining.</p>
<p>My friend Alika, in his humble pigeon accent, said, “Braddah Marc, why are you bummed? If you only look for the perfect moments in life, you have lost your passion for the ocean. Have faith. Mother Nature always provides, even in bad conditions.”</p>
<p>He was right.&nbsp; We got in the water and, even though I didn't see what I wanted, we were still blessed with beautiful water, fish, honu and a shark. It was a great day. As we were leaving and dropping my friend home, he said, “Marc, thank you for adding value to my life.”</p>
<p>This statement has had a profound impact on me; it was so deep. How is it that I added value to his life?&nbsp; I was the negative one and he was the one who I felt added so much value to my life with what he had been teaching me, with his example of faith and a positive attitude.</p>
<p>In that same week after pondering this statement, I took a family shark diving off Haleiwa. I was surprised, as when I meet groups, it is usually students, but in this situation, it was a family. The father was one of the nicest people I have ever met. He genuinely wanted to know about my life by asking sincere questions. He was excited at my life’s plans, at my hobbies, interests and what drove me. He even asked about my family and what they did. He constantly smiled all day and continued to show his appreciation for the great time we had. His son was sick on the boat and I observed him looking after him to make sure he was okay–a great example of a father’s love. He displayed these same genuine attributes of wanting to know about other people’s lives to all on the boat. His positive attitude, smiling and genuine interest was infectious. I honestly believe if it was stormy and a horrible day, he still would have displayed, in my opinion, perfect gratitude. A few days later he rang me up and gave me a gift card for my favorite eating place and homemade brownies. He truly added value to me and I bet to many more people he comes in contact with. I will always remember that man and the impact he had on my life that day.</p>
<p>What was it about these two experiences that stood out to me: someone giving me one of the nicest compliments and teaching me about faith and positivity, despite my negative attitude, and a man so radiant and full of life leaving an impact on me like that? The answer is the light of Christ and the love of God.</p>
<p>The Savior teaches us, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Matthew 5:16</a>)</p>
<p>And furthermore, we read in Moroni, “For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Moroni 7:16</a>)</p>
<p>These two experiences helped me to understand the light that is in all of us, member of the church or not. Every person has the capacity to leave a positive impact on someone else–that all of us can help those around us to be happy. I know and believe that this is what President McKay saw and felt during that flag raising ceremony, tender experiences of human beings adding value to the lives of those around us. And again today, look at the value the small 2,800 students, few hundred staff and faculty, and tiny country community are leaving with the world. We truly are letting our light shine before men.</p>
<p>Last week, I had the privilege to attend a Family Home Evening with Elder Callister and students from the South Pacific. It was in this meeting an important doctrine was explained to me that helped me understand the light we have. Elder Callister asked us to think about this statement, “What is not quite right about this belief that other people believe, the belief that we were created by God?” I thought this was a bold statement because are we not created by God? He then went on to ask, “Can a painting become the painter? Or can the photograph become the photographer? The answer being simple, no.”</p>
<p>He went on to explain that, “likewise if we were just created by Him we could never become like Him, but we know from the Bible that we are the offspring of God, and that means we all have his DNA, a part of him in each of us.”</p>
<p>This, then, changes our relationship with Him and those around us. Each one of us has the ability to display the wonderful attributes that our loving Heavenly Father has. Think about that, you and I can do that. Heavenly Father loves you and me so much that He adds immense value to our lives through the characteristics we all share that are from Him.</p>
<p>I am not sure about how much value I have left with you, but I know about the value you have left with me. You all have strengths, whether you believe it or not. You all have characteristics of Heavenly Father and, while I do not know you all personally, I have seen it and felt it while being on this campus surrounded by you.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to speak to those whose lights are dimmed by struggles, stress, temptations and burdens. And I, too, have been there many times. The Lord loves you. Sometimes we have the expectations of what we want out of life and we do not get that, or, through our choices, fall short of what is required of us and the Lord’s promised blessings. Like the story of my perfect day on the west side, you may have had the perfect picture in mind, shown up, and not gotten it, but the Lord will always give us something better–something that is needed for us in the very moment we need it. Our time here at BYU-Hawaii is the time to seek the help we need to overcome the challenges we face, to regain the light that is dimmed, to understand our divine relationship with our Father in Heaven, to continue to be a light and add value to those around us.</p>
<p>I know and promise you that no matter what you are going through, no matter how much pain you feel, no matter how big the sin is, whatever is dimming your light, that in the words of Paul, “Nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</p>
<p>We have countless missionaries, Bishoprics, Stake presidencies, Relief Society presidents, Elders’ Quorum presidents, school counselors, teachers, professors, mentors, community members and fellow students all around us who are here to help us. Do not feel alone.</p>
<p>President Monson stated, “My dear sisters (and this applies to brethren, too), your Heavenly Father loves you—each of you. That love never changes. It is not influenced by your appearance, by your possessions, or by the amount of money you have in your bank account. It is not changed by your talents and abilities. It is simply there. It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God’s love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve love. It is simply always there”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify to you all that God’s love is real and that it is always there. I know and believe in all of us, that we can add value to the lives of those around us! I know that we are a bright light to the world and are fulfilling David O. McKay's vision of becoming genuine gold. Let us use this time to become that promised blessing and lay hold of the light we have been blessed with. I know Christ lives and this is His school, and that this is His Gospel. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>March 24, 2015<br />Shayne M. Bowen<br />of the Seventy<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I would like to share with you today something that has changed my life. It is very personal to me. I hope that some of you will go away today and follow the council that I will give you. I believe that if you do, years from now you will be able to look back to this meeting as the meeting that changed your life forever. As taught in Doctrine and Covenants section 43, I hope that you will go home and “bind yourself to act in all holiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">D&amp;C 43:9</a>).</p>
<p>Let me ask you two questions. First, is God a planner? While you think about that, let me ask a second question. In the creation of the world, how many creations were there? Some of you are thinking six, some are thinking seven, and some are thinking countless. And some of you are not even thinking. We can go to <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.4-5?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Moses 3:4-5</a> to find the answer. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I, the Lord God, made the heaven and the earth</p>
<p>“And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>We learn from this scripture that when the world was created there were two creations: first the spiritual and then the physical. Which of the two creations do you think was more difficult to perform, the spiritual or the physical? My personal feeling is that the spiritual creation would have been the more difficult. Why? Because it required pondering, creativity, and a vision. When it was time for the physical creation, the Gods knew exactly what the world would look like. They had seen it and created it spiritually beforehand. They had seen and planned for it in the spiritual creation.</p>
<p>Why does God send missionaries out to teach the world how to return home to Him? Why would He have put an entire chapter on planning in Preach My Gospel? What is God’s motivation in all of this?</p>
<p>He has clearly stated His purpose. His work and His glory are to bring to pass the immortality and the eternal life of each one of us, or in simple terms, He loves us and wants us to return home. Eternal life means God’s life, the life He has. Can we really receive all that the Father hath? Absolutely! He has promised us that very thing. The Savior taught, “And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">D&amp;C 84:38</a>).</p>
<p>In order to return home, it requires planning. That way, life doesn’t just happen, but rather, we can act and direct much of what goes on in our lives.</p>
<p>I love this quote from Elder Ballard in chapter eight of Preach My Gospel:</p>
<p>“I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.”</p>
<p>Believe that God is a planner and that if we want to become like Him and return to live with Him, we need to do what He does. This requires us to have a vision, it requires us to make a plan, and it requires that we set goals.</p>
<p>God has a plan for you. He has given us a timetable to follow; specific events should take place at specific times. Strive to stay on God’s time table. For example, if you are old enough to be a priest, be ordained to be a priest. When mission time comes, be on a mission. When marriage time comes, get married. When child bearing years come, bear children. One of my favorite scriptures is found in Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>“To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>
<p>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</p>
<p>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
<p>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
<p>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
<p>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
<p>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
<p>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.”</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/eccl/3.1-8?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>)</p>
<p>As a young missionary in Chile, I had the great privilege of serving the Lord for two wonderful years. In that time, I learned how to pray. I learned what it means to plead with my Father in Heaven. I learned that He really does love me and that He really is my Father. I learned to recognize the Holy Ghost as He would guide and direct me. I learned that He would warn and comfort me in my hour of need. I learned that He truly is the testifier of the Father and of the Son and that anything God wanted me to do was possible. I learned that Jesus is the Christ and that His Atonement is for me. I learned that through the Father’s plan, with Christ at the center of that plan, that I could return home to my heavenly mansion and once again live with Father and Jesus Christ. I learned that families really are forever.</p>
<p>My mission was the hardest thing that I had ever done in my life up until that point. Just before I came home, I had an experience in a cold, dark prison cell where I didn’t know if I would ever see my family again. For the first time in my life, I faced the real possibility that my life would be taken, but that is a story for another day. The blessing of that horrific experience was that I learned very clearly by the power of the Holy Ghost that God loves me and that living His plan is all that matters.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t trade the experiences that I had and the knowledge that I gained as a full-time missionary for anything or, for that matter, for everything that this transient world has to offer. I was blessed to see clearly where I wanted to go and what I needed to do.</p>
<p>Young men, if you have not served a mission, serve one. You know you should. The Holy Ghost has already told you that. If you are not worthy, repent and get worthy. Prepare yourself and follow the counsel of a living prophet of God. I promise you that you will never regret it. It will bless you, and it will lay the foundation for your eternal life. Sisters, I along with a prophet of God, invite you to serve.</p>
<p>After my mission, I was blessed with a beautiful, virtuous woman who was full of love for the Lord and for me. At that time, I felt that I needed to have a written plan for my life. As a young father with a young family, I knew that I wanted to be a well-rounded person. I felt that God had taught me what that means.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this devotional, I said that if you would follow the counsel that I give you today, I believe that years from now you will be able to look back to this devotional as the meeting that changed your life forever.</p>
<p>Well, my counsel to you is that you create a written plan for your life. The best way for me to teach you how this can be accomplished by being very personal and sharing my own experience with you.</p>
<p>I would like to open to you a window to my soul. I want to share with you what I did when I was 23-years old and let you into my thought process as I wrote my life plan and then have tried to live that plan. Almost 40 years later, I can say that my life has changed forever because of my life plan.</p>
<p>I wanted to incorporate into my life plan what I considered to be the three most important aspects of a meaningful life. I wanted to be a “whole man.” Each person may have different feelings and ideas about what that means. That is the great blessing of the individuality that God has given each of His children, but for me those, three aspects or supporting legs of my life were God, family, and work.</p>
<p>I realized that in order for my life to be meaningful and everlasting, God had to be at the center of everything that I did. I also realized that there is no lasting happiness without family. And finally, I realized that if I were going to be happy and be a blessing to my family and others, I needed to be self-reliant financially, which translated into work.</p>
<p>As I set out to conquer the world and myself, I thought of a few things that I wanted to always remember, thoughts and quotes that would keep me grounded and on course and that would help me remember where I was headed. I wrote down these axioms and quotes which became an important part of implementing my written life plan. They are as follows:</p>
<p>I wrote my plan based on the personal values that would guide my future decisions. If my values were right, I knew that by setting short- and long-term goals based on and around those values, I would be able to become the person that I aspired to be and that person would be pleasing to my Father in Heaven. That is who I am still striving to be: a son of God who is loved and who is pleasing to my Father. I hope that one day as I return home with my family that Heavenly Father can say, “This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p>I felt empowered as I realized that I could go anywhere I wanted to go, that I could achieve anything that I wanted to achieve. The sky was the limit, and I was in charge.</p>
<p>How did I start this life changing process? In the spirit of prayer and meditation, I read and re-read my patriarchal blessing. I paid attention to the blessings promised and the talents which God said I had been given. Sometimes, I would think, “Is He talking about me?” But I decided that if He said I had such a talent that I had better develop it.</p>
<p>I also paid attention to the warnings and admonitions that I was given. I was grateful that a loving Father in Heaven would warn me of possible pitfalls in my path.</p>
<p>If you don’t currently have your patriarchal blessing, seek to have a desire to receive one and then worthily go to your patriarch and receive this wonderful road map for your life. I testify that these blessings come directly from God and that He has many wonderful things to tell you to assist you as you travel through this life.</p>
<p>Then I identified eight values that I wanted to develop in my life. Today, chapter six in Preach My Gospel on Christlike attributes would be a great place to study to help you receive the revelation you are seeking. Then fast and pray to know if this is who God wants you to become.</p>
<p>I suggest that you choose between eight and ten values. In my thinking, if you have more than that, the task can appear so overwhelming that your resolve probably won’t last long. With eight to ten life values, you will be able to keep a razor focus and become the person that God and you want you to become.</p>
<p>I then thought about the person that I wanted people to remember when I am dead. This is called seeing the end from the beginning.</p>
<p>I asked myself what are the things that I want my family and friends and business associates to say about me at my funeral. This helped me realize what is really important in this life and what really isn’t.</p>
<p>The next step, which may be the most important of all, was to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">write down</span> the values that would govern my behavior for the rest of my life. You have heard it said that if it is not written down, it is only a fleeting wish. I was committed, and I had a document to remind me of that commitment for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I then began to carry a copy of my written life plan with me wherever I would go, and I would review it often. I would set short- and long-term goals in my life based on these values. I carry with me today and review often the very document that I wrote nearly 40 years ago. It still guides my life. It describes the person I want to become.</p>
<p>Now the very personal part. I am going to share with you today my life plan. If you choose to create your own life plan, I don’t expect that your plan will be the same as mine. In fact, it shouldn’t be because we are each unique creations of God. My hope is that you would be able to see an example of my plan, which would help you develop and write down your own unique plan for life.</p>
<p>With each of the eight values that I chose, I wrote down positive affirmations. I wanted to describe the person I wanted to become. As I reviewed on a regular basis those affirmations, I realized that my life was changing and that I was starting to be more like the person I wanted to be. As already mentioned, even today, I have not become the person I hope to become. I am a work in progress. I believe my best days are still ahead of me and that I am slowly but surely becoming the person that God expects me to be and the person that He sent me here to become.</p>
<p>Those positive statements over the years have become to me just like the scriptures and my patriarchal blessing. I believe my life plan is an inspired document that God revealed to me many years ago. Writing my plan was a spiritual experience for me.</p>
<p>I can’t number the times that I have been faced with business situations, personal relationships, or temptations where lines from my life plan have come quickly to my mind and helped me to make the right choice. We really are the product of our choices. My life plan has been and still is a great blessing and a protection to me on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Along with the positive affirmations, I chose scriptures that teach and model the value that I desire.</p>
<p>I will now share my eight personal values together with the positive affirmations and scriptures associated with each one.</p>
<p>My eight values are</p>
<p><strong>1. Spiritual</strong></p>
<p>I am a spiritual person.</p>
<p>I recognize the Lord in all aspects of my life.</p>
<p>I pray with real intent morning and night personally.</p>
<p>I pray over our meals and with my family each morning.</p>
<p>I read the scriptures daily for at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I always have family home evening with my family.</p>
<p>I fast with real purpose each month.</p>
<p>Spirituality is on the top of my priority list.</p>
<p>“Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">D&amp;C 6:36</a>)</p>
<p>“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">Matthew 6:33</a>)</p>
<p><strong>2. Intellectual</strong></p>
<p>I am an intellectual person with an insatiable desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>I read at least one book each month unrelated to my fantastic insurance business.</p>
<p>I take the time to write down and look up words that I don't use or fully understand.</p>
<p>I keep sharp in my business by pursuing professional designations and regularly reading the trade magazines.</p>
<p>“Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">D&amp;C 130:18-19</a>)<em></em></p>
<p><strong>3. Physical</strong></p>
<p>I am an athletic 190 pounds.</p>
<p>I eat good food and never overeat.</p>
<p>I do 50 pushups and 50 sit-ups daily.</p>
<p>I enjoy being healthy, never get colds and am full of energy.</p>
<p>“And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; And shall run and not be weary and shall walk and not faint.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.18-20?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">D&amp;C 89:18-20</a>)<em></em></p>
<p><strong>4. Charitable</strong></p>
<p>I am a charitable person.</p>
<p>I believe the golden rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe in the win/win philosophy: "If you win, I win."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that "As ye sow, so shall ye reap."</p>
<p>All of my business, as well as personal decisions, are made with these three axioms in mind.</p>
<p>I always ask the question, "What would the Savior do?"</p>
<p>“Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.4-7?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>)<em></em></p>
<p><strong>5. Cleanliness</strong></p>
<p>I am a clean person.</p>
<p>In appearance, body, mind, and habitation.</p>
<p>I am physically clean.</p>
<p>I put everything in its place.</p>
<p>I am clean in mind.</p>
<p>I haven't time to clutter my mind with trash.</p>
<p>I think clearly and fill my mind with virtuous thoughts and lofty ideals.</p>
<p>“Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">D&amp;C 132:8</a>)<em></em></p>
<p><strong>6. Patience</strong></p>
<p>I am a patient person. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in command of my emotions at all times.</p>
<p>I don't raise my voice.</p>
<p>I reason with my children and others, rather than intimidating or forcing my will upon them.</p>
<p>“A soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/15.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Proverbs 15:1</a>)</p>
<p>“A wrathful man stirreth up strife; but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/15.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Proverbs 15:18</a>)</p>
<p>“He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/16.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Proverbs 16:32</a>)</p>
<p><strong>7. Positive</strong></p>
<p>I am a positive person.</p>
<p>I maintain a positive attitude always.</p>
<p>I am an eternal optimist.</p>
<p>I love a new challenge and look for the best in all people and situations.</p>
<p>I believe in people.</p>
<p><strong>8. Integrity </strong></p>
<p>I am a person of impeccable integrity.</p>
<p>I have the moral courage to make my actions consistent with my knowledge of right and wrong.</p>
<p>“Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/27.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Job 27:5</a>)</p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters. Where do you want to go? Plot your course. The power is yours.</p>
<p>I testify that you are literally sons and daughters of God. He knows you, and He loves you. He wants you to come home. He has provided every needful thing to allow you to return home clean and prepared to receive all that He has.</p>
<p>He has given us His only begotten in the flesh even Jesus Christ to atone for our sins and mistakes and to be there to succor us in our afflictions. He is our redeemer and our savior. He is literally the physical and spiritual son of God. He is unique; only through Him can we return to the presence of the Father.</p>
<p>God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ visited the prophet Joseph in this the dispensation of the fullness of times. Joseph was and is the prophet of the Restoration. Let the world rail on the prophet Joseph. It makes no difference. They are only fulfilling prophecy. I know him to be a prophet of integrity and courage. He is a covenant keeper. I know this not because I have met him but because I have read the Book of Mormon. I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the book is true.</p>
<p>God’s power, which is the Holy Priesthood, has been restored to the earth, and the power to become like God and to receive all that He has is once again upon the earth. That power is manifest in the holy temples of God.</p>
<p>I testify that there are living prophets, seers, and revelators again upon the face of the earth and that there is one, even Thomas S. Monson, who holds all priesthood keys and has authority from God to exercise those keys. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>March 17, 2015<br />Tad R. Callister<br />Sunday School General President<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Jaime Escalante had a well-paying job at a computer company until he resigned to become a high school teacher. As fate would have it, he was assigned to Garfield High, located in the slums of East Los Angeles, California, not far from my hometown. There, he would teach basic math.</p>
<p>A movie based on his life shares a scene in which the principal is meeting with teachers and other school administrators. The principal reminds them that the school is on probation because of its academic failures. One of the teachers present mentions that the only way to have higher test scores is to move the school out of the slums, in other words, move the school to a place where rich kids live. Another chimed in that you can’t teach logarithms to illiterates. Finally, after a moment of silence, the newest teacher, Jaime Escalante, spoke up: “The students,” he said, “will rise to our level of our expectation.”</p>
<p>One then sees him teaching in the classroom. It is obvious that he is no ordinary teacher. One sees hope being planted in the eyes of his students for the first time – maybe they can not only pass math but even master it.</p>
<p>At one of the subsequent administration meetings, Jaime Escalante announced that he wanted to teach calculus the next year at Garfield High. The only way the juniors could prepare for it, however, was to have them take trigonometry and advanced algebra in summer school. The other teachers and administrators were shocked at such a suggestion. “That’s ridiculous,” said one, “our kids can’t handle calculus.” Then he added, “There are some teachers in this room who can’t handle calculus.” But Jaime Escalante was not to be discouraged or derailed – he had incredible faith in the potential of these young people and a vision of what they might become. Finally permission was granted. Upon announcing to his students that they should enroll in summer school, he heard remarks such as, “We will be seniors – it will be our year to slack off.” But somehow, these students knew deep down that this was their chance, their opportunity to rise to heights never before achieved in their lives.</p>
<p>After a difficult summer of sweltering classrooms, Jaime’s faithful students returned to their senior year to confront the difficult subject of calculus. At one point, one of the frustrated young men said, “Everybody knows I am the dumbest. I cannot do calculus.” Jaime responded, “Do you have the desire?” The boy said, “Yes.” That was enough. He stayed on.</p>
<p>Finally, the moment of truth came for these students to take the high school advanced placement test. If they scored a 3, it meant they qualified for college credit; if they scored a 4, they were well qualified; and if they scored 5, they basically scored the equivalent of an A for college credit. By way of background, this calculus test is so difficult that only a small percentage of all U.S. high school students ever attempt it.</p>
<p>With great anxiety, eighteen students took the test and then with equally great anxiety waited for the results. To their great delight and amazement, all eighteen students received college credit. It was miraculous. No other school in Southern California had so many students qualify. But then a problem arose; those who had administered the test thought the students must have cheated. The scores were substantially above those of any other school. Surely, they thought, this would be impossible from such a school as Garfield High, located in the slums of East L.A. This stigma hung over the students until finally each agreed to retake the test, this time with as much additional supervision as the school district desired. They did retake the test. Anxiously, they waited for their test scores. Finally the scores were given to the principal over the phone – 4, 5, another 5, 4, 3, 4 – all eighteen students again had qualified for college credit. It was a resounding victory for vision and faith in the human soul. It was a great reminder that the youth in the humblest barrios of East L.A. could rise to the same heights as those in the private and expensive schools of Beverly Hills. Why? Because they all had the same common denominator – they were all children of God with equally divine potential.</p>
<p>The movie concludes by putting on the screen the number from Garfield High who passed the advance placement test in subsequent years:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1983 – 31<br />1984 – 63<br />1985 – 77<br />1986 – 78<br />1987 – 87</p>
<p>What made the difference? The vision of one teacher and the determination of students who made no excuses along the way.</p>
<p>Some might think that education is only a temporal or secular goal, but that would be a serious misconception. Academic excellence is a religious pursuit. The scriptures tell us that “it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">D&amp;C 131:6</a>) and further that “if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">D&amp;C 130:19</a>). Some never seem to grasp this verity; they envision sharp dividing lines between the religious and secular, when in truth religion circumscribes all truth regardless of its origin or discipline.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Brigham Young admonished the Saints, “Learn everything that the children of men know. Every true principle, every true science, every art and the knowledge that men possess, or that they ever did or ever will possess, is from God.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Brigham Young was echoing the words of the Lord that we should learn “Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.79?lang=eng#78" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:79</a>), and then the Lord added “that ye may be prepared in all things” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.80?lang=eng#79" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:80</a>).</p>
<p>Without minimizing our educational experience, President Eyring put it in perspective: “It is clear that our first priority should go to spiritual learning. For us, reading the scriptures would come before reading history books. Prayer would come before memorizing those Spanish verbs. A temple recommend would be worth more to us than standing first in our graduating class.&nbsp; But it is also clear that spiritual learning would not replace our drive for secular learning. … On the contrary, it gives our secular learning purpose and motivates us to work harder at it.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;And what is that purpose? It is to become more like God in our character and in our intellect. That is our vision and our goal.</p>
<p>It was July 4, 1952. Florence Chadwick, who had previously swum the English Channel, now attempted the twenty-one mile swim from the southern California mainland to Catalina Island. The water was a freezing 48 degrees. The fog was thick and visibility almost nil. Finally, only a half mile from her destination, she became discouraged and quit. The next day reporters clamored around her asking why she had quit. Had it been the cold water? The distance? It proved to be neither. She responded, “Yesterday, I was licked by the fog.” She then recalled a similar experience while swimming the English Channel. Evidently, the fog was likewise engulfing. She was exhausted. As she was about to reach out for her father’s hand in the nearby boat, he pointed to the shore. She raised her head out of the water just high enough to faintly see the shoreline ahead. With that new vision, she pressed on and swam the English Channel.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;This story teaches a great truth—with increased vision comes increased motivation.</p>
<p>A correct vision of education motivates us to be better students and more focused learners. As the divine offspring of God, we have the power to become like Him. That is a staggering thought, a glorious thought, a profound thought. As we better understand our potential destiny, our level of self-worth and confidence and motivation is greatly heightened. We will understand that it is shortsighted at best to take easy classes and easy teachers, rather than ones that will stretch us toward Godhood. We will catch the vision that it is Godhood, not grades, for which we are striving.</p>
<p>The story is told of the king who wanted to master geometry. He called before him his finest advisor to teach him the subject. The teacher taught the king some basic principles and left him with some homework. When the advisor returned, he discovered the homework was undone.&nbsp; The king responded that he did not realize such mental effort would be required. “Is there not an easier way?” he inquired. Then came the sobering reply: “My majesty, there is no royal road to geometry.” Likewise, there is no royal road to the mastery of any academic or spiritual subject. It takes hard work and persistence. Does anyone believe that it is possible to become like God, the creator of worlds ad infinitum, without the botany skills to create plants, or the engineering know how to design earths, or the mathematical acumen to set in motion the orbit of planets, or the artistic appreciation to bring beauty and aesthetics to our handiwork? Someday, we will have to pay the price to master these disciplines. There will be no magic wand that will freely bestow that knowledge upon us. At some time, it will dawn upon us that every day, every class is a critical part of our eternal schooling.</p>
<p>No doubt you recall the story of Peter walking on water. As he saw the surging waves, he started to lose faith and began to sink. The Savior extended His hand and said, “O thou of little faith” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/14.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">Matthew 14:31</a>). I have often thought to myself, “How many other men do you know who had the faith to walk on water, even for a few steps?” But the Savior was not comparing Peter to other men; He never does that. In truth, He was saying, “O ye of little of faith compared to what you can become.” Our Father’s expectation of each of us is that we do become like Him, intellectually as well as spiritually.</p>
<p>Some years ago, while serving as the President of the Toronto Mission, I had a 6’7” missionary from a small town in Arizona assigned to our mission. We encouraged our missionaries to memorize scriptures every day. This missionary, just off the farm, said, “I can’t do it, President. I can’t memorize.” I replied, “Just work on one sentence at a time.” Being obedient, he did his best. In our final interview, I said to him, “I understand you have now memorized over 50 scriptures.” He responded with a smile, “No, President – over 70 scriptures.” In truth, our capabilities have no limitations because God has planted within each of us the seeds of Godhood. His divine DNA is in our spiritual composition.</p>
<p>We had another missionary assigned to us from the United States who struggled in school and had been assigned to speak Spanish. At the beginning of his mission, he approached me several times and asked me to transfer him to an English-speaking area. I reminded him that he had been called to speak Spanish, but the repeated requests still came. One day, he was in the mission office and started eating one of the cookies that was in a jar on the table. He was there with several other missionaries. I asked him if he knew how to say cookie in Spanish. He replied “No.” I said “Elder, there is a new rule for you. From this day forward you cannot eat it or wear it until you can say it in Spanish.” One of the nearby elders remarked, “You are going to have a hungry, naked elder on your hands.” I replied, “No, I am going to have an elder who learns Spanish.” I can’t say that he ever became the preeminent Spanish speaker in our mission, but he did learn the language sufficiently to teach many investigators in Spanish, to baptize in Spanish, and to become a district leader of a Spanish district. He went home a new man, learning that his capabilities had far exceeded his initial expectations.</p>
<p>As I was about to leave for college, my older brother gave me this wise counsel: “Tad,” he said, “Always take one more unit than you think you can handle.” That advice stretched me and helped elevate my college experience.</p>
<p>Education has been and always will be the great equalizer for men and nations. It helps eliminate poverty. It prepares youth to be better-qualified missionaries. It produces parents more able to bring culture and refinement into the home; it provides someone with the skills and knowledge to pursue a vocation that can be both rewarding and economically viable, and it can nurture and enlarge the leadership and teaching skills of church members. But most importantly, education will help us in our pursuit of Godhood. It will help us become like Him who is all-knowing, and thus, in the ultimate sense, our quest for academic excellence is a religious pursuit.</p>
<p>What then can we do to enhance our educational experience and to improve as students? First, we can listen carefully and take notes in class and elsewhere. It takes some energy and effort, but that is part of the price tag of learning. If you have not developed that habit, you should do so now. As a young man, S. Dilworth Young was attending a conference at which a number of church leaders were present. During the course of this meeting, he noticed an older brother on one of the last pews. He was sound asleep, with his head back, his mouth wide open. Brother Young then noticed a skylight immediately above this gentleman’s head. The thought went through his mind that if he could climb to that skylight, he could drop wads of paper into the man’s mouth and give him the shock of his life. As terrible as the thought was, he said that it nonetheless preoccupied his mind for the rest of the meeting. Finally the meeting ended, the benediction was offered, and all arose to leave. Brother Young found himself behind a man who was obviously touched. This brother turned to the man by his side and said, “Wasn’t that a spiritual feast we had today.” Brother Young then said to himself, “Dilworth, where were you when the feast was being served?”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Feasts are regularly served in classes, in Sacrament meeting, and in many other locations, but in many cases, we leave fasting rather than feasting. Fortunately, you can correct this. You can listen more carefully; you can take meaningful notes; you can ponder and share what you have learned; you can be a more attentive student.</p>
<p>Second, you can study in a place of quiet solitude, an hour of quiet time is worth several hours in front of the TV. Some subjects demand meditation and pondering to become their master. Third, you can take challenging teachers and courses. An easy teacher may be nice and a good friend, but if he or she does not stretch your mental capacity and strengthen your spirituality, then he or she is not yet a great teacher. I had a friend at school who only took easy teachers because he wanted good grades. He completely missed the point of his education. He was living only for today, completely failing to grasp the eternal implications.</p>
<p>Fourth, you can ask questions in class and to your roommates. Questions are often the precursor to knowledge and revelation. It was a question that triggered the first vision, a question that triggered the word of wisdom, a question that triggered the glorious revelation on celestial marriage. Reach outside your comfort zone, ask questions, and be a full participant in classroom discussions.</p>
<p>And fifth, you can be observant. Ammaron informed Mormon when he was but 10 years of age that he would one day be entrusted with the gold plates. Then he gave one of the reasons for this selection: “I perceive … thou … art quick to observe” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Mormon 1:2</a>). You too can be a nonstop student—quick to observe—not just learning in class but at mealtime or in conversations with friends. President Hinckley was a prime example of this.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I spoke with Sister Sheri Dew who wrote the biography on President Hinckley’s life. She mentioned that he was a voracious reader of newspapers, the Harvard Classics, anything that was good and ennobling. He could converse with the chairman of the Federal Reserve at one moment and the guy installing your plumbing the next. Whether at dinner or elsewhere, he had a string of unending questions. After doing this for so many years, and by the time she met him, she felt he was conversant on most any topic.</p>
<p>Elder Russell Nelson spoke of observing President Hinckley at a regional conference: “One of the security officers assigned to us worked for the local police department. We had time between sessions, and President Hinckley grilled that officer for an hour about their procedures, techniques, and even the equipment they used. I marveled that he knew which questions to ask, each of which was law-enforcement specific.” Elder Robert D. Hales adds, “I have never met an individual who can become so well informed through reading and through contact with people. When he spends an evening at dinner with someone, he leaves knowing something about that person’s expertise.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>President Hinckley embodied the invitation found in the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Thirteenth&nbsp;Article of Faith</a>: “If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.” There is much to be learned, not only in the classroom but also outside its boundaries. How many times in the scriptures have we been enjoined to seek out of the best books words of wisdom? I will never forget reading Hawthorne’s “The Great Stone Face” and being reminded of the eternal truth that we become like those things which we habitually love and admire.</p>
<p>Recently, I finished the biography of a man who served as director of central intelligence, ambassador to the United Nations, vice president, and eventually president of the United States. In reflection upon his life, he said that the three greatest titles he ever held were husband, father, and grandfather—those words cemented in my mind and heart the transcending role of family.</p>
<p>I have always loved poetry and tried some on my own but, unfortunately, without much success. Who is not uplifted by the words of Milton or Shakespeare or these words of Elizabeth Barrett Browning:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. <br /> I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br />My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight.<br />I love thee with the breath,<br />Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, <br />I shall but love thee better after death.”</p>
<p>We ought to become familiar with the great poets and even memorize some of their soul-stirring lines.</p>
<p>The world of music can be a celestial realm in and of itself. Who is not touched by Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony or Handel’s Hallelujah Chorus? With angelic choirs the Lord chose to announce the birth of the Savior to the shepherds. Heavenly music has the power to lift us, to soften our hearts, and to facilitate our receptivity to spiritual things. We ought to become familiar with and develop a taste for inspiring music that is so readily available to us all.</p>
<p>The world of art can appeal to the depths of our emotions. In my den, I can see Washington kneeling by his horse in times of great tribulation praying for the birth and survival of our country; I can see the portrait of Lincoln whose very countenance radiates faith in God and integrity of soul. In my office, I see the picture of the Savior agonizing in Gethsemane and the angel strengthening him before he takes it all upon himself – alone – totally alone. How could that visual not inspire love for Him who gave His all for us? How many young people have pictures of the temple in their bedrooms, as President Kimball and President Monson have suggested, reminding them to be pure in heart, so they might enjoy the sacred and sublime blessings of the temple.</p>
<p>As we immerse ourselves in the scriptures, good books, poetry, music, art, and the like, we refine our spirits, so they are more keenly sensitive to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. This too is part of our education. May we all broaden our horizons beyond the classroom. May our education be more than a school pursuit, may it become a life-long quest. What a golden opportunity to avail ourselves of the cultural programs on campus, the lectures, the musicals, and dramas. Do not let them pass you by. May we seek after everything that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy. May we come to know that academic excellence, including cultural refinement, is a religious pursuit. It accelerates our path to Godhood—the ultimate aim of the ultimate education.</p>
<p>I bear witness of a loving Heavenly Father and our capacity, as His children, to become like Him as we pursue our expanded education with diligence, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>March 10, 2015<br />Mark B. Cannon<br />Dean of the College of Math and Sciences<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I vividly remember babysitting my four little sisters one afternoon when I was about 12. I was downstairs watching TV, like the conscientious babysitter that I was, when I heard my sisters in the kitchen upstairs excitedly calling out a word that sounded like "stickers!" I shrugged and went back to watching my Transformers cartoons (this was the 80's). Soon, however, it became apparent even to me that the word they were calling out in such joyous chorus was, in fact, "sugar." I quickly investigated and found that my sisters had discovered mom's five-gallon bin of white sugar and were flinging armfuls into the air in delirious ecstasy. The kitchen was a winter wonderland, and my sisters looked just like little sugared donuts. Interestingly, what took them maybe five glorious minutes to create took me hours to clean up. By the way, if any of you kids out there ever encounter a similar situation, and you end up wondering if you can just sweep all that sugar off the floor and back into the bin without mom noticing... Yeah, she's going to notice.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak about entropy: spiritual entropy. I’ll ask my students not to cringe. Entropy as a concept is simple enough to understand because you experience it every day. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thermodynamic Definition of Entropy</strong></p>
<p>Physicists in the 1800s realized that any time energy is used to do work, some portion of that energy is unavoidably lost as heat to the surroundings. For example, if you use a hand pump to fill your bike tire with air, some of the energy you expend is wasted in warming up the pump and the tire. When you peddle that bike, a significant portion of the energy you use goes to overcoming friction, which dissipates that energy as heat, warming up and <strong>disordering</strong> your surroundings.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Understanding entropy allows chemists and physicists to predict directionality and spontaneity in chemical reactions and other physical processes.</p>
<p>You see entropy in a more general sense in the observation that your room always seems to get cluttered, dishes are always waiting to be washed in the kitchen, the floor always needs sweeping, your desk is always a mess... and all of this happens without any extra effort on your part. It's just a side effect of living your life; in order to accomplish anything (like making a sandwich or brushing your teeth), you end up disordering your surroundings. A consequence of this is that you have to expend a significant amount of your time and effort cleaning up after yourself, reorganizing your surroundings and your tools at least enough so that they remain useful.</p>
<p>Entropy means disorder. The natural tendency of all things: <strong>Nature</strong>. It is the unavoidable part of all energy expenditure that is unavailable for work.</p>
<p>For example, I enjoy woodworking. I have a modest little shop set up in my tiny garage at home. Usually, when I begin a new project, I cannot just start building. I must do some work to reverse the entropy that has accumulated since the last project before I can begin because the workbench is covered in wood scraps and tools; there are boards and papers and manuals and drill bits and wrenches and car parts and (because this is Hawaii) beach sand all over every available surface. Once I’ve organized things enough that I can start my project, I must regularly take time to reorganize and clean so that I can continue making progress on my project.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>As a proud father of three little girls, I have ample evidence that kids are amazing little entropy machines. The sheer magnitude of disorder they generate hour by hour, minute by minute, is just staggering. They delight in making messes and thrill in creating disorder. The “sweet” experience with my sisters that I shared at the beginning of my address is just one example. Just a few minutes of simply following their natural inclinations resulted in the generation of huge amounts of entropy. The mess was easy to make, but the cleanup required far more time and concerted effort.<sup><a href="#4">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Entropy is the unavoidable and natural tendency of all systems toward disorder. The only way to reverse this tendency is to access an outside source of energy. Living systems, like the human body, do this by taking in high-energy, low-entropy fuels from our surroundings and expelling low-energy, high-entropy wastes (like CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) to our surroundings. In this way our bodies are able to grow and organize and maintain order, keeping entropy low at the expense of increasing the entropy in our surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Biology Is a Battle Against Entropy</strong></p>
<p>To help us understand how hard our bodies have to work to overcome entropy so that they can function I’d like to “zoom in” and focus on some details. Hemoglobin is a protein found in your red blood cells. Its job is to transport oxygen from your lungs to your tissues in your brain, muscles, etc. That might sound like a simple task, but it is actually quite complicated. You see, if hemoglobin just simply latched on to oxygen molecules in your lungs, then it wouldn’t do us much good. It has to be able to release the oxygen at the right time and in the right place. In order for hemoglobin to tightly bind to oxygen molecules some of the time but not at other times, it must be exquisitely designed to be sensitive to its environment; acidity, carbon dioxide, chloride, O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and even altitude affect the behavior of hemoglobin. It also has to be very specific in its binding preferences: it can’t stick too tightly to other similar molecules. It must remain soluble in your blood and function well in very tight quarters. And, it must accommodate all of these specialized functions quickly and efficiently without using up too much of your cells’ resources. All of this requires that hemoglobin be an exquisitely tuned machine with many moving parts. It is composed of 9,272 atoms. Each of these atoms has a specific position within the protein where it needs to be in order for hemoglobin to function properly. A modern automobile has about 10,000 separate parts, so in some ways, you can think of hemoglobin as being of similar complexity. And, just like a car, if some of those parts go bad or are removed, the machine won’t function properly. For example, sickle-cell anemia is a terribly painful and debilitating disease that is caused by a genetic mutation to one of the genes that encodes hemoglobin. This inherited mutation changes only about seven of hemoglobin’s almost 10,000 atoms but has a devastating effect on the ability of hemoglobin to do its job.</p>
<p>Each of your red blood cells contains about 280 million copies of hemoglobin<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup><strong>,</strong> and we estimate that each person has roughly 20-30 trillion red blood cells<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup><strong>,</strong> so that means you have about 8 x 10<sup>21</sup> hemoglobin molecules in your blood stream (that’s an 8 with 21 zeros after it). It’s hard to comprehend the magnitude of that number, so let’s think of it this way: If you had a magical expander machine that could expand the size of objects, and you blew up all of the hemoglobin molecules from just one person to the size of a miniature marshmallow (a million-trillion fold magnification) and then took all those hemoglobin molecules and spread them out evenly, you could cover the entire surface of the earth to a depth of about 16 meters (53 feet) in hemoglobin marshmallows.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> Another example: if you took just the carbon atoms from all your hemoglobin (2,952 carbon atoms per molecule), you would have about 480 grams of carbon total. That’s about a cup of carbon in the graphite form. Now, since we seem to have magical abilities, let’s take that handful of carbon atoms and string them together, end-to-end, in a single atom-wide line. Though you wouldn’t be able to see this line of carbon atoms with even the most powerful (light) microscope, you could stretch that line all the way out the door and down the road to the PCC… then on over the mountains to Honolulu, then out over the ocean, past China, past Europe… all the way around the world, and then out into space past the moon, past Mars, past Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and all the way out to Pluto. And back. 300 times.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> My point is that there are lot of atoms (and they are very, very small) just in that one kind of molecule in a body.</p>
<p>And hemoglobin is just one of 20,000 or so different kinds of proteins in the human body. We haven’t even mentioned RNA, DNA, lipids, polysaccharides, and thousands of other kinds of molecules that you find in each of your trillions of cells in your body. And, of course, as any biologist will tell you, the whole is far more than the sum of its parts. Clearly, the human body is a wondrous creation of almost infinite complexity; a beautiful gift given to us so that we can be a part of God’s plan here on Earth. However, with that gift, God has given us the commandment that we take care of it because without proper nourishment, the right temperatures, clean air, exercise, etc., our bodies start to lose the battle with entropy, and all that mind-boggling complexity begins to break down. We get unhealthy, we die, and entropy wins.</p>
<p><strong>Applying the Concept of Entropy to Spiritual Things</strong></p>
<p>Spiritual entropy is essentially the same thing as the physical entropy we’ve been talking about but in a spiritual sense – the tendency of our spirits to drift away from God and His commandments. This spiritual tendency is a consequence of our physical world and our physical bodies and the associated natural man tendencies. From King Benjamin’s sermon, we read,</p>
<p>“For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Naturally, that is, without our having to do anything extra, we drift away from God and become His enemies. James also mentions a relationship between the natural world and enmity with God:</p>
<p>“…know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The "world," by scriptural definition, is "natural" and prideful. Thus, we naturally tend towards spiritual disorder and away from God, toward the world and pride. This is entropy – spiritual entropy.</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson explained this eloquently in his talk on pride in 1989:</p>
<p>“The central feature of pride is enmity—enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. Enmity means ‘hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition.’ It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us.</p>
<p>“Pride is essentially competitive in nature. We pit our will against God’s. When we direct our pride toward God, it is in the spirit of ‘my will and not thine be done.’ As Paul said, they ‘seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/2.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Philippians 2:21</a>).</p>
<p>“Our will in competition to God’s will allows desires, appetites, and passions to go unbridled.”<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The <strong>only</strong> antidote to this tendency, as King Benjamin explains, is to "yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit" and to "become like a little child." Not childish but child-like, meaning humble and willing to submit to everything the Lord sees fit to inflict upon us.</p>
<p>Our natural tendency, meaning spiritual entropy, on the other hand, is to avoid difficulty and adversity. The Lord is asking us to embrace it, just as the Saints did in Helaman’s day:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>To yield something, as King Benjamin admonishes, is to give it up freely, meaning to give up our pride and our will. We have to let go of our body's needs and wants and let the Lord lead us through our spirits.</p>
<p>But, in Helaman, notice that the "yielding of their hearts" required quite a bit of work: fasting and praying and waxing their humility and firming their faith. So this "yielding" is nothing like a passive process. Much like reversing the sugary entropy in my childhood kitchen, we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work in order to push back the spiritual entropy that constantly pulls us away from God.</p>
<p>But also notice that yielding their hearts resulted in filling their souls with joy and consolation and the purification and sanctification (meaning spiritual cleansing and making holy) of those same hearts which they yielded up to God.</p>
<p>Now, back to King Benjamin's sermon, he tells us that we must yield to the "enticings" of the Holy Spirit. We know that the voice of the Holy Ghost is a still, small voice, so His enticings are easily drowned out in our minds by the noise of the world. The word "enticings" suggests something subtle – not "tempt" or "pull" or even "guide" but entice. Perhaps one of the reasons we have to work so hard to yield our hearts to God is that it takes so much effort to shut out the world and prepare our hearts and tune in our spirits, in other words reversing entropy, so we can start to detect the enticings of His still small voice.</p>
<p>Next, the verse says that after we yield to the enticings, we "putteth off the natural man." The footnote for this phrase points us to Alma 19:6, talking about King Lamoni's miraculous conversion:</p>
<p>“...the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness—yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away in God.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>I don't think that the word "natural" is used here accidentally. In this verse, I think the cloud of darkness and unbelief equates to spiritual entropy. That entropy was dispelled by God's light – glory, goodness, and everlasting life. This process overcame his natural frame, as in natural man. Light and darkness are used throughout the scriptures, and this dichotomy always represents God's influence and the lack thereof. Darkness really is nothing in a physical sense, just the absence of light. If spiritual entropy is darkness, then it is simply the absence of God's influence. And, of course, the way King Lamoni was able to have that darkness and unbelief cast away from his mind was through the “light of the glory of God.” The work we do to put off the natural man is simply opening our minds and spirits to this “marvelous light of [God’s] goodness.”</p>
<p>The laws of thermodynamics tell us the same thing about the physical world. The only way to make something non-spontaneous happen (like put off natural man) is to put in “free energy” from an external source (God's influence).</p>
<p>Accordingly, we must be constantly putting in spiritual energy in order to avoid the natural pathway, and there is only one source of that spiritual energy: God’s light.</p>
<p>That is why it isn't good enough to just stop doing bad things when we start to become converted; we must actively look for ways to bring the Spirit into our lives. This is part of the reason that we must regularly partake of the sacrament, serve in the temple, bear our testimonies, magnify our callings, feast from the scriptures, study conference talks, serve our neighbors, come to devotionals, etc. We are pushing back the darkness, battling entropy. The instant we stop working toward opening ourselves to the light, the darkness begins to creep back in.</p>
<p>Prophets also speak of this as nourishment: "man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.”<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> If we don't continually intake food (our source of free energy) into our bodies, then only the spontaneous, natural processes can occur, following the path of maximum entropy until we arrive at "equilibrium." Equilibrium is a term we use in chemistry to refer to the completion of the reaction process, where maximum entropy has been achieved and all useable energy has been expended. In living systems, equilibrium always equates with death. In a biochemical sense, a living cell must constantly intake energy sources (nourishment) to sustain life and stave off entropy. Otherwise, the chemical reactions that cause everything to happen in the cell proceed to equilibrium and then stop, and that’s death. Each of our cells is engaged in a life-or-death fight against entropy every second of every day. Our spirits follow the same principle: without a continual source of spiritual nourishment and order, we start to lose the battle against our natural man, and we begin to succumb to entropy. Without God’s light to sustain us, our spirits also proceed towards a stopping point: spiritual death.</p>
<p>Now back to King Benjamin. After we have put off the natural man in this way, then we can become “a saint." The footnote here directs us to the New Testament where Jesus admonishes Peter just before he went to Gethsemane: "But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> Being a saint implies conversion. According to the Bible dictionary, "saint" means holy, or without blemish, or one baptized into the church, so it isn’t until we’ve put off the natural man that we are able to become converted.</p>
<p>And then, finally, we see the driving force behind this entire process of change, the true source of our spiritual nourishment: "through the atonement of Christ the Lord." All this work we've done to yield to the Holy Spirit and put off the natural man and become a saint has opened up our spirits to the marvelous healing power of the Atonement. At the same time, the only way we have been able to do any of this is through the enabling power of the Atonement. An upward spiral of enabling allowing healing and healing allowing enabling. Elder Bednar has taught about these two complementary powers of the Atonement:</p>
<p>"I suspect that many Church members are much more familiar with the nature of the redeeming and cleansing power of the Atonement than they are with the strengthening and enabling power. It is one thing to know that Jesus Christ came to earth to die for us—that is fundamental and foundational to the doctrine of Christ. But we also need to appreciate that the Lord desires, through His Atonement and by the power of the Holy Ghost, to live in us—not only to direct us but also to empower us."<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, we are becoming a saint we are "becom[ing] as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father." King Benjamin points out what aspects of children we seek: humility, patience, and love – in other words, being willing to submit completely to the Lord, just like my four-year old who <strong>knows</strong> that mommy can fix any hurt or that daddy can protect her from anything.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the footnote for "submissive" in this verse points us to the topic "self-mastery" in the Topical Guide. Apparently being submissive requires self-mastery, probably because the submissiveness that we are talking about here isn't the just-do-what-you-are-told variety. We're talking about acceptance of the Lord's will, accepting hardship and adversity, appreciating difficulties and challenges, being willing to do whatever the Lord asks us to do. The world sees meekness and submissiveness as weakness, but anyone who has truly tried to adopt this scriptural form of submissiveness knows that it requires a significant amount of strength of will and determination.</p>
<p>And faith. Faith like the pioneers had.</p>
<p>Recently, my wife and I were able to take our family on a pioneer “trek” at Martin’s Cove in Wyoming. It was an exhausting but inspiring experience, pushing and pulling a handcart through the sand and mud and heat, and we only went a few miles. This experience helped me gain a deep interest in my own pioneer ancestors. I knew that some of my ancestors had come across the plains as pioneers, but I began to wonder how many pioneer ancestors I had and what their stories were. I admit to being less than attentive in Family Home Evenings as a kid when my parents taught about these stories, so a few months ago, I began to research through the Church’s FamilySearch tools. Of my 32 great-great-great-grandparents, I was amazed to find that 30 of them crossed the plains as pioneers between 1847 and 1869 in wagon or handcart companies. I have found dozens of amazing stories of their perseverance, dedication, and faith. For example, Lars Larsen was one of my great-great-great-grandfathers on my paternal grandmother’s side. He and his wife joined the Church in their native Denmark in 1867. Their family and friends immediately disowned them. They soon immigrated to America and joined a company of saints crossing the plains to Utah. When they arrived, they were so poor that they lived for two years in a hole in the side of a hill before they were able to afford to build a real house. Lars and his wife Johanne stayed true to the Gospel even after Lars had to spend time in jail for his beliefs. (Fortunately, he had some good company there. In this picture you can see him with his friend George Q. Cannon, after whom the Cannon Activity Center is named. Ironically, I’m only distantly related to Georgi Q. and not through my Cannon ancestors, despite the shared family name.) The faith and dedication of the Larsen family helped them keep spiritual entropy at bay so that they could find joy together even while literally living in a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf spoke about this light in the most recent General Conference:A little over a year ago, my wife and I traveled to Jiangxi, China to adopt a three-year-old, little girl. Our other two daughters were also brought into our family by the Lord through the miracle of adoption, but this was our first experience with an international adoption. This was not our plan. In fact, we were completely caught off-guard when the Lord let us know, in very clear terms, that He had prepared us and guided us into this adoption and that He meant Meizi to be our daughter. The last year has been amazing and miraculous for us to be able to witness the miracle of a little heart that had never known a family, or the light of the gospel, or the comfort of prayer, being warmed and brightened by the Spirit and the sweet love of a “forever mommy.” There is a light in her eyes now that wasn’t there a year ago. The light of family love and God’s love has pushed back the darkness and entropy of the world. In April of last year, we were able to take her to the temple to be sealed to her as part of our eternal family. This journey through endless applications, fees, certifications, paperwork, and interviews; and then on to a cold communist orphanage on a dark, rainy December day; and finally into the warmth and light of the Lord’s temple has been one of the most challenging experiences of our lives but certainly one of the most rewarding to be able to be a part of this miracle of light pushing back darkness. Because of the goodness and mercy of God – and I have to acknowledge my angel wife’s faith, determination, and prayers – there is one less orphan in the world, and our family is that much brighter and more complete.</p>
<p>“The Savior has told us in our day, ‘That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day’ (D&amp;C 50:24). The more we incline our hearts and minds toward God, the more heavenly light distills upon our souls. And each time we willingly and earnestly seek that light, we indicate to God our readiness to receive more light. Gradually, things that before seemed hazy, dark, and remote become clear, bright, and familiar to us.</p>
<p>“By the same token, if we remove ourselves from the light of the gospel, our own light begins to dim—not in a day or a week but gradually over time—until we look back and can’t quite understand why we had ever believed the gospel was true. Our previous knowledge might even seem foolish to us because what once was so clear has again become blurred, hazy, and distant.”<sup><a href="#16">17</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>The Purpose of a Fallen (Entropic) World</strong></p>
<p>We might feel to ask the question, "Why does God allow His creations to be subject to this decaying force, this entropy? Why must the world have so much darkness and unhappiness?" I am convinced that entropy is an eternal principle (at least in this fallen world). We know that there must be "opposition in all things"<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> in order for righteousness to be brought to pass. In fact, Lehi tells us that “if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>So, there was no entropy in this world before the fall! "All things must have remained in the same state" must refer to a world without entropy. God doesn't create corruption. Man had to turn the key by transgressing God's commandment to introduce entropy into our world. Lehi continues, “And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.”<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>It seems to me that the Fall allowed the introduction of entropy, both physical and spiritual, into God's creations. Entropy causes or allows corruption to enter our world and our physical bodies. What was created originally in perfection now falls and becomes susceptible to weakness and decay. Pain, sorrow, fear, and death were introduced, but these things are necessary in God's plan for our happiness. The apostle Paul said, “when I am weak then am I strong.”<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> Weakness and pain provide opportunities for us to grow and learn patience, humility, fortitude, and faith. And courage.</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis, the great Christian apologist, put it this way:</p>
<p>“This, indeed, is probably one of [God's] motives for creating a dangerous world--a world in which moral issues really come to the point. He sees … that courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions. Pilate was merciful till it became risky.”<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Even the end of our mortal experience, when our bodies finally yield to entropy and these beautiful, incredible biological entropy-fighting machines finally return back to the dust of disorder from which God's light and power made us, has its necessary purpose: to open the door out of this "vale of tears" back to our true home, for we don’t belong here! We are “wanderers in a strange land” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Alma 13:23</a> and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">26:36</a>), and as a wise man once said, we are “not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience.”<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> This world is not our home, and God does not mean for us to get too comfortable here.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Without extra effort on our parts, our spirits naturally sink into spiritual entropy: darkness, pride, and an absence of God’s light and influence. In order to avoid this, we must constantly work to fill our spirits with light. This process requires child-like humility and acceptance of God’s will and lots of hard work and dedication. The driving force and power behind this process is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It’s a lifelong process that is really without a destination – at least in this life. You never really get to a point where you can sit back and relax. If we are not actively filling our souls with light, then we are slipping back in to darkness.</p>
<p>The major difference between physical entropy and what I am here calling spiritual entropy is that in the physical world, entropy always wins in the end. Your phone, your computer, your car, your house, and yes, even your body, will all eventually lose the battle with entropy and decay, corrode, rust, rot, and disintegrate. However, Christ has already won the battle against spiritual entropy. The infinite power of the Atonement makes it possible for every one of God’s children to join His team and, through Him, win the battle for eternity. His light is there for us. All we have to do is everything we can do to let Christ into our lives. Our fear and unbelief are the only things in our way. May we all learn to trust in and rely on our Savior a little more, so we can share in His light. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>March 3, 2015<br />Robert J. Meek<br />President, Idaho Falls South Stake<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha, brothers and sisters! Thank you, Sister Meek, for that warm introduction! I’m blessed to have married above myself. My wife has been my steady companion and a positive influence in my life, and I love her. I feel that part of her warm heart comes from the experiences she had living in American Samoa as a young girl.</p>
<p>As my wife stated, I’m from Idaho. If I say, “<strong>Idaho</strong>” probably the first thing that comes to your mind is “<strong>Potatoes</strong>!” I've been involved with potatoes for most of my career and will use potatoes as an object lesson today.</p>
<p>Have you all eaten potatoes? Here is a photograph of some ordinary Idaho potatoes. I’d like to tell you a little bit about growing potatoes. In the spring, we purchase certified potato seed that is grown under unique conditions that keep them pure and without disease. This potato seed is hauled to our farms and cut into sections – each seed piece having an "eye," which has the ability to grow a sprout. The sections of potato are buried in the rich Idaho soil, and over the summer, a plant grows above the ground, while underground many tubers develop as storage vesicles for nutrients.<em> </em>When the potatoes have reached maturity and optimal size, tractors plow the fields, unearthing a bounteous crop of fresh potatoes. So, one humble, little potato has the potential to produce many more pounds of potatoes, and contribute to one of the largest crop productions in the world.</p>
<p>Now, what does potato production have to do with you? Just like the potato that comes from certified seed to be part of a global harvest, you are an ordinary individual that comes to earth with divine potential that can change the world. You are “certified” seed, meaning “<em>ye are gods; … children of the most High</em>” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/82.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Psalms 82:6</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.34?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">John 10:34</a>), the “<em>offspring of God</em>” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/17.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">Acts 17:29</a>), and “<em>heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ</em>” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/gal/4.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Galatians 4:7</a>). Thus, we see that He has created you with divine attributes, has placed you on earth for a great purpose, and has provided a Savior for you, which enables you to have the <strong>power to become</strong> like Him.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we learn of the <strong>power to become</strong>. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">John 1:12</a> says, “<em>As many as received him, to them gave he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">power to become</span> the sons of God, even to them that believeth on his name</em>.” This same<em> </em>scriptural truth is repeated in the D&amp;C and teaches that all who believe in Christ, receive Him through the waters of baptism, and live His gospel will have the power to become like God. It is through the Atonement of Jesus Christ that we are empowered. This magnificent gift of our Savior provides both the cleansing power to be forgiven of our sins and the enabling power to overcome our weaknesses.</p>
<p>I pray that we will all have the Spirit with us today. I invite you to be sensitive to the impressions from the Holy Ghost, that you will be inspired to act in a way that will bless you personally. I know that Heavenly Father loves you and has sent you to earth at this time for a great purpose.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson recently spoke at BYU–Idaho. I feel that what he said could be applied to you here at BYU-Hawaii. “You faithful students … can accomplish the impossible. You literally can help shape the destiny of the entire human family! You will be scattered like seeds in the wind to build up the Church in all parts of the world. As you know and apply the teachings of the Lord in your lives and in your work, you can change the world.” ("<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2015_01_26_Nelson.htm" target="_blank">The Lord Uses the Unlikely to Accomplish the Impossible</a>," BYU-Idaho Devotional, 26 Jan. 2015.)</p>
<p>Do you realize your worth and how the Lord is relying on you? It is important to understand who you are, so that you can apply the teachings of the Lord in your life and fulfill your purpose on earth.</p>
<p>I’d like to share an experience that reminded me that I was a son of God, that He loved me and has a work for me to do. I had been in South America sourcing new potato varieties and, at the conclusion of my trip, was scheduled to fly home from Lima, Peru at midnight on Saturday night. That weekend happened to be General Conference, so I went to a local Stake Center to view the proceedings on Saturday.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I asked a native Peruvian how long it would take to get from the Stake Center to the airport so that I could arrive in time to catch my flight. He said I should leave halfway through the Priesthood session, but then he cautioned me not to take a taxi. He said there were many taxis that were dishonest and very dangerous, and as a foreigner, I could be taken advantage of – even robbed and beaten. I thanked him for the information but knew that since I didn’t have a vehicle, or know anyone with a vehicle, my only option, other than walking, was to take a taxi.</p>
<p>That evening as the brethren stood to sing the rest hymn, I said goodbye to the missionaries in the RS room where we had been watching the session. One of the Zone Leaders, who looked like a big defensive lineman, offered to walk out to the street with me, and said he would try to find a good taxi. We stood there for a few minutes, and many taxis drove past, but none of them looked trustworthy.</p>
<p>Suddenly a Peruvian man wearing a white shirt and tie appeared at my side. He stated, “You are going to the airport,” and as I nodded, he said, “Wait a few minutes and I’ll be back.” Relieved, I thought he was going to get his car. However, to my surprise, he returned on foot, and then after watching the traffic for a few minutes, he stopped a taxi for us to get in.</p>
<p>Full of questions, I asked, “Who are you, and how did you know that I needed to go to the airport?” He replied that he was President Fernando Soriano, first counselor in the Stake Presidency. He then asked if I remembered the counsel from President Monson at General Conference a few years ago, that we were to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">act</span> when we receive impressions of the Spirit. Then, he said that tonight as he was singing the intermediate hymn, an unmistakable impression came into his mind: “Walk out to the street and you will find a man that you are to take to the airport.”</p>
<p>Following the promptings of the Spirit, President Soriano walked out to the street and found me looking for a taxi. He ran home to tell his wife that he would be going to the airport and would be home late. Because he didn’t own a car, he relied on taxis when he needed to get across the city and knew which ones were legal. Even so, our taxi did not have authority to enter the airport and stopped several blocks away, leaving us to walk the rest of the way. President Soriano helped me with my luggage and led me in the dark as we walked through an area where homeless men gathered around campfires.</p>
<p>Once we entered the airport, I thanked him for his assistance. Without his guidance, I knew that arriving at the airport safely without being robbed or beaten was questionable. However, President Soriano refused to say goodbye. He explained that in his impression, he had a very clear vision of escorting me through the security gate, and that until he had fulfilled his duty to God, he would not leave. I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this good brother who listened to the Spirit and came to my rescue at great personal sacrifice. I asked for a photo together, although I knew that I would never forget him. <em></em></p>
<p>As my plane flew through the night, I found I was sleepless. Tears flowed from my eyes as I reflected on the events of the evening. I have traveled throughout the world without any difficulty, yet, that night I was in danger. Even though I hadn’t been aware of my need, my Heavenly Father was. He knew of the potential perils that awaited and protected me by inspiring President Soriano to escort me to the airport. Although I have had spiritual experiences in helping others, I don’t know if I had ever been on the receiving end before as strongly as was manifested in this experience. I was humbled and overwhelmed with a feeling of exquisite love from above. I knew that God was aware of me individually as His son and that He loved me.</p>
<p>There is great power in recognizing that we are sons and daughters of God. Knowing that we have inherited divine attributes can bless us in our life’s sojourn on the earth. We can use the experience of the great prophet Moses in the Old Testament to see how the knowledge of our divine potential can change us and empower us. As we remember the story of Moses, shortly after he was born in Egypt, there was a decree for all Israelite boys under two years of age to be killed. However, God had a work for Moses and inspired his mother to create a little basket and hide him in the bulrushes by the river. The daughter of the Pharaoh found him and took him as her own and raised him with the other children of the King. It wasn't until later in his life that Moses learned who he was and God’s plan for him.</p>
<p>Going to the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, we can read the verses where Moses learned of his purpose on earth. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Moses 1:4</a>, Heavenly Father teaches Moses that he is His son: “<em>And behold, thou are my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of my hands</em>.” In<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank"> verse 6</a>, Heavenly Father tells Moses of his responsibilities: “<em>And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth</em>.”</p>
<p>Not long afterwards this incredible spiritual experience, Satan appeared. Now in the scriptural account, Satan wasn’t as subtle and devious as he is today. He simply came and tempted Moses to worship him. However, because Moses understood <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who</span> he was, that he was God’s son, he was able to withstand Satan’s temptations.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.12-13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">verse 12-13</a>, we read, <em>“Behold, Satan came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me. And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said:&nbsp; Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his only Begotten; and where is thy glory that I should worship thee?” </em>And in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">verse 16</a>,<em> “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not: for God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.”</em><em></em></p>
<p>In the very moment when Satan was tempting Moses to succumb, knowing that he was a beloved son of God gave Moses the strength to resist temptation and the power to overcome evil. Calling upon the Savior Jesus Christ, Moses commanded Satan to depart. Likewise, when we are facing adversity, we too can draw upon the incredible power of Jesus Christ to sustain us and lift us from the influence of Satan.</p>
<p>Continuing the account of Moses in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.24-26?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">verses 24-26</a>, it says, <em>“And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son; And calling upon the name of God, he beheld his glory again, for it was upon him, and he heard a voice, saying; Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters: for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God. And lo<strong>, I am with thee</strong>, even unto the end of thy days.” </em><em></em></p>
<p>Isn’t that powerful? So, what can we learn from this scripture? First of all, through the Holy Ghost, we can know all things, especially the reality of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. Secondly, God is with us, even to the end of our days and that He loves us. Moses learned through this experience that he was a son of God, and that knowledge strengthened him and empowered him to fulfill his role on earth. From my experience in Lima, Peru, I can also testify that God loves us and that He is with us.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, each of us will face difficulties and challenges while we are on the earth. It is part of Heavenly Father’s great Plan. However, likening Moses’ experience to our own lives, if we remember that we are sons and daughters of God and turn to Christ, we can successfully overcome all trials and temptations – and ultimately become exalted sons and daughters of God.</p>
<p>I appreciate President Tad R. Callister, Sunday School general president, and want to quote from his talk at BYU Education Week in August 2012 on “Our Identify and Our Destiny.” He said, <em>“</em>I&nbsp;would like to discuss with you a vision of who we are and what we may become.</p>
<p>“At a recent training session for General Authorities, the question was asked: ‘How can we help those struggling with pornography?’</p>
<p>“Elder Russell M. Nelson stood and replied, ‘Teach them their identity and their purpose.’</p>
<p>Brother Callister continued, “That answer resonated with me, not only as a response to that specific question but as an appropriate response to most of the challenges we face in life.” (“<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=2060" target="_blank">Our Identity and Our Destiny</a>,” BYU Education Week Devotional, 14 Aug. 2012.)</p>
<p>Does that impact you the same way it did me? Do you understand the significance of that counsel? According to Elder Nelson, if we understand our identity and purpose in life, we can successfully handle any challenge in life. How is that so? Let’s go back to Moses’ experience. What was the first thing God taught him? That he was a beloved son, in the similitude of His Only Begotten, the Savior. When Satan came to tempt Moses, how did he try to deceive him? By trying to confuse him and make him forget his divine heritage from God. I feel that Satan uses the same tactics today in even more subtle ways. He tries to confuse us, discourage us, and make us forget our worth. However, as members of the church, we know the truth; we know that we are sons and daughters of God, and that can set us free from Satan’s trap (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">John 8:32</a>).</p>
<p>I recently became a Stake President and received some counsel from an Area Authority. He said that as leaders, we don’t need to tell the members of our stake what to do. I remember thinking, “Okay, if we aren’t telling them what to do, then what is our job?” He wisely shared that our responsibility is to teach the members of our stake <strong>who they are</strong>, and then, they will know what they need to do. As I have served, I have seen the wisdom of that counsel.</p>
<p>No matter what challenges individuals might be facing or what temptations they need to overcome, by knowing they are beloved children of a Heavenly Father who wants to help them succeed and return to Him, they can be successful. As part of His glorious plan, God provided a Savior, who, because of His great love, paid the price for us. Drawing upon the power of the Atonement, we have access to strength beyond our own. We can be empowered to resist temptations, improve ourselves, love our neighbors, forgive others who have wronged us, fulfill our callings, magnify our stewardship – whatever we need to do in this life! The key for us, as sons and daughters of God, is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">utilize the Atonement every day and in every aspect of our lives</span>.</p>
<p>One of the marvelous opportunities I have, as Stake President, is to work with young members of our stake, about your age, in setting apart and releasing missionaries. How many of you have served missions? You know first-hand what I will talk about next, and for the rest of you, I want to paint the picture.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of eighteen months or two glorious years serving as a representative of Jesus Christ, the time has come to return home. After a joyous and emotional reunion with family at the airport, missionaries come straight to my office. I have the privilege of being the first one at home to hear what it has meant to represent the Savior and be an instrument in His hands.</p>
<p>After thanking them for their honorable service, I ask the missionaries to remove their name tag. Do you returned missionaries remember that request? There is usually a moment’s pause before doing so, one that is filled with emotion as memories of wearing the name tag flood over the missionaries. I remind them of Elder Neil L. Anderson’s words, that although they are no longer wearing the black name tag, it is engraven on their heart by the Spirit of the Lord. He has encouraged all returned missionaries to put their name tag in a place where they can see it, for the Lord needs them now, more than ever before, to continue to hasten the work.</p>
<p>After meeting with these great missionaries, they are rejoined by their happy family. I then invite the missionary to share their testimony with their family members. Each missionary testifies of the divinity of the Savior, and I’d like to share the thoughts of one recently returned missionary. He said, “Before my mission I was just a kid, and did some silly things. But for the past two years, I have taught the gospel of Jesus Christ, and in so doing; I have come to know the Savior. I know of His infinite goodness and love for each of us. I know that through the Atonement, we can be cleansed and forgiven. Through the Atonement, we can become pure and whole. Through the Atonement, we can become like Him.”</p>
<p>I am sure that each of you returned missionaries have shared similar testimonies, and to echo Elder Anderson, I encourage you to continue to testify of the Savior and His gospel and strive to become more like Him every day. On your mission, you learned how relying on Jesus Christ can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy and peace as we apply gospel principals. You came to understand that it is only through the power of the Atonement that we can become the sons and daughters of God whom our Heavenly Father needs and desires us to be.</p>
<p>I want to share an experience where I personally grew in understanding of the scripture I shared at the beginning – <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">John 1:12</a> – “<em>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</em>”<em> </em>In order to fulfill our purpose on earth and meet the challenges of life by rising to the highest in us, we will need to draw upon the powers of heaven to strengthen us, lift us, and sanctify us. In the experience I will share, I hope you can see how my dad utilized the Atonement to become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> than his naturally wonderful self could be.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2010, my parents were traveling from Colorado to Idaho to spend Thanksgiving with my family. While driving, they were involved in a serious accident when a 17-year-old drove across the median causing a head-on collision with my parent’s car. My mother was killed and my father badly injured. The 17-year-old and my father were airlifted to the nearest hospital where we gathered as a family to support each other.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe that our wonderful mother of eleven children and beloved wife was gone. It was the first time we had ever faced the loss of a loved one, and in deep sorrow, we turned to the Savior for understanding. I testify that in times of need, we can be blessed with the peace that “<em>passeth all understanding</em>” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Philippians 4:7</a>). Our mother had taught us the gospel and lived firmly in the faith that families could be together forever. We clung to that hope and her example.</p>
<p>As a family, we exercised faith in the power of priesthood blessings for our dad and witnessed many miracles. Each day after the accident, our father amazed the doctors by no longer having the life-threatening injuries that were apparent when he arrived at the hospital. On Sunday,&nbsp;a few of my brothers and sisters and I gathered in my dad’s hospital room, filled with thanks for the tender mercies we’d received in my dad’s recovery. When my father closed his eyes to rest, I left the room for a moment. As I walked down the hallway, I met a father and his teenage son dressed in white shirts and ties carrying some bread and water. Evidently, they were taking the sacrament to someone they knew in the hospital. I asked them if they would mind administering the sacrament to my father and family. They agreed, and we experienced what might be the most spiritual sacrament meeting I've ever attended.</p>
<p>After partaking of the sacrament, my father, in great pain because of broken ribs and other injuries, took the opportunity to bear testimony to us of the great Atonement. With tears of gratitude, he cried as he expressed his faith in the Savior and His atoning sacrifice in our behalf. Because of the Savior’s great gift, we would be able to return to our Father in Heaven’s presence and see our mother again. He encouraged us to live our lives with gratitude for the Savior and turn to Him so that we could be forgiven of our mistakes and overcome our weaknesses. At this poignant time of great sorrow and loss, my father recognized that the hope of being together again was only possible because of the Savior’s love. Experiencing the tender message of my father was a lesson I will never forget and one that I would witness my dad teach us again.</p>
<p>Later in the week, as my father was being released from the hospital, he made one final request. He asked if my brother and I would take him to the room of the 17-year-old boy that caused the accident. The young man was still in the intensive care unit with severe injuries. We wheeled my father into the room where the boy was lying with his parents at his bedside. My father greeted them and introduced himself. In my father’s next words, I witnessed the enabling power of the Atonement that elevates us to become true sons and daughters of God. With emotion, my father sincerely said, “I want you to know that I hold no hard feelings toward you. I don’t want you to blame yourself for what has happened. I hope that you can go on and live a good life.” My dad then testified of his faith in Christ and that because of the Savior, our spirits continue to live after death. My dad expressed his hope that one day he would see his wife again and shared his belief that our family would be together forever.</p>
<p>I was overcome with what I was hearing and, more importantly, what I was feeling. The feelings in the room were incredible. There was no hurt or bitterness. We all felt the redeeming love of the Savior as my father used the power of the Atonement to overcome the effects of a tragic accident. The unconditional love and forgiveness expressed by my father was only possible because he believed in the Savior. He had faith in glorious gift of the resurrection and knew that through the sealing power in temples, he would be reunited with his beloved wife and that we would be together again. Although this was an extremely difficult time, through the grace of God, my father was given power that enabled him to act as the Savior would, to be an example of the believers (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">1 Timothy 4:12</a>) and testify as a son of God.</p>
<p>What I experienced that day was the culmination of my dad’s sermon on the Atonement that he began on Sunday after partaking of the sacrament. I heard it with my ears, saw it with my eyes, and, most importantly, felt it burn deep within my heart. On that day, I had witnessed my earthly father use the power of the Atonement to become what his Heavenly Father knew that he could be. That experience changed me, and I know that by relying on Christ, we can all become more than we currently are.</p>
<p><em>“And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if you have experienced a mighty change of heart, and if you have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?”</em> (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Alma 5:26</a>). The questions posed by Alma in chapter 5 compose our Stake theme this year, and I encourage each of us to inquire of ourselves: Have we experienced that mighty change of heart? Have we been spiritually born of God? Have we felt that overwhelming love that our Heavenly Father has for us as His beloved sons and daughters? And my question is if so, what are we doing now?</p>
<p>Are we like the people of King Benjamin who said, “<em>Because of the spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually… And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God, to do his will</em>”<em> </em>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2-5?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Mosiah 5:2-5</a>). I feel that we can learn from these followers of Christ. It is not enough to hear and feel the word of God, but then, we must act to achieve our Heavenly Father’s plan for us on the earth.</p>
<p>I testify that we are literally the sons and daughters of God. Through my experience in Lima, Peru, I know that God loves us and will never leave us just as He promised Moses. And like Moses, I came to know that I was a son of God, and I have seen that He has a work for me to do. You, too, have a divine purpose – a work to do. Knowing that you are a beloved son or daughter of your Heavenly Father will help you persevere and overcome the trials of life. Because of my dad’s example after the accident, I have seen how we can apply the teachings of Jesus Christ in our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everyday</span> lives, no matter what we face, to become more than we naturally are – more forgiving, more capable, more Christ-like.</p>
<p>As believers in Christ, we have the promised “<strong>power to become</strong>” the sons and daughters of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">John 1:12</a>). I know that through applying the Atonement of Jesus Christ in our lives, we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> become who our Heavenly Father <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knows</span> we can be. I pray that we will each act on the promptings of the Spirit to do so.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>February 24, 2015<br />Fenton Broadhead<br />Vice President of Academics, BYU-Idaho<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>It is good to be with you this morning. It has been over 40 years since I was here on campus. I have traveled much, but in North and South America, Europe, and Africa, but not in this direction. I was here with a group of young men from Utah as part of a recognition trip for scouting. We traveled by boat from San Francisco. The majority of the group were sick from the ocean travel. We were on a type of troop transport. I wasn’t seasick during that part of the trip. However, when we arrived on the island and travelled by bus to campus, I became sick. The island seemed to be moving. I remember having my head out the window of the bus as we travelled from Honolulu.</p>
<p>Another major memory was my first experience surfing. I was a farm boy from central Utah. Most of our group were not into trying. I remember that the size of those old boards seemed huge. It felt like a boat. I do remember getting up a couple of times. There wasn’t any skill by way of turning; I was trying to stay up. I moved too far forward, and the front end of the board headed down. I fell off and could feel the board coming forward through the air and water, and I wondered if I was going to be pounded on the head. You can probably visualize my experience. I survived, my adventure was good, but that was the end of my surfing career. I am glad to be with you today.</p>
<p>It is the middle of the semester, the second semester of the year. How are you doing? Is it survival or opportunity? I hope you are enjoying your learning opportunity. It is always a challenge to see the opportunity versus the burden.</p>
<p>You may remember the following story shared from General Conference a few years ago. Elder Carl B. Cook was telling of a long day at the end of his first week as a general authority. His briefcase was overloaded, and his mind was occupied with the thought “How can I possibly do this?” He entered the elevator as he was leaving the Church Office Building. As the elevator descended, his head was down, and he was staring at the floor. The door opened and someone entered, but he didn’t look up. I quote the words of Elder Cook:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“As the elevator door closed, I heard someone ask, ‘What are you looking at down there?’ I recognized that voice – it was President Thomas S. Monson. I quickly looked up and responded, “Oh nothing.” But he had seen my subdued countenance and my heavy briefcase. He smiled and lovingly suggested, while pointing heavenward, ‘It is better to look up!’ As we traveled down one more level, he cheerfully explained that he was on his way to the temple. When he bid me farewell, his parting glance spoke again to my heart, ‘Now remember, it is better to look up.’”<span style="font-size: 8.3333330154419px;"><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p>At times in our educational experience, we need that reminder. We go from class to class, book to book, and semester to semester. At times, we look beyond the mark of learning – it is an interesting challenge. We may even carry a down-trodden appearance. It may have the feeling of survival.</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants section 88, the Lord gives direction concerning the hastening of the work; instruction and direction on learning and teaching about our opportunities. This was a season of revelation, of revealing how we prepare. In verse 118, we are instructed to seek learning:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>You are part of that instruction to seek learning. We are to seek from the best books and from the scriptures. We are to do so with diligence. We are to share with each other. Diligently means with focus on effort. In his book <em>The Power Within Us</em>, Elder Nelson referred to the power to learn. The power to learn is foundational to our presence here upon the earth. The power to learn is a special blessing to all. The power is within us to seek and obtain learning at levels we never thought possible.</p>
<p>One of the greatest blessings of my life has been an interest and desire to learn of those things that are before us on this earth. I have come to love the study of nature, the miracle of the body, the blessing of music, the understanding of plants and animals, the teaching of the scriptures, and the history of this and other lands. This learning opportunity from many areas has helped me to come to understand that learning is part of the gospel. Elder Neal A. Maxwell shared a thought that helps us better understand our learning opportunity and responsibility:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“For a disciple of Jesus Christ, academic scholarship is a form of worship. It is actually another dimension of consecration. Hence, one who seeks to be a disciple-scholar will take scholarship and discipleship seriously; and likewise gospel covenants. For the disciple-scholar, the first and second great commandments frame and prioritize life. How else could one worship God with all one’s heart, might, mind, and strength?”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Our effort to gain learning and understanding is part of our eternal progression. We are all presented with opportunities to gain in learning.</p>
<p>How did the Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and others of limited amounts of education increase in knowledge and learning? The majority of these were commonplace men who established a pattern of learning that blessed their lives.</p>
<p>Learning how to learn and a love of learning are paramount to our earthly and eternal happiness. My current stake president tells of his experience coming out of high school. He grew up in the Salt Lake Valley and Southeastern Idaho. He tells of his friend and him taking the ACT. His friend received his score, back and it was relatively low. Our stake president laughed at him, only to find as he opened his results that his score was even lower. He was not accepted at the university he desired. He told of starting at another university and then leaving on a mission. He told of how he learned how to learn, of how he felt the help of the Lord, with the power of the Holy Ghost, in the learning process. He returned from his mission and attended a good university where he was successful in his studies. Today, he is a very successful professional with a degree in civil engineering. Our Father in Heaven provides all of His children the opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>My first thoughts have shared reference to the importance of looking up and seeking learning. I want to share with you some basic principles that are to be applied if we are to obtain our fullest in learning and understanding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vision</strong></span></p>
<p>The first is vision. The perception of where we are going and why has an impact upon the goals and outcomes we desire. Here are questions you may ask yourself:</p>
<p>Why do I persist in learning? Why do I need an education? How am I going to accomplish this? Will I ever be finished with learning? How do we create that vision for learning? This love for learning?</p>
<p>How do we create that vision for learning? We can share facts about the value of education. Certainly a degree will pay off. Certainly the benefits of learning and education will pay off financially, but more than that, it will pay off spiritually and with the quality of life. How do we create a vision and expectation for learning? We must search, ponder, and pray.</p>
<p>Elder Godoy in October General Conference made a very important reference to an experience that he had concerning the gospel and learning. He tells of a time frame at the end of the eighties that was very important for him, his wife, and their four children. He was living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, working for a good company. He had finished his degree and had just been released from serving as bishop. He felt that life was good and everything that it needed to be. One day, an old friend came to visit. Let me quote the words of Elder Godoy:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“At the conclusion of his visit, he made a comment and asked a question that unsettled my convictions. He said, ‘Carlos, everything seems to be going well for you, your family, your career, and your service in the Church, but—‘ and then came the question, ‘if you continue to live as you are living, will the blessings promised in your patriarchal blessing be fulfilled?’</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I had never thought about my patriarchal blessing in this way. I read it from time to time but never with the intent of looking toward the blessings promised in the future and evaluating how I was living in the present.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“After his visit, I turned my attention to my patriarchal blessing, wondering, ‘If we continue to live as we are living, will the promised blessings be fulfilled?’ After some pondering, I had the feeling that some changes were necessary, particularly in relation to my education and profession.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>He then told of how he would have to seek additional education. He would have to leave his job, sell everything he had, and come to the United States. The TOEFL and GMAT tests became his major goals. Three years of preparation were required. He came to understand that as a child of God, he could succeed in learning and acquiring more education. He was successful and completed his education and returned to his native land. Elder Godoy was blessed by an increased perception of the importance of learning. He developed a vision for his efforts in gaining learning and education.</p>
<p>When I was a student at BYU–Provo a number of years ago, we had an experience that was part of an education class. We were to go on a three-day camping trip west of the Utah Valley area, which is basically desert. The first day, we arrived at our destination. The second day, it started to snow – heavy snow. A decision was made that we would pack up and leave versus staying the second night and into the third day. I realize that to some of you, snow is very foreign.</p>
<p>We started back out, and this was in the days before there were a lot of four-wheel drive trucks or cell phones. We ran into difficulty in the deep snow. We became confused at a fork in the road and took a wrong road. Eventually, we were stuck in the snow. A few of us hiked out to the main highway and caught a ride to the nearest community. This was a small Utah community named Eureka. About the only thing that was open at that time of night was the local bar/café. They connected us with some help, so we could help the others come out. As the people who were going to help us were establishing our location, I described the area, turn-off, etc. They finally said that this was the “No Name Road,” and that it wasn’t usually scraped to clear the snow until spring.</p>
<p>I have thought about the name of that road many times in my life – “No Name Road.” Sometimes, we can be on this road not knowing where we are going or what path we are on. A vision of where you would like to go and expectations of what you need to do is paramount. A vision of the blessing and opportunity of learning is special. Searching, pondering, praying, studying, and seeking inspiration will help create your vision for learning. It is important that we establish the road and path to follow.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gratitude</strong></span></p>
<p>The second point that I mention is gratitude. Elder John H. Groberg mentioned in his writings that gratitude is the key to growth. I want to share some reminders for different blessings that impact our opportunities for learning. The Lord has not left us alone as we journey through this life in search of learning, wisdom, and understanding.</p>
<p>You have a great blessing of coming to this university. You have faculty who know and care about you. You have faculty who go to great lengths to facilitate your learning and to stimulate your interest. They expect something from you and provide a way for you to learn how to accomplish the task. You have a wonderful place – a special site for you to receive an education. You have great faculty who will bless your lives. They provide ways to help you apply and understand. They mentor and coach. Let me reference a few teachers who were important in my life.</p>
<p>I think of my first university economics teacher. My background is in economics. His name was Robert Parsons. We held the class in a large room with probably 100 students or more. There was something about his excitement for the subject – his interaction with students. The class had an impact upon my decision to pursue a degree in economics.</p>
<p>I share another example of a sister I had as a freshman English teacher at BYU. Her name was Mrs. Watkins. As I started that class, my grades on papers were weak. She started to work with me. My grades improved and I received a good grade in the class. The most important element was that I developed the ability to write. I felt a growth of confidence and an understanding that with more work, I would develop even greater confidence. I came to know the value of a good teacher who mentored and coached me and other students.</p>
<p>I remember a faculty member in my master’s program. We developed a mentoring relationship that was very helpful. My interest in finance was increased because of his coaching and mentoring. I had another special experience in my doctorate program with a Dr. Armstrong at the University of Idaho. We worked and collaborated together in discussion on human capital, the brain, and learning. Not only was I mentored, but I developed a close friendship with him. I know that there are faculty who know you and want to help you be successful. And faculty, I know there are many students who look to you – they know you and will remember you forever. You are important in helping them rise to new levels. I think of the master teacher – the Savior, who lifted and blessed people’s lives. There are special bonds that grow between learners and teachers – bonds because of expectations, because of mentoring, and because of the action of the learner and the teacher.</p>
<p>Another area of major importance as we think of expressing gratitude is to our families – more particularly our parents who sacrifice and seek ways of helping us gain an education. There are family members and parents who pray for you each morning and night that you will be successful as a student. They pray that the Holy Ghost will help you in your studies. You come from a wide variety of backgrounds. From the mainland, from the islands, from parts of Asia. Your families work to sustain your opportunities. Some of them have prayed that you will have more of an opportunity and success than they did. I was blessed with parents who cared about my education, even though they had less than they desired by way of formal education. I share just briefly the background of my mother and her blessing upon her family by her example to acquire learning.</p>
<p>She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. She lived there for the first several years of her life. During her seventh year, in a four-month period of time, she lost her baby brother, her mother, and an older brother who was lost at sea in World War 1. It became very difficult for her father to care for all of the children. She lived with aunts and other family members for a while. An aunt had joined the Church and migrated to Utah. She had married, and this aunt and her husband sent a letter to my mother’s father asking him to send one of the children, and they would raise the child. My mother was chosen. She thought she was going on a holiday. She didn’t understand that she would never see her father or siblings again in this life. She traveled by boat to Ellis Island and New York City and from there, by train to Utah.</p>
<p>She was raised in her new location in central Utah. She finished the eighth grade, but because of distance to school and other reasons, she never finished more of formal education. However, her life was an example of learning and education. You would often find her doing crossword puzzles, reading the newspaper, reading books, studying the scriptures, and watching quiz shows. Her writing and penmanship was beautiful. I would watch her prepare lessons for teaching in Relief Society or Sunday School. She would work at having depth and perception. She was an example of learning and teaching. She blessed our home and our lives by instilling within each of her five children a desire to know of the things spiritually and temporally.</p>
<p>Again, I remind you of the importance of gratitude for the blessings and prayers of your parents.</p>
<p>Next, I hope you have appreciation – a spirit of gratitude for the special mentoring and partnership of the Holy Ghost. I don’t know exactly how everything works through the Holy Ghost, but I know that it works. We are blessed in our learning both spiritually and temporally by the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Desiring, inviting, living worthy, recognizing, and recording the help of the Holy Ghost provides assistance in learning. If we follow these steps, we prepare a climate for learning. This is not to say that the Holy Ghost will bear witness to every question on your next chemistry test, but it is to say that by having the Holy Ghost with you, you will be better prepared, walking by faith and acting with an effort to learn. You will have promptings on how to improve your learning.</p>
<p>As I reference the Holy Ghost as a blessing for which we need to show gratitude, I am reminded of a conversation with a potential hire to our faculty. I was visiting about his preparation to teach. We were discussing some of the challenges in engaging students in the classroom. He teaches at a university in the eastern part of the United States. You could see that he works very hard in being a good teacher and excellent facilitator of learning. In our discussion, he shared that each day before he started teaching, he closed his office door, kneeled, and asked for our Father in Heaven’s help in having the companionship of the Holy Ghost in his teaching. The companionship of the Holy Ghost is a blessing for students and teachers, and when both merit and seek that help, a special climate of learning will bless the experience.</p>
<p>Gratitude for the many blessings that help us achieve learning is most important. Gratitude for this university, for your parents, and for the Holy Ghost is important in growing in learning.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Work</strong></span></p>
<p>I have mentioned vision and gratitude. I now encourage you to understand the importance of action on your part. You have an opportunity to work hard and to work smart. Let me share a scripture given to the saints while in Jackson County, Missouri. They were waiting to learn the will of the Lord. In an often referred to scripture, we are taught that there is power within us. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27,28?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">D&amp;C 58:27-28</a> states, “Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>We have to establish patterns of action that help us use the power and potential. We are agents unto ourselves. When our Father in Heaven implies that we are agents, I am assuming that He wants us to figure out ways and patterns that will help us learn. I have been impressed by two quotes from <em>Preach My Gospel</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own.”<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The understanding of our own individual role in the learning process is important. If we want to be successful in temporal and spiritual learning, we have to develop good patterns for learning. Those patterns will indicate preparation, engagement, and reflection. There is a level of investment that is required.</p>
<p>We need to develop patterns of investment that will produce results. The results will move us from recall and understanding to application and deep learning. We study the gospel so we can apply the principles in our lives. We study accounting so we can apply the concepts and processes in our work. Think of what you do in preparation. I mentioned the Holy Ghost earlier, and certainly we pray. We read, mark, and try to solve problems. We review and discuss. I encourage you to ponder on the patterns you use. Become a student of how you can improve your learning. Work hard at your learning opportunity. Work hard and with perception of how you can improve your learning experience. I share a quote taken from a recent Priesthood and Relief Society lesson from President Ezra Taft Benson:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I grew up believing that the willingness and ability to work is the basic ingredient of successful farming. Hard, intelligent work is the key. Use it, and your chances for success are good.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>He emphasized hard and intelligent work. We must work hard and work smart.</p>
<p>I share with you a pattern that my wife used as we were called to serve in Brazil. She had no experience with Portuguese, other than the use of a few words or phrases. She thought she had accomplished something when she could go to McDonalds and order numero 1/number 1 by holding up one finger. She developed a few patterns of investment. She would read the Book of Mormon in Portuguese. From daily contact and conversation, she would write down new words or vocabulary. When she was going to give a talk in a meeting, rather than use an interpreter, she would write the talk in English, have someone translate the words into Portuguese, and then she would put the phonetics or the sounds above the words. She would then read the talk through her sounds and phonetics. She now understands the language very well and does a good job of speaking. The pattern and work blessed her.</p>
<p>Be wise and develop good patterns and strong efforts as you seek learning. Don’t follow old patterns that lead to shallow or recall type learning. This applies to temporal and spiritual learning. Do not let your efforts be shallow. Work to develop patterns that help increase learning.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recognize and Record</strong></span></p>
<p>The next point I share with you is the importance of recognizing and recording your learning experience. Ponder upon promptings. Record your learning experiences temporally and spiritually. Learn how to learn is a phrase that we often hear in the Church and in education.</p>
<p>It is a process that requires action and pondering. I admonish you to keep a journal of your learning experiences. Record when the light comes on in a physics class. Record what you observe from your teacher. Record what you struggle with and identify how you learn. I have always appreciated Elder Scott’s direction on recording promptings and personal revelation. He reminds us that as we do, we build. If we are going to learn how to learn, we will need to record and analyze the events that are taking place in the process.</p>
<p>And to the faculty, I would encourage you to record the experiences of your teaching. Record the names and thoughts of student; record what you observe in the learning process. Each day, take time to record the learning experiences of the day. You will be blessed, and your students will be blessed. The Lord will build upon your ability to learn and to teach. You will grow as a mentor, facilitator, and coach.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Build Others</strong></span></p>
<p>As I came onto your campus on Sunday, I saw the familiar words “Enter to Learn, Go Forth to Serve.” The last principle I would share with you is that with all of this special blessing of learning, you have the opportunity to find out what the expectations are. The expectations are that you will go forward and serve others. You will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">build others</span>. You can do that now. Work to bless and help others learn. Learn from and with each other. There is a great experience that comes with teaching one another. You will take the blessing of this wonderful school and go throughout the world. I love the first line of the heading of Matthew 10:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Jesus instructs and empowers the Twelve Apostles and sends them forth to preach, minister, and heal the sick.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>You are being taught and empowered to go throughout the world and build others – in your homes, wards, and communities.</p>
<p>Many years ago when I received my call to serve a mission, I had an interesting experience. I knew that I needed to serve a mission, but I couldn’t get a type of confirmation. I was still wondering why. It was in the fall months, with about a month before I left on my mission. I was out hiking in the mountains in central Utah. My friends were back in college or on missions. I decided to kneel down and pray about my concerns. I think that I thought that I would have a Joseph Smith experience. I didn’t. In fact, it was about six months later when I was in Brazil that I received an answer. We were teaching a second discussion – it was on the Book of Mormon. My turn came to share my testimony. As I bore my testimony, another feeling or prompting came to me. It was the answer to the prayer. You are here to share with these people the same blessings that you have had in your life. That blessing is the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>To all of you, you are children of the covenant with promises and direction. I share Elder Russell M. Nelson’s teaching concerning our covenants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We are also children of the covenant. We have received, as did they of old, the holy priesthood and the everlasting gospel. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are our ancestors. We are of Israel. We have the right to receive the gospel, blessings of the priesthood, and eternal life. Nations of the earth will be blessed by our efforts and by the labors of our posterity. The literal seed of Abraham and those who are gathered into his family by adoption receive these promised blessings – predicated upon acceptance of the Lord and obedience to His commandments.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>We have a major responsibility as children of the covenant to seek learning and understanding in order to fulfill our responsibilities.</p>
<p>You have been blessed. You can bless and serve others now, at this university and as you graduate and go forward. You have been empowered to learn with and from one another, empowered to take your education and go forth and bless others. There is a reason for this school and that is to prepare you to better serve our Father in Heaven’s children. The better prepared you are, the easier it is for the Lord to use you. Being prepared temporally and spiritually is the Lord’s desire for us.</p>
<p>I pray that you will take advantage of your time here – learn from the faculty and leaders, create an ongoing vision, express gratitude for those special blessings, act upon your opportunities, work hard, record your efforts on learning, and learn how to learn and serve and build others. You are His covenant children. I leave you my witness that our Father in Heaven knows you, cares about you, and loves you. The blessing of the gospel brings growth and happiness into our lives. And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>February 17, 2015<br />Jeff Flake<br />United States Senator (Arizona)<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha, brothers and sisters. And thank you, Cheryl.</p>
<p>You know, life is all about decisions. When I look back at all the decisions I’ve made over the years, maybe a few of them questionable, I think back to the decision to come to BYU–Hawaii in the Fall of 1983, the decision to throw my luggage in my dorm room and run to Temple Beach, the decision to strike up a conversation with a beautiful California girl there on the sand. These have to be the best decisions I have made in my life. More than 30 years later, I hope Cheryl feels the same.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn’t mention this, particularly in this setting, but seven years after we met, after being married and having three children, Cheryl and I returned to Laie and went immediately to that wonderful spot on Temple Beach, just to soak in the memories. We then drove up to the school. I said to Cheryl, “Wow, things have changed. That’s a new building there on the right, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“No, Honey,” she said. “That’s the library, and it was here when we went to school.”&nbsp; It was certainly new to me.</p>
<p>Our reunion tour took us to our favorite spots around campus. The Aloha Center, where we received our orientation. The cafeteria, where we received the freshman 15. The memories came flooding back. To the Laie Theater, the scene of our first date. We walked the same path where we walked back to campus so many years ago where on that first date, I stopped to pretend to tie my shoe as I picked up a small frog and slipped it into Cheryl’s hand. Not the best move on a first date, I learned.</p>
<p>Our reunion tour took us to the tennis courts where Cheryl informed me, after the first few dates, that it “just wasn’t working out.” To the Auditorium, where I remember sitting, without a date, as I watched Cheryl play the piano and sing before a cheering audience. It was then I realized I really needed to step up my game if I was ever going to pay for the frog episode and win her back. I’ve been trying to do so ever since.</p>
<p>The bits and pieces of class time I do remember here at BYU–Hawaii mostly involved a political science course taught by Dale Robertson. Dale might be here today, probably still wondering how I ever received a passing grade in his class. In fact, after I’ve had a tough week in Washington or on the campaign trail, I often blame Professor Robertson for starting me down the road to politics.</p>
<p>As I thought about a message I might be able to leave with you today, I reflected on the Apostle Paul’s admonition to Timothy, found in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">1 Timothy 4:12</a>: “Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean to “be thou an example of the believers”?</p>
<p>My guess is that most of you have grown up in an atmosphere and an environment where your adherence to faith has been tested on a regular basis, where you were required to stand up and stand out as an “example of the believers.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t always that way for me. I grew up in the small town of Snowflake in northern Arizona, a town that takes its name not from the weather but from my great-great grandfather William Jordan Flake, who settled the valley, and Erastus Snow, one of the Apostles chosen by Brigham Young to oversee the colonization of Arizona. I’ve sometimes thought that Laie is the Snowflake of the Pacific.</p>
<p>I was raised on a cattle ranch with six brothers and four sisters. The F-Bar Ranch also included the large families of three of my father’s brothers. In fact, I have 69 first cousins on my father’s side alone. That’s how I got elected. So when I hear that Congress’ popularity has been reduced to blood relatives, I can shrug and say, “Yeah, and I plan on ridin’ that popularity wave for a while.”</p>
<p>When I was not working on the ranch with my family and cousins, I was going to school with friends and relatives who shared my faith. It was, to put it mildly, a sheltered environment. &nbsp;When teaching Arizona geography, my government teacher in high school, Mr. Coltrin, used to refer to the structure on the large reservoir along the Colorado River not as Hoover Dam but as “Hoover Darn.” It was even written that way on all of our tests. Why swear if you don’t have to, he would remind us.</p>
<p>During my boyhood years, the only movie house in Snowflake was owned by the Church. One stake calling was to edit questionable scenes that might slip by the liberal reviewers of the PG ratings system. As you can imagine, some of the movies we watched were pretty short after that second review.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of how sheltered I was, I grew up not knowing that “flake” was a pejorative term. It was cool to be a Flake in Snowflake, or at least that’s what I led myself to believe, and later tried to convince Cheryl to believe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll never forget moving to Washington, DC to do an internship right after college. Cheryl and I were at a reception with members of Congress and their staff. We didn’t have nametags. I struck up a conversation with someone who asked where I came from. When I said Snowflake, he said “Hey, I know somebody from Snowflake,” but he struggled to recall the name. I rather innocently thought I’d narrow it down for him. “Was this guy a Flake?” I asked. He paused, thought for a minute, and said “No, no, he seemed pretty normal to me.”</p>
<p>It was then that I fully realized, “I’m not in Snowflake anymore.” I now find myself working in a city and in a profession where virtually ever action I take, nearly everything I write, and almost everything I say or post or blog is analyzed and scrutinized and cataloged for the next election. &nbsp;In a recent BYU forum, Mitt Romney likened such political scrutiny to the hymn that goes “Angels above us are silent notes taking.”&nbsp; That’s a kind way of putting it.</p>
<p>Soon after being elected to Congress in the year 2000, it was brought home to me the importance of “being an example of the believers.” I was debating an amendment I brought to the House floor that would have lifted our then 40-year-old ban on travel to Cuba. I’ll speak a bit more on this topic later, but during this debate, one of my Republican colleagues who disagreed with my position stood and said “The gentleman from Arizona just wants to lift the travel ban so he can drink mojitos on the beach in Cuba.” Now, I didn’t learn this in Snowflake, but I now know that a mojito was a rum-based drink.</p>
<p>Immediately, one of my Democratic colleagues, David Obey of Wisconsin, stood and demanded that the Republican’s words be “taken down” or removed from the record. In the House of Representatives, you are not allowed to say something that impugns the motives or reputation of another. What was unusual here was that a Democrat chose to stand and defend me, a Republican. In this partisan environment, that just doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>After the words were removed and the congressional record was corrected, I went over and asked Congressman Obey why he had defended me. “Ah, Flake,” he said, “I know you’re Mormon. I know you don’t drink. I was just defending your honor.”</p>
<p>We may not always realize it. Sometimes, we may wish it weren’t so, but we need to be aware that in all times and in all places, we are being looked to as an example of the believers.</p>
<p>In the United States Senate today, there are six members of the LDS faith. That’s a pretty good percentage given that we represent less than one percent of the country’s population. I was sworn in as a new senator in January of 2013. As you know, a term in the Senate is six years (which, by the way, is one of the founding fathers’ greatest achievements). I served 12 years, or six terms, in the House, and every other January, every member of the House of Representatives stands in unison, pledging to uphold and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Senate, only one-third of the body is sworn in every two years, which allows for a more personal swearing in ceremony. Four senators at a time are escorted to the well of the Senate chamber, where the Vice President of the United States, who also serves as President of the Senate, reads the oath of office and “swears you in.” We were invited to bring our own family bibles to hold in our left hand as our right arm is raised as this rite is performed.</p>
<p>I, of course, brought a leather-bound quad, with the Standard Works listed on the cover. I wondered what someone in the chamber or somebody watching C-SPAN might think if they saw it, but it passed without notice. I returned to my seat in the Senate chamber and as the next group of four newly-elected Senators passed toward the well, one stopped and said, “Senator Flake, I forgot my bible, can I borrow yours?” “Sure.” I said, wondering how long it would take before he looked down to realize that he was holding something a bit heavier than just the King James Version of the Bible.</p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief when he returned to my desk without incident, handing the book back, thanking me. I looked across the well of the Senate and saw the majority leader, Harry Reid, a member of our faith, wearing a big smile. He walked over and asked, “Brother Flake, when are you going to inform that good senator that he just swore his oath on the Book of Mormon?” I said, “I think I’ll see how he votes for awhile.”</p>
<p>When the Senate is in session, we have a weekly prayer breakfast, attended by roughly one-third of the body as schedules permit. Each week a different senator is asked to talk about his or her faith – to give a sort of devotional, minus the plate of brownies. The senator who speaks also chooses the hymn that is sung at the beginning of the meeting. Several months ago, it was my turn.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you, to join with nearly 30 of my Senate colleagues in singing “I Am a Child of God” is an experience I will never forget. A few weeks later, when another member of our Church was asked to speak and choose the hymn, we sang “Have I Done Any Good in the World Today?” Now, I know what you’re thinking – for a bunch of politicians in Washington, that’s not an easy question to truthfully answer.</p>
<p>I’ve come to realize that there are opportunities to be an example of the believers at every turn, if we will just look for them. When I fly back and forth from Arizona to Washington each week, it is usually on U.S. Airways, sometimes crammed in a middle seat – not too glamorous – but on rare occasions when the President happens to be flying to my state, I get to tag along on Air Force One. Nothing against U.S. Airways, but Air Force One has more leg room.</p>
<p>On one such occasion a number of years ago, President Bush invited me on board. Now, one of the best things about flying on Air Force One is that at each first class-style seat is a telephone. When you pick it up, you hear a voice belonging to an operator situated in the command center on the second floor of the 747, saying “Whom would you like to call?” Here’s the best part. You give the operator the number, and the call is made. When someone picks up on the other end, the operator says, “This is Air Force One, calling for…” I first called my parents, who were duly impressed. I then had the operator call my kids’ school, where the principal was more than happy to call them out of class on the loudspeaker to take a call from Air Force One. It’s all about scoring points with the kids.</p>
<p>I then fought the urge to call a few of the girls from high school who dumped me because they assumed my career prospects were limited at best. Fortunately I didn’t have their numbers.</p>
<p>Finally, on this particular trip, I thought I’d check on one of my home teaching families. The week before, I had stopped by the hospital to help give a priesthood blessing to Brother Sid Stephenson, who was now at home recuperating. The operator dialed the Stephenson home. Sid’s wife Jeanne answered and excitedly ran to put Sid on the phone.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that President Bush walked by and stopped to say hello. I cupped the receiver and said, “Mr. President, in our church we have a program called home teaching, and I have on the phone one of the families that I am assigned to look after. Sid is recuperating from a heart attack. Would you mind saying hello?”</p>
<p>“Sure!” the President said, taking the phone from my hand. “Sid, Dubya here. ’Lot a people on Air Force One are concerned about ya.” There was silence on the other end of the phone. I thought, “Shoot, Sid’s had another heart attack.” What have I done? Fortunately, after a momentary pause, Sid spoke up and had a memorable conversation with the President. I went home and marked off my home teaching for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, I have witnessed first hand what can happen when even a small number of courageous individuals are not afraid to stand up and be counted among the believers.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier my attempts to lift the travel ban that prohibits most Americans from traveling to the island of Cuba. Soon after its revolution in 1959, Cuba became formally communist and officially atheist. Until recently, one could not be a so-called “Believer” – that is the word that is used – one could not be a believer and remain a member of the communist party. In a one-party state where the government controls every sector of the economy, being an “example of the believers” might cost you your job and your livelihood.</p>
<p>In the period since the Pope’s visit to Cuba in 1998, religious space has widened a bit, but only a bit. A small branch of the LDS Church has operated in Havana for more than a decade without fulltime missionaries and with little exposure to members outside of the country. Under such circumstances, the growth of the Church in Cuba has been limited. Still, these faithful, believing members have persisted over the years, hoping and praying with absolute faith that there will be better days ahead.</p>
<p>Having toured with the BYU Young Ambassadors to the Middle East in the 1980s, Cheryl was aware of the doors such groups can open. The group’s director approached Cheryl and asked if we could help facilitate the Young Ambassadors traveling to Cuba after their tour of the southern United States in the spring of 2011. It so happened that our daughter Alexis was part of the group. After much work, many prayers, and many small miracles along the way, the Young Ambassadors took a flight from Miami to Cuba. Cheryl and I had the good fortune to accompany them.</p>
<p>The Young Ambassadors performed in several venues around Havana, including a packed auditorium with 1,600 people. In the audience were senior government officials. The visit culminated on a Sunday with a testimony meeting at the small LDS branch, where these stalwart Cuban believers were outnumbered by their visitors.</p>
<p>Again, senior government officials were in attendance. One of these government officials was seated next to Cheryl, kindly translating the Spanish testimonies into English for her. “How wonderful is it,” Cheryl told me later, “when you can hear a die-hard communist whisper ‘I know the Church is true’ in your ear during a sacrament meeting.” I think that’s the very definition of a tender mercy.</p>
<p>In 2012, just one year after the Young Ambassadors tour, Elder Bednar visited Cuba, and on a hill overlooking the harbor in Havana, near a large statue of Christ that pre-dates the Cuban revolution, he dedicated the land for the preaching of the Gospel. Last year in June, Elder Holland visited Cuba and organized a second branch of the Church. &nbsp;These developments have come about because a handful of dedicated members, in an officially atheist country, are not afraid to be counted among the believers.</p>
<p>You may have heard recently of changes to U.S. policy in Cuba. Two weeks before Christmas, I received a call from the White House on a Monday, asking if I could be at Andrews Air Force Base at 4:30 AM that Wednesday for a covert mission. Would I ever! This Senate stuff had been a bit boring lately. I wasn’t allowed to tell Cheryl or anyone where I was going. My staff assumed I was flying back to Arizona.</p>
<p>At Andrews Air Force Base, I was joined by Democratic Senator Pat Leahy and Congressman Van Hollen, and we boarded a plane. Our mission was to fly to Cuba and pick up an American contractor, Alan Gross, who had been held for five years in a Cuban prison. Another plane took off just after we left the tarmac, also bound for Cuba. Its mission was to pick up an American asset, a spy who had been held for 20 years in a Cuban prison. A third plane would soon depart from Miami, carrying three Cuban spies who had been held in a U.S. prison.</p>
<p>This complicated spy swap was highly choreographed. All three planes had to land and take off within minutes of each other at separate airfields near Havana. Our plane was on the ground for exactly 31 minutes before taking off with our cargo, the freed American, Alan Gross. We sped back to Washington. Minutes after we landed, President Obama made a public statement at the same time Raul Castro made a public statement in Cuba, announcing a path to normalized relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The following day I received a call from President Obama to talk about the way forward with Cuba. Two minutes later, my phone rang again with a more exciting call: it was Elder Holland, thrilled about new opportunities for religious freedom on the island.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, a senior LDS missionary couple arrived in Cuba to act as “branch builders,” the first LDS Church officials allowed by the Cuban Government to stay on the island for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that going forward, the powerful example a handful of believers in Cuba will lead to many, many more believers in Cuba.</p>
<p>There’s always been something about islands that draws me in. Maybe it’s having been raised on a dry dusty ranch and makes me want to be surrounded by water, but whatever it is, I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.</p>
<p>For decades, I’ve been fascinated with survival stories – especially sailing adventures gone bad. That seems to be my favorite genre. I’ve always wondered what would happen if I were marooned on an island. Could I survive? Six years ago, Cheryl got tired of hearing me talk about these things and said something like “If this is your mid-life crisis, go ahead and get it over with.”</p>
<p>So in 2009, I looked on Google Earth, found some suitably remote islands among the Marshall chain in the central Pacific, and went about planning to maroon myself. I decided I would just take a few essentials: a machete to open coconuts, a mask, fins, snorkel, a Hawaiian sling to spear fish, a magnifying glass to start a fire, a hammock, and a manual desalinator pump to make fresh water. That was about it. Now, I realize that for many of the Pacific Islanders here today, this doesn’t sound too exotic, but it does to a kid from Snowflake.</p>
<p>After flying from Arizona to Hawaii to Majuro to Kwajalein, I was dropped off on an uninhabited island called Jabonwod, consisting of 25 acres of sand, coral, and coconut trees. I experienced many sensations during my week there. Chief among these were fear – after more than a few close encounters with sharks; hunger – you can only eat so much fish and coconut; thirst – the coconut water craze is so over for me.</p>
<p>But most of all, it was the sensation of loneliness that about did me in. Nothing compares to being and feeling alone, completely alone. I had no volleyball to talk to, so I resorted to numbering hermit crabs that wandered through my camp with a sharpie pen that had been given to me on Kwajalein. By the end of the week, I’d numbered 126 crabs. I still miss #73.</p>
<p>I returned to the Marshall Islands two years ago with our two teenage boys, who are still at home, for a similar survival experience, and last year, I took a Democratic senator and a camera crew from the Discovery Channel to film what they called “Rival Survival.” We proved once and for all, as Steven Colbert described it, that “Republicans and Democrats can get along when death is the only option.”</p>
<p>There’s an old English poem that proclaims, “No man is an island.” If my lonely island adventures have taught me anything, it is that this concept is true. We need each other. We rely on each other. Life is worth living because of the interactions we have with one another, and our happiness depends on the lives we lead and the examples we set for each other.</p>
<p>Let me just say in closing what an honor it is to serve in the United States Senate. I am humbled each time I look up at the dome of the Capitol and reflect on the sacrifices that have been made to bring this great nation to where it is today. But I am even more blessed to be a husband, a father, and to be counted among the believers. I don’t know the answers to all questions, but I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that His gospel has been restored to the earth. This testimony, and the covenants that I have made to affirm these beliefs, is the true source of happiness in my life.</p>
<p>I love this university. I owe much of what I am and hope to be to the decision I made more than 30 years ago to come here and run straight to Temple Beach.</p>
<p>I am ever indebted to parents, siblings, friends, and church leaders who have and continue to heed the Apostle Paul’s admonition to be examples of the believers.</p>
<p>May we all do the same is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>February 10, 2015<br />Max L. Checketts<br />Vice President of Academics<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>This week, we celebrate the founding of Brigham Young University – Hawaii, formerly known as the Church College of Hawaii. Many have written about its founding and the direct involvement of President McKay and other church leaders, the sacrifice of local saints and the wonderful students such as yourselves who have entered to learn and then gone forth and served as we know you can and will do. It is a great story and one that I encourage all of us to continue to learn and share. Who from our choir are alums?</p>
<p>I love stories and what they can teach me and those I love and serve. Recently, while reviewing stories from the Bible, I discovered that hundreds of stories can be found in the Old Testament alone. In fact, one reference claims 1,739 Old Testament stories and 1,068 in the New Testament. We are also blessed to have stories from the Book of Mormon and modern scripture.</p>
<p>With my roots in agriculture, I have been interested in the parables about farming and animals in particular. The Savior as the master teacher used situations and settings that were familiar with his followers and those He taught that could allow them to be taught by the Holy Ghost if their desires were righteous.</p>
<p>Two of those parables that I would like to discuss involve sheep. I find now that many are familiar with the basic stories. Many have not experienced the feelings that the Savior wished for His followers to experience because animals are so removed and distant from many of us today. In the parable of the lost sheep, He wished to convey that He, the Savior, as the shepherd of our souls, would go to great lengths, even leaving the 99, to find the one. Watch this video and notice who he is speaking with and why:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/bible-videos/videos/jesus-declares-the-parable-of-the-lost-sheep?lang=eng" target="_blank">VIDEO – LOST SHEEP</a></p>
<p>Most of you have never seen a flock of sheep grazing on a rugged mountain side. There is a shepherd and usually some faithful sheep dogs watching over the flock and caring for their protection and growth. Today, these flocks are usually large, and each individual becomes a number, but in the Savior’s day, each ewe, ram, or lamb was an individual and probably had a name. The relationship of the shepherd was not only economical in that the sheep provided his means of living but the sheep were his companions in a lonely land, his friends.</p>
<p>Can you find the lost sheep in this picture? He really is a happy boy. We call him Beefy; I guess he takes after his father and grandfather. What would I do for this lost lamb, my grandson?</p>
<p>Now I know the story, but what does it mean? What is the worth of one sheep? One soul? Was their someone else in the video? Did he care for the sheep? Was he willing to go with great discomfort and effort to find the lost lamb or soul? Or in the picture, who was Beefy crying out to? His mother? His father?</p>
<p>To help you experience the feelings conveyed by this parable, I have asked Brother Ah Quin to sing hymn #221, Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd. This hymn written by Mary Wingate, not a member of our church but I believe inspired just the same.</p>
<p>Did you notice the invitation in verse three: “Will you not seek for my lost ones?” We answer in verse four with “yes.” As His disciples, we are ready to be His “under-shepherds’ to seek the lost sheep. You might feel that the invitation to lost sheep everywhere to come back would be a good way to end this hymn, but no. Instead, it is a call to the followers of Jesus to seek out those who are lost, for that is the message the Savior intended as He shared this parable. Remember, He is the Shepherd; we are the under-shepherds.</p>
<p>The King James Version of <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Luke 15:4</a> says, “What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine&nbsp;in&nbsp;the wilderness, and go after that which is&nbsp;lost, until he find it?”</p>
<p>Notice “if he lose” the sheep, as recorded in the scripture. In this hymn by Mary Wingate, she changes it to teach that these sheep have wandered, perhaps accidently or even knowingly. They have left the flock and wandered away.</p>
<p>David O. McKay, several years before the founding of BYU–Hawaii said, “That man is most truly great who is most Christ like. What you sincerely in your heart think of Christ will determine what you are, will largely determine what your acts will be” (Conference Report, Apr. 1951, 93).</p>
<p>That is a wonderful parable but is far more meaningful when you understand the next parable about Christ as the good Shepherd.</p>
<p>Let’s listen to the Lord’s words as He shares the next parable:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/bible-videos/videos/the-good-shepherd-and-other-sheep-i-have?lang=eng" target="_blank">VIDEO – THE GOOD SHEPHERD</a></p>
<p>As I teach others, I use positive uplifting messages to instruct, edify, and motivate others to learn and grow. I found this challenge that uses the opposite to invite us to look inward to ourselves. I felt guilty in a few situations. How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>You are the one who has turned a calling (Shepherd) into a career (Sheep herder).</strong></p>
<p>Down deep in your gut, you don’t really care as much about reaching lost people because it’s hard, long, tedious work, and you know that no matter how many times you deny it.</p>
<p>You are the one who tries to fit your ministry around your hobbies, pet causes, and other priorities.</p>
<p>You are hard to get a hold of and don’t respond to people quickly, and it’s all because you don’t really care that much.</p>
<p>You think that your people are really fortunate to have someone of your ability because you have been … trained, ordained, started as a volunteer, did something great many years ago, have been around for a long time, or replaced someone even more pathetic than you.</p>
<p>You are the one who, when a wolf shows up, lets him start eating sheep because the truth is you aren’t concerned about wolves feasting on sheep because that’s what you’ve been doing as their shepherd anyway.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t really preach hard truth, don’t warn your people about danger, and are more like a cowardly enabler than a courageous leader.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You pretty much always get your day off, your vacations and holidays, and far more when no one else is looking.</p>
<p>You don’t have a long list of sins of commission (e.g. adultery, thievery, murder) but rather a long list of sins of omission (e.g. not working hard, not doing your best, not loving the people), and this leaves the sheep confused about what to do with their lazy shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>You are really good at making excuses—way better than being a true under shepherd.</strong></p>
<p>We have heard President Kimball when he taught, “God does notice us, and watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs” ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng" target="_blank">Small Acts of Service</a>," <em>Ensign,&nbsp;</em>Dec. 1974, p. 5).</p>
<p>Elder J. Richard Clarke shared this story to help us understand how we as under shepherds serve the Savior by meeting another’s needs.</p>
<p>A dear sister had been incapacitated for the past eight years – she could not walk or talk and was confined to bed. About six years ago, she and her husband were assigned a faithful home teacher. He asked if his wife could come over to their house every Sunday morning and stay with the invalid woman while her husband attended priesthood meeting. For six years, every Sunday, this home teacher would bring his wife over to stay with the invalid sister while her husband went to his meeting, and every Sunday, the home teacher’s wife would bring with her some baked goods or something special that she had made for this older couple.</p>
<p>Finally, this sister who had been ill passed away. When her daughter tried to express her deep love and appreciation to this loving home teacher and his wife for what they had done over the years, the wife said, “Oh, don’t thank us. It was our privilege to visit with your sweet mother. What am I going to do now?&nbsp; The hour and a half on Sunday morning will now be, for me, the loneliest hour and a half in the week”&nbsp; ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1981/10/love-extends-beyond-convenience?lang=eng" target="_blank">Love Extends beyond Convenience</a>,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1981, p. 81)</p>
<p>What do true shepherds do for their sheep? In the book of Ezekiel you find these active words: Search, seek, deliver, gather, feed, bind up, and strengthen (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ezek/34.11,12,13,14,15,16?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">Ezekiel 34: 11-16</a>).</p>
<p>To be an under shepherd is an active discipleship, not passive.</p>
<p>This leads me to the final video clip that helps us understand the need for protection from thieves, robbers or wolves.</p>

<p>Who or what is the wolf?</p>
<p>As I have tried to be a good father and grandfather, I see adversity come into the lives of my children and grandchildren. I know it is for their growth, but sometimes the hurt is so challenging.</p>
<p>Let me use the sacred covenant of marriage to show how God’s love is key. We should think of the role of the shepherd and recognize possible wolves. Elder Hafen explains this very well. He started by telling this story.</p>
<p>Another bride sighed blissfully on her wedding day, “Mom, I’m at the end of all my troubles!” “Yes,” replied her mother, “but at which end?”</p>
<p>Elder Bruce Hafen has taught this so well using principles found in these parables.</p>
<p>“Marriage is by nature a covenant, not just a private contract one may cancel at will. Jesus taught about contractual attitudes when he described the “hireling,” who performs his conditional promise of care only when he receives something in return. When the hireling “seeth the wolf coming,” he “leaveth the sheep, and fleeth … because he … careth not for the sheep.” By contrast, the Savior said, “I am the good shepherd, … and I lay down my life for the sheep.”<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>Many people today marry as hirelings. And when the wolf comes, they flee. This idea is wrong. It curses the earth, turning parents’ hearts away from their children and from each other.”</p>
<p><em>Contract</em>&nbsp;companions each give 50 percent; <em>covenant</em>&nbsp;companions each give 100 percent.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Every marriage is tested repeatedly by three kinds of wolves.</p>
<p>The first wolf is<strong> natural adversity.</strong> After asking God for years to give them a first child, David and Fran had a baby with a serious heart defect. Following a three-week struggle, they buried their newborn son. Like Adam and Eve before them, they mourned together, brokenhearted, in faith before the Lord.<sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Second, the wolf of their<strong> own imperfections</strong> will test them. One woman told me through her tears how her husband’s constant criticism finally destroyed not only their marriage but her entire sense of self-worth. He first complained about her cooking and housecleaning and then about how she used her time, how she talked, looked, and reasoned. Eventually, she felt utterly inept and dysfunctional. My heart ached for her and for him.</p>
<p>Contrast her with a young woman who had little self-confidence when she first married. Then, her husband found so much to praise in her that she gradually began to believe she was a good person and that her opinions mattered. His belief in her rekindled her innate self-worth. (As an aside, this is the story of Johnny Lingo.)</p>
<p>The third wolf is the <strong>excessive individualism that has spawned today’s contractual attitudes</strong>. A seven-year old girl came home from school crying, “Mom, don’t I belong to you? Our teacher said today that nobody belongs&nbsp;to anybody—children don’t belong to parents, husbands don’t belong to wives. I am&nbsp;yours,&nbsp;aren’t I, Mom?” Her mother held her close and whispered, “Of course you’re mine—and I’m yours, too.” Surely marriage partners must respect one another’s individual identity, and family members are neither slaves nor inanimate objects. But this teacher’s fear, shared today by many, is that the bonds of kinship and marriage are not valuable ties that bind but are, instead, sheer bondage. Ours is the age of the (decline) of belonging.</p>
<p>He then closes with this statement: “May we restore the concept of marriage as a covenant, even the new and everlasting covenant of marriage?<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>And when the wolf comes, may we be as shepherds, not hirelings, willing to lay down our lives, a day at a time, for the sheep of our covenant.”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I pray that we might understand our Father’s love who sent His Son; that we might understand His Son, our Savior, who gave His life so that we might share in His hope and love; the Savior, Christ, who followed the plan of our Father and restored truth, authority, and purpose through Joseph Smith, the prophet, and all the prophets since; that we might understand the love, covenant love, that would give one’s life, one’s own hopes, for the fulfillment of your spouse or someone you care deeply for; love of a Shepherd who would knowingly give His life so that we can live.</p>
<p>Please listen to this final hymn that will be sung by the Hawaiian Choir, and I pray that the Spirit will convey to your heart the Savior’s love, of which I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media150203<br><title>God, Our Heavenly Father | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>February 3, 2015<br />Benjamin Jordan<br />Associate Professor of Biochemistry &amp; Physical Science<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha! Today, I hope to convey to you some sense of eternity and your place in it.</p>
<p>Most of you that are here today were raised in the LDS Church. Many of you are converts, and some of you have other religious beliefs outside of the LDS Faith. Regardless of your background, your culture, your race, your politics, your favorite hobby, or your grades, you are all children of God. As such, you have the potential to become like Him – with all that that entails. Our ultimate goal, even if we don’t always or rarely take time to think about it, should be to become like our Heavenly Parents.</p>
<p>During the great Intercessory Prayer, our Savior prayed, “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In that one sentence is a powerful lesson about the purpose and nature of our existence – or YOUR existence.</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Smith said, “It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>He also said, “There are but a very few beings in the world who understand rightly the character of God. The great majority of mankind do not comprehend anything, either that which is past, or that which is to come, as it respects their relationship to God. They do not know, neither do they understand the nature of that relationship. … If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves. … I want to ask this congregation, every man, woman and child, to answer the question in their own hearts, what kind of a being God is?”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Joseph then answered his own question:</p>
<p>“God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! That is the great secret. If the veil were rent today, and the great God who holds this world in its orbit, and who upholds all worlds and all things by His power, was to make himself visible,—I say, if you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form like yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man; for Adam was created in the very fashion, image and likeness of God, and received instruction from, and walked, talked and conversed with Him, as one man talks and communes with another.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1973, the Council of the Twelve Apostles issued a statement in which they said, “The Lord’s plan of salvation requires that you pass through trials in this mortal life. Those trials seem to be greatest when you reach fatherhood [and I would add motherhood], but be assured—fatherhood [and motherhood], in a sense, <em>is an apprenticeship to godhood</em>.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>So, in other words, what does it mean to be a Heavenly Parent – a God, with a capital “G?”&nbsp; Well, being a “God,” with a capital “G,” means being a “Father,” with a capital “F,” or a “Mother,” with a capital “M.”</p>
<p>As a boy, I remember my father having a large key ring with dozens of keys on it. All of the keys looked exactly alike to me. I was amazed at how my dad knew which key went to which door or cabinet. But even more amazing to me than how he knew which key went where was my dad’s seemingly amazing ability to find the right road when we travelled.</p>
<p>I grew up in a small, rural community in Utah. Occasionally, we would take family trips to Salt Lake City. We would enter the Salt Lake Valley from the east, exiting what is known as Parley’s Canyon. As we would leave the canyon and enter the valley, the highway seemed to split into countless off-ramps, on-ramps, side-roads, multi-lane freeways, and intersections surrounded by buildings of all shapes and sizes with thousands of other cars all around us, each coming and going on their own errands. There were no smart phones with built in navigation, no GPS, and he didn’t use any maps, yet my dad always, without hesitation, found his way to wherever we were going. I could not understand how he knew his way in such a complex situation, yet I had complete trust that my dad could get us to our destination. Now, as an adult, I do what he did and find my way on complex road systems – although today it is nice to have GPS.</p>
<p>Now, think on how that situation relates to our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>I want you to think for a moment of the clearest sky, on the darkest night, you have ever seen. Think about the stars you could see. How many were there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clearest night I have ever experienced was at Ras al Hadd, Oman on the easternmost tip of the Arabian Peninsula. I was there with my family to watch sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. For a time, as we waited for our guide, we stood beneath a sky full of stars. There was no moon. There were so many stars that the starlight literally illuminated the ground. It seemed to me that there must have been millions of stars. However, it turns out, that in reality, even on the darkest night in the darkest place, the greatest number of stars that can be seen from any point on Earth is less than 10,000.<a href="#6" style="font-size: 8.3333330154419px;"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;How do we know? Well, that’s what graduate students are for – to count stars so that their professors don’t have to.</p>
<p>All of the stars that we can see are part of the Milky Way galaxy, where our sun and its solar system reside. However, by using telescopes to see beyond our normal eyesight, astronomers estimate that, at a minimum, there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy. Some estimates indicate that there may be three to four times that number – up to 400 billion stars<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. If we are overawed at the 10,000 stars we can actually see, how much more in awe would we be if we could see 100 billion?</p>
<p>But the Milky Way is only one galaxy in a universe full of them. In 2003, a group of astronomers used NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope to look at what was considered one of the emptiest spots in the sky. In order to gather as much light as possible, the telescope was left open to collect light for four months. The image that resulted is now one of the most famous in astronomy. Named the “Hubble Ultra-Deep Field,” it is an image that contains over 10,000 <em>galaxies</em><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. This image consists of an area of the sky the size of a dime held up 75 feet or 25 meters away from the viewer.</p>
<p>Except for six stars, all of the features in the image are galaxies. This is what the <em>emptiest </em>parts of the universe look like!</p>
<p>It is currently estimated that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in the known universe. If we conservatively assume that they all have about 100 billion stars in each of them, then we can estimate that there are, at least, 10 HEXTILLION stars in the universe. That is a 1 with 22 zeros behind it. That is, literally, more stars than sand grains on all the beaches and in all of the dunes in all of the deserts on Earth.</p>
<p>So when the Lord says, “And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten,”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;He is not exaggerating.</p>
<p>But it isn’t just space that is expansive. Light travels, and it moves very quickly. It moves at 300 million meters per second. To give you a concept of what that means, it took the Apollo astronauts, moving faster than a bullet fired from a gun, three days to reach the moon<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>. Light travels that same distance in only one second.</p>
<p>Our sun is 93 million miles away. It takes light from the sun about eight minutes to reach us. Which, by the way, means that when we look at the sun, we don’t see it as it is right now; we see it as it was eight minutes ago. The next nearest star to us, Alpha Centauri, is four light-years away. That means it takes four years for light to travel from Alpha Centauri to Earth. Again, when we look through our telescopes at Alpha Centauri, we do not see it as it is right now but rather how it was four years ago.</p>
<p>It takes light 250 thousand years to travel from one side of the Milky Way Galaxy to the other. The next nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy. It is 2 MILLION light-years away, which means that, once again, when we look through our telescopes at the Andromeda Galaxy, we don’t see as it is now, but instead, we see it as it was 2 million years ago. The most distant galaxies that we see – those in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field – are over 13 BILLION light years away, which means that the light that Hubble collected had been traveling for billions of years. That means that our universe, created under the direction of our Heavenly Father, is inconceivably old.</p>
<p>Alma, in answering questions of his returned, prodigal son Corianton, said, “Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise [that is, be resurrected] it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not;” Why doesn’t it matter when people are resurrected?&nbsp; Because, as Alma continues to say, “All is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.”<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In other words, things work differently for God, BECAUSE He IS God. Both space AND time are His creations.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself said, “And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;President J. Reuben Clark Jr. once said, “Our Lord is not a novice, he is not an amateur; he has been over this course time and time and time again.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>So what does this have to do with my discussion of God being our heavenly parent?</p>
<p>In trying to understand the vastness of space and time, it is easy to feel a bit lost – to wonder how God can find and know each of us when the universe is so big. With Moses, we feel to say, “Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing.”<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>First of all, I want you to understand that God IS God. He isn’t some Hollywood version of a Greek or Pagan god. He isn’t a character who is mostly powerful or mostly perfect or mostly knows everything. He IS all-powerful. He IS all-knowing. He IS perfect. Most importantly, He IS all-loving. He IS the ultimate FATHER who loves His children above all else and is not only capable of, but is focused on, loving each individual one of us.</p>
<p>Just as my father was able to know and identify the right key to use or the right path to follow, which was so complex to my childhood mind, our Heavenly Father, who is the ultimate Father, knows the paths that we, as individuals, are following.</p>
<p>Not only was my dad able to navigate the complexities of the Salt Lake City road system, which I could not, he was also able to help me in other ways that I was incapable of helping myself.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve, I attended the wedding reception of my older brother James and his wife Janet just after they were sealed in the Washington, DC Temple. The reception was held in the cultural hall of an LDS church building. As part of the festivities and decorations, they had a large, multi-tiered wedding cake that was placed in a prominent place in front of the stage, with its curtains closed, at one end of the cultural hall. For most of the reception, I was free to wander and eat the provided snacks – my favorite part of any wedding reception. At some point, I noticed that one of my older sisters, Faithann, who is closest to me in age, was sitting on the stage with her back to the curtain. I have always been a bit of a tease, so I got it into my mind that it would be fun to startle my sister by sneaking up to her from behind the curtain. Carefully, I went back stage and then crept up to the curtain until I found the opening between the two sides. With a cry of “Boo!” I threw the curtains open.</p>
<p>My shout did, in fact, startle my sister as I planned. However, it caught everyone else’s attention as well. They all turned to look toward me just as one side of the curtains that I had thrown open hit the beautiful wedding cake, knocking it over…</p>
<p>The good thing is that my newly-married brother was standing, in his white tuxedo, next to the cake and managed to catch it. The bad thing is that, sitting on top of the cake, was a beautiful, miniature, crystal model of a temple. It had been borrowed from a ward member as a cake topping. Even now, I can see in my mind’s eye with clarity, and in slow motion, the fall of that crystal temple as a voice in my mind screamed “Nooo!” and it hit the ground and shattered into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Like Alma the Younger, I know what it is like to wish “that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body.”<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>I did not have the money to purchase a replacement for that temple, but my dad did. He did purchase a replacement, but it was not a free replacement. When we got home, I was given a long list of chores to do to pay my dad back for doing what I could not.</p>
<p>My father replaced the temple AND required me to put in effort to complete the chores because he loved me and wanted me to learn a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father does the same.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith said, “Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity, and ought to be manifested by those who aspire to be the sons of God.”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Andrew C. Skinner, while speaking at a BYU Devotional in April of 2006, said, “Our Father in Heaven loves me, and He loves you. His love is not a zero-sum exercise. He does not love me less and you more because there is only so much love to go around. His love is infinite. He loves me when I think or act a little like the prodigal son, and He is patient with me when I think or act a little like the jealous older son. In truth, during our years of mortality, are we not all, even just a little bit, like both the prodigal son and the steady but jealous older brother? Does our Father in Heaven cease to be interested in our welfare when we are sinful and we need to come to ourselves? Does He turn off His care and concern for us when we are bad and turn it on again when we are good? I do not think so. The Father’s love is as broad, deep, and lasting as eternity. It encompasses all.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>I will repeat again, God IS God. God IS our Father. God loves us.</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father gave His Son Jesus Christ to die for us so that we could recover from our mistakes and sins, be forgiven, and return to live with Him. Just as my dad replaced the crystal temple that I could not, and then required me to do chores, Christ paid the debt of our sins and requires us to emulate His life and repent of our sins.</p>
<p>There is another way, though, that God has shown His love for us and His knowledge of us as our Father.</p>
<p>One of the most famous sculptures in the world is the <em>Pietà</em>, a carving in marble of the Savior, just after being taken from the cross, in the lap of His mother Mary.</p>
<p>I’m a geologist, so let me tell you a little about the rock that the statue is carved from. It is called Carrera marble and is a rock of very high quality that has been used in art and buildings since at least the time of the Roman Empire. Its beauty comes from its purity. Now, normal marble is one of the most common rocks on Earth. Marble is a metamorphic rock, which means that it used to be another kind of rock that over time has been changed, due to heat and/or pressure, into another kind of rock. In the case of marble, it originally came from a rock called limestone, which is also very common.</p>
<p>Limestone is a sedimentary rock that usually forms from sediments in warm, tropical water. The sand and coral that makes up most of the beaches and reefs of Oahu is future limestone.</p>
<p>Thus, the process of forming marble first requires sediments being deposited in a warm, shallow ocean environment. These sediments must then be compressed and cemented into rock – that is, into limestone. In order for that limestone to then become marble, like Carrera marble, it has to be buried deep within the Earth until it is cooked under high enough heat and pressure that it is chemically and mechanically altered into a new type of rock. Each of these processes takes millions of years.</p>
<p>Carrera marble, though, wasn’t originally formed from just any sediment. It was not formed from normal beach sand like we find here on Oahu. The thing that makes Carrera marble special is that the original sediments that produced it were exceptionally consistent and pure<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>. This original uniformity and purity of the sediment created a consistency that was preserved in the structure of the rock from sand to limestone and then from limestone to marble. It is this that makes Carrera marble such great rock for carving.</p>
<p>So what? Why is understanding the process of how Carrera marble formed important?</p>
<p>Well, where was Michelangelo born? Was he just born anywhere? Or was he born in a location where, as he grew and developed his talents, he had access to some of the world’s greatest sculpture material? I suggest to you that it was not by accident that one of the world’s greatest sculptors was born near some of the world’s greatest marble.</p>
<p>As Michelangelo’s Heavenly Father, God knew exactly what resources Michelangelo would need in order to develop his talents and progress through life. The planning and preparation for those resources began millions of years before the birth of Michelangelo. They began in a warm, shallow ocean where exceptionally pure sediment was formed.</p>
<p>Remember, God IS God. Under His direction, “the worlds were created,” not just in space but also in time.</p>
<p>Do you think that God only planned for Michelangelo? This universe, in all its vastness, was created for one purpose. God, Himself, has said, “For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God knows you individually and PLANNED for you individually. He knew exactly what you would need in this life. All of the resources that you use on a daily basis – whether that is the copper in the wiring that allows you to read under an electric light or receive a text message, or the oil that is burned to produce the electricity in the light, or the soil that feeds the plants that produce the food that you eat, or the pigments in the paint that you use to paint your house, or the wood that is made into a violin. All of those things, and countless others, were planned, prepared, and made in order that you, individually, would be provided for in this life to develop your talents.</p>
<p>I am staggered just trying to envision the complexity of such planning – billions of years’ worth of processes so that YOU (and everyone else who has ever lived) could have everything needed to grow and progress in this life.</p>
<p>That is what it means to be a God – to be a loving Father, who knows and provides for the needs of His children – without any limitation in time or space. He knows you. When He and His Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith, the first thing He did was call Joseph by his first name.</p>
<p>I think that too often we think of being a Heavenly Father as just one of many characteristics that make God God. My suggestion to you is that it is His fatherhood that is His most important characteristic.</p>
<p>Despite the vastness of space and time, God IS God, and not only is He capable of knowing you, He has been and is focusing on you as an individual.</p>
<p>Let me close with two quotes, one by Elder Neal A. Maxwell and the other by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf.</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell has said, “We know the Creator of the universe is also the Author of the plan of happiness. We can trust Him. He knows perfectly what brings happiness to His children. Meanwhile, as some experience daily life situations in which they are or feel unloved and unappreciated, they can nevertheless know that God loves them! His creations so witness. Therefore, we can confess His hand in our individual lives just as we can confess His hand in the astonishing universe.”<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>President Uchtdorf, in the 2011, October General Conference, said the following:</p>
<p>“My dear brothers and sisters, it may be true that man is nothing in comparison to the greatness of the universe. At times we may even feel insignificant, invisible, alone, or forgotten. But always remember—you matter to Him! ... Please understand that what you see and experience now is not what forever will be. You will not feel loneliness, sorrow, pain, or discouragement forever. We have the faithful promise of God that He will neither forget nor forsake those who incline their hearts to Him.</p>
<p>“Have hope and faith in that promise. Learn to love your Heavenly Father and become His disciple in word and in deed. Be assured that if you but hold on, believe in Him, and remain faithful in keeping the commandments, one day you will experience for yourselves the promises revealed to the Apostle Paul: ‘Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>).</p>
<p>“Brothers and sisters, the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit. He knows you. He loves you with a perfect love. God sees you not only as a mortal being on a small planet who lives for a brief season—He sees you as His child. He sees you as the being you are capable and designed to become. He wants you to know that you matter to Him.”<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>I add my own personal witness and testimony to President Uchtdorf’s. I know that God lives. I know that He is our Father. I know that He is a glorified man and that each of us, His sons and daughters, can one day be like Him. Just as I now am a father of my own children, someday I can be like my Father in Heaven who loves us all. When He tells us, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not,”<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;it is because He really does have a perfect knowledge of us and our needs. May you all be blessed with the true knowledge that you are a son or daughter of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>January 27, 2015<br />Helena Hannonen<br />Professor of Business Management<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Dear sisters and brothers, aloha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak about leadership not only for this life but for the eternities. I pray that the Holy Ghost might convey my message in a way that will answer some of the questions you may have about your role and mission as a leader. Leadership is one of the core values and objectives of Brigham Young University–Hawaii, yet only a few of you will have formal leadership courses while you are here. Do not despair. The lessons are all around you as are the opportunities to practice your skills as a leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership is the power to influence others to follow in a given situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The late Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, “Some sincerely wish for more power in order to do good, but only a few individuals are good enough to be powerful”&nbsp;(“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-tugs-and-pulls-of-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank">Tugs and Pulls of the World</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2000).</p>
<p>This is a selfie generation, and pictures taken on beaches, mountains, shopping centers, with plates of food and every facial expression imaginable are uploaded to Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, and Twitter. How long will they last? An hour? A week or two? Taking pictures of others has turned around to “me”-centered pictures. As fleeting as “selfies” are on social media, once those in power or in the limelight have exhausted their use for others, they push people aside. Fame and fortune can be obtained in many ways, but the true leadership has personal righteousness at the center. Many, just like Judas Iscariot, sell their masters for money or special deals at any given moment that suits their personal goals, but great leaders are humble and meek and wait upon the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell warned us, “Personal righteousness, worship, prayer, and scripture study are so crucial in order to ‘[put] off the natural man’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:19</a>). Whether young or old, we need to be good friends, but also to pick our friends carefully. By choosing the Lord first, choosing one’s friends becomes easier and much safer. Consider the contrasting friendships in the city of Enoch compared to peers in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah! The citizens of the city of Enoch chose Jesus and a way of life, then became everlasting friends. So much depends on whom and what we seek first” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-tugs-and-pulls-of-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank">Tugs and Pulls of the World</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2000).</p>
<p>You came here to gain an education. Obtaining a degree should be your main focus. A vision without action is daydreaming, but actions without a vision turn quickly into a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sons of Mosiah were faithful, strong, and powerful. They “had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God… But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God” (Alma 17:2-3).</p>
<p>Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni influenced many to come to Christ in other lands. Was it easy? No. Did they expect that they were entitled to get things for free? No. “They had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the spirit” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Alma 17:5</a>).</p>
<p>Being a leader was not easy then nor is it easy now. It takes hard work, preparation, practice, and more work. There are people who slap the title “leader” on their foreheads, declaring “I am a leader” without knowing what leadership is. Others appoint a person as a leader and hope for the best. Matthew warned, “And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/15.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">Matthew 15:14</a>). Bad leaders destroy people and organizations. The book of Proverbs states, “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/29.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Proverbs 29:2</a>).</p>
<p>Becoming a great leader is a process. We often have an image of a perfect leader. If we were perfect leaders, I would be standing here in my size two business suit, with long thick hair and high heels, speaking perfect English with a British accent. President Wheelwright would be Batman and Vice President Max Checketts would be his sidekick Robin. The only one who matches the image is Sister Wheelwright because she is a Wonder Woman. To become great leaders, we all need to go through a transformation.</p>
<p>Jesus asked Simon and his brother Andrew to leave their nets to become fishers of men. They followed the Savior immediately. Jesus Christ, the perfect leader, taught them, worked and ate with them, mentored, gave them assignments they could perform, and gave the vision of things to come. The Savior loved Peter, but his communication was direct and his feedback corrective. Some may see Peter as a flawed man with little faith who started to sink when he tried to walk on water towards the Savior, but Jesus Christ saw his potential, and the fisherman Simon was transformed into Apostle Peter, the great leader and head of the early church.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke about challenges leaders face: “There is a great loneliness in leadership. This is so because we have to live with ourselves even if it means abandoning other relationships and pursuits. We have to live with our own consciences. We have to live up to our inner feelings. We have to stand for the values and beliefs that we have embarked, adopted, and woven into our character…The price of leadership is loneliness.” (“<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=1563" target="_blank">The Loneliness of Leadership</a>,” Brigham Young University Speeches, 4 Nov. 1969.)</p>
<p>My mother, who turned 93 last week, always emphasized that the public and private persons needed to be the same. When I was a little girl, I went to a store for my mother. In my purse, I had money and a list of things I was to get. The storekeeper took the list, and once I received the items, I handed her the money. I was then given some change and a receipt. I returned home where my mother checked everything. One time, I had received too much money back. Mother took me to the store with the extra money. When the storekeeper laughed, Mother informed her that my integrity was not for sale for a few coins then or for millions when I grew up. Once I tried to get away with something by saying, “But everyone else does it.” That didn’t work. This tiny woman said that I was not just everybody; I was a member of Hannonen family and a citizen of Finland. Once we were converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, she added “Mormon” to the list. “Remember who you are” has played in my mind before there were iPads or iPods, MP3 players, and truthfully, before there were computers, electric typewriters, or color TV.</p>
<p>I had temptations similar to the ones you face today, but I made choices based on moral and ethical values taught to me in my childhood. Later in life, it did not matter to my mother what place I had in an organizational chart, how many people I was responsible for, or how much money moved through my hands. What mattered was that I had clean hands and a pure heart and that I was working towards eternal goals in the kingdom of God. I cannot give a resume of my accomplishments to the Lord, only myself and who I have become during my time in mortality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are making the transition to the world of adults and productive years in the labor force. You are taking on leadership responsibilities. You are learning that things that were acceptable in your childhood are not so now. You will also find out that people caught up in themselves will let others down. They will not keep their promises. They may even take your bread and with laughter brush it away as “borrowing” permanently with no intention to return what they have stolen. Some people never learn to move past temper tantrums of a two-year old when they want something. You will start families of your own and will be responsible for yourselves and others. You will also pass on your traditions and values to your children. In essence, you will be training the next generation of leaders.</p>
<p>We are often conflicted in our values and those of others in our midst. The validation of our worth and our confidence come from knowing who we are, not just what we do. Jesus answered the question “What manner of men (and women) ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:27</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Matthew 5:48</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pay attention to what you are and how you behave in different situations. Never let anyone stop you from the blessings of renewing your covenants when partaking the sacrament or attending the temple. If you lose sight of your covenants, the only person you hurt is yourself … and maybe next generations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mother was a young chemist who had to stay behind during two wars when she was between 18 and 22 years old. Others in her family were evacuated. She lived in a time of violence but always had that inner peace that passeth understanding (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Philippians 4:7</a>). She knew how to be still because the Lord was on her side. All she had to do was bear her cross patiently. She left it to God to order and provide in her life, remaining faithful in every change she encountered. She knew there would be a joyful end. And so it was when Elders Rex Call and Wayne Hassell brought the gospel of Jesus Christ to our home, and we chose to follow the Savior. Her joy was complete when she was sealed to my father who had died at the age of 32 and left her with two small children. Her eternal vision was clear, and she is enduring to the end.</p>
<p>I was in your shoes many years ago as a shy foreign student at BYU Provo. I know the feeling of being rejected because you have an accent, look and dress differently, have different values and customs, like to eat different foods, and have no family close by. However, learning new things and meeting fascinating people from all over the world wiped away any negative feelings. I felt like the luckiest girl in the universe. And I was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew I was brought to this “land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted” with Father Lehi to his children and to “all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 1:5</a>). I took Lehi’s warning seriously when he said that people would only prosper as long as they kept the commandments of God and did not “reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">2 Nephi 1:10</a>). Trials come to even those who are righteous. We are here to be tested in all aspects of mortal life. Never lose sight of staying the course and keeping the commandments and your covenants; there is safety and promise when you do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You, too, have been brought to this country by the hand of God and have a special mission on earth. You are at BYU–Hawaii to integrate both spiritual and secular learning, and to become people with character and integrity who can provide leadership in their families, their communities, their chosen fields, and in building the kingdom of God. This is a time to prepare to become leaders, to mold your character so that you can be trusted to take additional responsibilities once you leave this university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaders communicate effectively in multiple languages. I love the following story:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Captain Moroni and Pahoran were direct in their style of communication (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma?lang=eng" target="_blank">Alma 59-61</a>). As the battle raged against the Lamanites, Moroni requested help from Pahoran. No troops, food, or weapons came, and many people were killed. Moroni was angry and sent a message to Pahoran. He accused Pahoran for being idle, not caring, and many other things. Then he told Pahoran to repent and asked him for help. Pahoran was the chief judge and wrote back explaining his situation. Eventually, they were able to work out their differences, restore the government, and regain the city of Zarahemla. Moroni was about your age or 25 when he was appointed chief captain. He was great in military strategy and led his people by divine guidance. He trusted God, and people trusted Moroni.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good leaders are direct in their communication and responses and ask for help. Do not harbor ill feelings towards others when you might not know their situation. Problems, which are not talked about, cannot be resolved. Tired and angry leaders make fatal mistakes with people and organizations. Great leaders of the Book of Mormon communicated, planned, collaborated, and helped restore peace. Most importantly, they were led by the Lord.</p>
<p>Leaders also take time to ponder and rejuvenate their minds and bodies. The Savior retreated to the desert or mountains to meditate, ponder, and pray during his ministry.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to do is swimming. My second favorite thing is hiking in the forest and mountains. I worked summers as a lifeguard and swimming teacher in high school. There was a two-week break before school started, and during that time, I went to the wilderness above the Arctic Circle, which is mostly inhabited by bears, wolves, and reindeer. There were times when I was hurt but had to keep moving. I learned that it is in those lonely, difficult times that we learn what we are made of and that we matter. Our prayers are heard, and we learn to listen to the Spirit and be guided. All our senses become sharper, and we become aware that we are not alone anywhere. There are unseen hands to guide and help us.</p>
<p>Each person must travel through his or her own personal wilderness. Don’t be afraid, have faith in every footstep, and you will come out on the other side. You will find a friend in yourself and a firm, reliable guide in the Lord. There is also the promise from the Lord that when you are faithful to your covenants and keep the commandments, “His angels will be round about [you], to bear [you] up and have charge over [you]” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88?lang=eng#87" target="_blank">D&amp;C 84:88</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank"> D&amp;C 109:22</a>).</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith added this: “We are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors … who have preceded us into the spirit world. …We live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. For now they see the dangers that beset us; … their love for us and their desire for our well-being must be greater than that which we feel for ourselves” (Conference Report, Apr. 1916, 2–3; see also <em>Gospel Doctrine</em>, 5th ed. (1939), 430–31).</p>
<p>Effective leaders have the ability to establish relationships, develop people, and attract talent. They find connections, build high performing teams, and elevate everyone in an organization. I hope that you connect with others often so that they know you care and love them. To have a real friend next to you when you are lonely is much better than 100 friends in cyberspace who simple respond “like” to your plea for help.</p>
<p>My mission president, Kirt M. Olson in the Colombia Bogota Mission, listened to know the heart of his missionaries. He connected us to the ancient Book of Mormon leaders and living prophets of our time. He was friends with President Spencer W. Kimball. Both had a great love for the children of Lehi. These men were shorter than I am physically, but to me, they seemed giants. I was a Welfare Services missionary and trained local leaders. President Olson’s question was always, “Hermana Hannonen, if you were in my shoes, what would you do?” I gave him my recommendations and justifications. What surprised me was that he implemented those recommendations right away. I knew I was valued, my opinions mattered, and my confidence grew. I worked harder and better all the time.</p>
<p>President Olson also encouraged missionaries to find better ways of teaching the gospel to more people. Returning back from a district conference, one elder pointed to lonely huts and yelled from the back of the bus, “Hermana Hannonen, how are you going to take the gospel to those people?” Others laughed! I paused, turned around, and responded, “We are going to teach the gospel on radio.” There was a long silence. I continued, “President Kimball in his dedicatory prayer of Colombia said that the people would hear the gospel preached on their transistor radios… and we are going to do just that.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Missionary work is not for the faint in heart. The next day, my companion and I went to all the radio stations in the city and asked them to play tapes from Bonneville International, which included music and messages of inspiration. No one accepted our proposal, but the director of the last station looked at me and said, “I want you to make the programs.” In shock, I said, “Si, senor!” and walked out. Neither my Colombian companion nor I had any idea how to do this, but President Olson did: everything had to come from the scriptures and printed LDS Church materials. The first program was on the following Sunday morning. The topic was the appearance of Jesus Christ on the American continent after His resurrection. When these words, “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him” (3 Nephi 11:7) were carried over the radio waves to far away huts in that region, we cried because the Spirit changed everything, and we felt it. There became a tangible transformation in missionaries, members, the whole city, and the mission.</p>
<p>Listen to your leaders and those who have walked the path before you. As students and employees of BYU–Hawaii, we are fortunate to have great leadership lessons, vision, strategy, and guidance from many servants of the Lord who visit our campus. Their speeches are made available on the BYU–Hawaii website. We need to read and study them carefully and align ourselves with the vision and goals.</p>
<p>Another great leader who has influenced my life is Victoriano Pinacue, the chief of Paez Indians in Tierradentro, Colombia. President Olson’s 18-year old daughter Linda and I were told to get on a bus and then follow the Spirit. We had no place to sleep, knew no one, and were on our own. Like Indiana Jones in movies, we took steps into the darkness, and a pathway would open up before us. Within a couple of days, Sister Olson and I knew we needed to climb higher and find the Paez. We were on our sixth hour of going up the mountain path one late afternoon when we encountered Chief Victoriano. He turned around and walked and talked with us while one rode his horse. He told us to go and spend the night with the Catholic nuns two hours away, and he would come and meet us the next morning. I didn’t sleep much that night, but there was no fear. I knew that the Lord had guided us and would not leave us alone.</p>
<p>The story of Ammon came alive when we were invited to go to the Chief’s home. We worked and taught the family welfare principles, held Primary, and preached the gospel. When there was enough trust, Victoriano shared what had preceded our first meeting on the mountain path. He asked why we were so late? Late? He and others had dreams of two blonde girls with blue eyes coming to the mountains, and they had been waiting for us for two weeks. Then, this Chief told us about the white god who had come hundreds of years ago to his people and bathed in the lake near by. He shared the teachings of the white, bearded god and how he was told to treat strangers and discern their intensions.</p>
<p>I kept records of what happened on those mountains. It has been decades but my letters, journal entries, and pictures are all anyone has of that time with the Paez Indians. To help us keep clear focus, we need to keep records and measure our progress. I was a student when President Spencer W. Kimball encouraged all to keep a journal. I wrote a letter every week to my mother. She has kept my letters and those received from my friends. She filed them by year for decades. I am sure that one day I will come up with a more exciting title than “Helena Hannonen: A Life in Letters” for my personal history book.</p>
<p>President Kimball said, “What could you do better for your children and your children’s children than to record the story of your life, your triumphs over adversity, your recovery after a fall, your progress when all seemed black, your rejoicing when you had finally achieved?” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/12/president-kimball-speaks-out-on-personal-journals?lang=eng" target="_blank">President Kimball Speaks Out on Personal Journals</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Dec. 1980, 61).</p>
<p>The Lord commanded Nephi to make plates of ore that he might engrave upon them the record of his people. Surely, you can take notes in your classes, Tweet, and write or videotape a record of your life. Every great leader I know has a notebook or a device to capture ideas and inspiration that come to their minds as well as to ensure that what needs to be done actually happens. Put your joys and sorrow on paper and leave them there. The worst note is better than the best memory because we so easily forget important things.</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott counseled us, “Inspiration carefully recorded shows God that His communications are sacred to us. Recording will also enhance our ability to recall revelation. Such recording of direction of the Spirit should be protected from loss or intrusion by others” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life?lang=eng" target="_blank">How to Obtain Revelation and Inspiration for Your Personal Life</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 2012).</p>
<p>I know leaders who have kept their journals in the language of their mission to maintain their language fluency. Others write to learn or improve a language. My brother, who did not want to participate family home evenings but was in charge of keeping the records, wrote the minutes in Russian, so my mother and I couldn’t understand them. Nevertheless, that book is a treasure to our family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we die, our life continues. Looking at things from an eternal perspective, we see that Jesus Christ is the perfect leader and manager. He provided the vision and direction for our lives. Just think of the planning that went into creating this world and everything that is in it. Jesus Christ has a vision for us. He knows our divinely appointed missions on earth and our place in the universe. Jesus had to recruit spirits who would follow the Father’s Plan of Salvation. “Under the direction of our Heavenly Father, Jesus led us in God’s plan for pre-mortal, mortal, and post mortal life. Imagine the logistics involved in directing billions of sons and daughters through the process. We were there, shouting for joy just for the opportunity to come to earth.” (Paramore, James M. <a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=372" target="_blank">“Leadership – Jesus was the Perfect Leader</a>,” BYU Speeches, 22 Aug. 1989).</p>
<p>We accepted and followed the leadership of Jesus Christ. We took our assignments with families in different countries. We are all brothers and sisters, children of heavenly parents. Like prodigal sons and daughters, we will return to our eternal home from faraway lands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma instructed us, “For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. … For that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32,%2034?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Alma 34: 32, 34</a>).</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell described the tugs and pulls of the world by saying, “Many individuals preoccupied by the cares of the world are not necessarily in transgression. But they certainly are in diversion and thus waste ‘the days of [their] probation’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:27</a>). For true believers, the tugs and pulls of the world—including its pleasures, power, praise, money, and preeminence—have always been there. Now, however, many once-helpful support systems are bent or broken. Furthermore, the harmful things of the world are marketed by pervasive technology and hyped by a media barrage, potentially reaching almost every home and hamlet. All this when many are already tuned out of spiritual things, saying, ‘I am rich, … increased with goods, and have need of nothing’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/3.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Revelation 3:17</a>)” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-tugs-and-pulls-of-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank">Tugs and Pulls of the World</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 2000).</p>
<p>President Kimball emphasized that Jesus used his time wisely. “Time cannot be recycled. When a moment has gone, it is really gone.” Wise time management is really wise management of ourselves” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/08/jesus-the-perfect-leader?lang=eng" target="_blank">Jesus: The Perfect Leader</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Aug 1979).</p>
<p>President Brigham Young, whose name this university bears, urged us, “Say to the fields, … flocks, … herds, … gold, … silver, … goods, … chattels, … tenements, … possessions, and to all the world, stand aside; get away from my thoughts, for I am going up to worship the Lord” (<em>Deseret News</em>, 5 Jan. 1854, 2). There are so many things that pull us from our course to the ways of the world; leaders know themselves and have clear focus and say to the world, “Stand aside.” &nbsp;As global leaders, we are accountable to the Lord for our thoughts, words, and actions. Sometimes, it is for not taking any action when we should. People have the right to have competent leaders. Leadership is not taken nor is it just a position. It is the power to influence others to follow. Jesus drew people to him: women, children, men, sick, and outcast. He only offended and antagonized those who were impure and evil. His personal righteousness drew people to him, and he was able to teach and minister to people.</p>
<p>The hand of the Lord has brought us together at this time in this university. Some of us have a special mission and will be accountable for how we have taught the students in our care to become leaders with integrity and character. Students will be accountable for how they have used their time and opportunities to build those leadership skills. May we study and learn to lead as the Savior did. May the Holy Ghost be our constant companion and guide in this endeavor so that we may fulfill the measure of our creation here in mortality and in the eternities. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>January 20, 2015<br />Kevin J Worthen<br />President, Brigham Young University<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="zimport">Every April the Area Seventies from throughout the world gather in Salt Lake City, along with the General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies, for instruction from members of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presidency of the Seventy. The instruction focuses on the most fundamental and most pressing issues of the Church—things like temple work, strengthening members, the Atonement, and hastening the work of salvation. It is a privilege to sit at the feet of these inspired leaders and to learn what is on their minds and in their hearts.</p>
<p class="zimport">Two years ago, in April 2013, President Thomas S. Monson addressed the group and spent all of his time talking about just one topic: you—the youth of the Church. Think about that. Of all the important things that President Monson could have addressed—missionary work, temples, or Church leadership—he said that it was the youth of the Church that had been on his mind the most. He noted that as youth today, you are living in a time of infinite promise, a time when you will face unique challenges. He observed that you are truly a royal generation, reserved to come forth in this special time for particular purposes.</p>
<p class="zimport">President Monson’s remarks reminded me of two comments made by Elder Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell. Speaking to youth at a BYU fireside a number of years ago, Elder Maxwell said:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>The highest compliment I can pay to you is that God has placed you here and now at this time to serve in his kingdom; so much is about to happen in which you will be involved and concerning which you will have some great influence.</em><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">In another setting Elder Maxwell provided some additional context for that statement. Referring to the early days of this dispensation, he stated:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>The Church has done many difficult things, and from these achievements one would not wish to detract. But all the easy things the Church has had to do have been done. From now on it is high adventure!</em><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Now, Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the case. Those early stalwart Church members faced challenges that were daunting—challenges that would test the souls of the most valiant of us. However, Elder Maxwell did say that all the “easy things” that needed to be done have been done. “From now on, it <em>is</em> high adventure!” You have been reserved to come to earth at this time of high adventure because God knows you are capable of meeting the challenges which that adventure will bring.</p>
<p class="zimport">Today I would like to discuss with you a few ideas about what you might do to prepare yourselves to successfully encounter the high adventure that lies ahead of you, both individually and as members of God’s kingdom here on earth.</p>
<p class="zimport">My advice begins with a scriptural admonition, one that some of you will recognize as the Young Men and Young Women theme from two years ago: “Stand in holy places.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> If you are to succeed in your role in the high adventure that is in your future, you must be grounded in the strength that comes from worthily being in holy places, where you can feel and be strengthened by the Spirit. As the Church handbook makes clear, those “holy places include temples .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and chapels.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a>&nbsp;</sup>Regular church and temple attendance will bring great power in your lives—power you will need to face both the everyday and the extraordinary challenges you will encounter.</p>
<p class="zimport">But in today’s world, more will be expected of you than to just stand in holy places. My plea is not just that you stand in holy places but that you make holy the places in which you stand.</p>
<p class="zimport">As Sister Sharon&nbsp;G. Larsen, a former member of the Young Women general presidency, once explained:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Holy places can be wherever you are—alone, in a crowd, with strangers, with friends. The road to Jericho was treacherous and formidable. Thieves infiltrated the bushes and trees waiting to ambush any traveler. It took a kind and courageous Samaritan to change that road from a haunted place to a holy place.</em><sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">As followers of Christ, we are capable of doing more than standing in holy places. We can make any place holy—not just our temples and chapels but also our homes, our workplaces, and our locker rooms. We have the ability, like the good Samaritan, to change the areas in which we stand from haunted places to holy places.</p>
<p class="zimport">Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland illustrated how this can happen when he spoke of the experience of Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. If there were any place likely to be considered unholy or haunted, it would be that small jail, located near the western frontier of America, in the winter of 1838–39. As described by Elder Holland:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>The jail ... was considered escape proof, and it probably was. It had two stories. The ... main floor was accessible to the outside world only by a single small, heavy door. In the middle of that floor was a trapdoor through which prisoners were then lowered into the lower floor or dungeon. The outside walls ... were ... two feet thick, with inside walls of 12-inch ... logs. These two walls were separated by a 12-inch space filled with loose rock. Combined, these walls made a ... virtually impenetrable barrier four feet thick.</em><sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Joseph and his companions spent more than four months in that setting.</p>
<p class="zimport">Elder Holland continued:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>The food given to the prisoners was coarse and sometimes contaminated, so filthy that one of them said they “could not eat it until [they] were driven to it by hunger.” On as many as four occasions they had poison administered to them in their food, making them so violently ill that for days they alternated between vomiting and a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the Prophet Joseph’s letters, he spoke of the jail being a “hell, surrounded with demons ... where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.”</em><sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Elder Holland included further descriptions from Joseph Smith’s letters:</p>
<p class="zimport">“We have ... not blankets sufficient to keep us warm; and when we have a fire, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">“Our souls have been bowed down”<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup> </a>and “my nerve trembles from long confinement.”<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">“Pen, or tongue, or angels [could not describe] the malice of hell that I have suffered.”<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">That is not the kind of place that you or I would describe as holy. And yet it was in that setting that the Prophet received and recorded some of the most sublime revelations of this dispensation, including sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was so profound in that jail that B.&nbsp;H. Roberts, as Elder Holland noted, rightly referred to it as a “prison-temple.”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Surely if such a place can become holy, then the places in which we find ourselves can similarly be altered. Once again, as Sister Larsen stated, “Holy places can be wherever you are—alone, in a crowd, with strangers, with friends.” Or, as Elder Holland put it:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>We love and cherish our dedicated temples and the essential, exalting ordinances that are performed there. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are truly the holiest, most sacred structures in the kingdom of God, to which we all ought to go as worthily and as often as possible.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when you have to, you can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in <strong>any</strong> situation you are in. Indeed, let me say that even a little stronger: You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord <strong>in the most miserable experiences of your life—</strong>in the worst settings.</em><sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Haunted places truly can become holy places.</p>
<p class="zimport">So what do we need to do to have the power to make such a change in the places in which we stand? The first thing is to recognize that we cannot do this alone. No matter how good we are, no matter how talented we are, no matter how influential we are, we do not have the ability to make such changes on our own. The sole source of such transformational power is God. If we are to make haunted places into holy places, we need to tap into His power.</p>
<p class="zimport">How do we do that? Let me suggest a simple two-step process: We must first align ourselves with Him, and then we need to bind ourselves to Him. It is that simple. If we align ourselves with God and then bind ourselves to Him, we will be endowed with power to transform prisons into temples, humble dwellings into celestial abodes, and places of despair into havens of hope.</p>
<p class="zimport">So how do we align ourselves with God? He has indicated that the best way to do that is to believe in and align ourselves with His Only Begotten Son.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> We align ourselves with God by becoming true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ—by patterning our lives after His example. When we do that, we are changed in significant ways. As explained in the Church handbook:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>As we become true followers of Jesus Christ, we experience a mighty change of heart and “have no more disposition to do evil.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As we live the gospel of Jesus Christ, we grow line upon line, becoming more like the Savior in loving and serving others.</em><sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Let me suggest two simple practices that can help us come into more complete alignment with the Savior: daily scripture study and daily prayer.</p>
<p class="zimport">I know that these are not new suggestions. You have all heard them before, but I worry that in this regard we can—to use Alma’s words to his son Helaman — become “slothful because of the easiness of the way.”<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">When I was called as a bishop of a young single adult ward many years ago, our stake president was a wise, loving, and very seasoned priesthood leader. He had been a bishop, a stake president, and a mission president. He had seen it all. At one of our early training meetings he urged us to encourage our ward members to engage in daily scripture study and daily prayers. He said, “I have yet to find anyone who is studying the scriptures and praying on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments.”</p>
<p class="zimport">I must confess that the first thought that came to my mind—sparked perhaps by the skepticism that legal training seems to inculcate in people—was, “Surely that can’t be true. It is way too simple.”</p>
<p class="zimport">But I can assure you now, more than twenty-five years later, after having served as a bishop twice, as a stake president, and now as an Area Seventy, I have yet to find anyone who is studying the scriptures and praying on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments. It really is that simple. The daily practice of serious study of the scriptures and sincere prayer keeps the Savior enough in our minds and the Spirit enough in our lives that we will either make the necessary corrections to stay in overall alignment with the Savior or we will stop studying and reading the scriptures and praying because it is too uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="zimport">This does not mean you won’t have challenges or questions. You will. But daily scripture study and daily prayer will keep you on the path—will keep you aligned with the Savior and our Father in Heaven—to such a degree that you will find, over time, you are a better person, one more able to not only stand in holy places but also make holy the places in which you stand.</p>
<p class="zimport">But alignment with God in the abstract sense is not, by itself, sufficient to generate the power to transform our lives and the places we inhabit. We must not only align ourselves with God—we must also bind ourselves to Him. We need to draw upon God’s power not only to meet the challenges we face but also to be transformed by them. And we do that by binding ourselves to Him. As Elder Holland explained, “<em>Every</em> experience can become a <em>redemptive</em> experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">And how do we bind ourselves to God? Through covenants. As Sister Linda K. Burton once noted, “Making and keeping covenants means choosing to bind ourselves to our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ.”<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Covenants are “sacred and enduring promise[s] between God and His children.”<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> In the words of Elder D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson, “In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments.”<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">I think we sometimes underestimate the centrality of covenants in the gospel plan. It was only a few years ago I consciously recognized that the title of our scriptural collection of modern revelation focuses on covenants. We call those scriptures the Doctrine and Covenants. Maybe it would be more clear if we referred to it as the Doctrine and <em>the</em> Covenants, because those two things constitute the focus of revelation in this dispensation: the doctrine, meaning the principles of truth we need to understand, and the covenants, which lead us to employ and effectuate those truths in our lives.</p>
<p class="zimport">Covenants are so powerful because it is through covenants that God’s general promises are made operative in our individual lives. Elder Christofferson explained it this way:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Our covenants supply strength—they produce the faith necessary to persevere and to do all things that are expedient in the Lord. ... In the first place, the promised fruits of obedience become evident, which confirms our faith. Secondly, the Spirit communicates God’s pleasure, and we feel secure in His continued blessing and help. Thirdly, come what may, we can face life with hope and equanimity, knowing that we will succeed in the end because we have God’s promise to us individually, by name, and we know He cannot lie.</em><sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">My advice to you in this regard is the same as that given by the Lord to Emma Smith in section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants: “Cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.”<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> <em>Cleave</em> does not mean to casually and lightly grasp. It means “to cling or hold fast to; to attach oneself.”<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> The word <em>cleave</em> derives from the Old Norse word <em>klîfa,</em> which means “to ... climb by clinging.”<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> That is a pretty good visual image of how we can increase our potential for good. We climb upward by clinging, by hanging on with all our might to the covenants we have made with God, secure in His promise that He will keep His end of the agreement if we keep ours.</p>
<p class="zimport">If we do align and bind ourselves with God, it will make a profound difference both to the quality of our lives and to the lives of others in ways we may not fully recognize. Let me illustrate by reference to the image of a lighthouse.</p>
<p class="zimport">All of us are familiar with lighthouses. They send out a beacon of light that can hopefully be seen in the worst weather. They mark the line where the sea ends and the land begins—a very important marker for those who are piloting boats in bad weather. Lighthouses are fixed and immovable. They are constant, and sailors can therefore rely on them.</p>
<p class="zimport">But lighthouses also have another role to play for those who are piloting boats in bad weather. In addition to marking the place where the sea ends and the land begins, lighthouses can, with the help of other lights, guide sailors through treacherous waters where there are reefs and other unseen barriers that might sink the ship. In such situations there is often only one safe passage to the harbor, and the only way the pilot knows the ship is in that passage is by maneuvering the ship so that the light at the top of the lighthouse aligns with the carefully placed light on the shore. Once the ship is in that position, it can proceed safely, as long as those lights—the one in the lighthouse and the one on the shore—are in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship is off course, and there is considerable risk of a tragic shipwreck.</p>
<p class="zimport">In the October 2012 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer related an incident that explains this very well. On one occasion he was assigned to a stake conference in Western Samoa. As part of the conference the group had to travel from Savai’i to Mulifanua on Upolu Island. They had originally planned to go by plane, but weather conditions prevented that, so they set out on a forty-foot boat. What they did not know is that they were headed into the center of a ferocious tropical storm. After many hours they crossed the rough seas and arrived at the harbor at Mulifanua. President Packer explained what happened next:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>We arrived in the harbor at Mulifanua. There was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. A light on the hill above the beach and a second lower light marked the narrow passage. When a boat was maneuvered so that the two lights were one above the other, the boat would be lined up properly to pass through the dangerous rocks that lined the passage.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>But that night there was only one light. Two elders were waiting on the landing to meet us, but the crossing took much longer than usual. After watching for hours for signs of our boat, the elders tired and fell asleep, neglecting to turn on the second light, the lower light. As a result, the passage through the reef was not clear.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>The captain maneuvered the boat as best he could toward the one upper light on shore while a crewman held</em> [a] <em>flashlight over the bow, searching for rocks ahead. We could hear the breakers crashing over the reef. When we were close enough to see them with the flashlight, the captain frantically shouted reverse and backed away to try again to locate the passage.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>After many attempts, he knew it would be impossible to find the passage</em> [without the second light]. <em>All we could do was try to reach the harbor at Apia 40 miles (64 km) away. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the elements.</em><sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">The group eventually made their way to safety, but it was a harrowing experience. President Packer observed, “I do not know who had been waiting for us at the beach at Mulifanua. ... But it is true that without that lower light, we all might have been lost.”<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">Let me share a similar story:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>More than a hundred years ago, a well-known Protestant preacher, Dwight L. Moody, shared a story of a ship trying to enter the Cleveland harbor on a very stormy night.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>The ship’s captain could see the bright light of the Cleveland harbor lighthouse. However, the lower lights weren’t visible at all. The lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Because the lower lights were not burning that night, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>At the end of his sermon, Moody said, “Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights burning.”</em><sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">One of the members of Moody’s congregation that day was a man named Philip Paul Bliss, a musician. Bliss was so inspired by the lesson in Moody’s sermon that he wrote a hymn, which in our hymnbook is entitled “Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy.” Many of you will be familiar with the hymn. All of you should be. With the image of the lighthouse and these experiences in mind, listen to the first verse of that hymn:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Brightly beams our Father’s mercy<br /></em><em>From his lighthouse evermore,<br /></em><em>But to <strong>us</strong> he gives the keeping<br /></em><em>Of the lights along the shore.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Let the lower lights be burning;<br /></em><em>Send a gleam across the wave.<br /></em><em>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman<br /></em><em>You may rescue, you may save.</em><sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">The lighthouse of God’s love for His children is ever present and never moving. Some people will see it and will be drawn to it, but they may not know how to get to it. They will be looking for someone—some lower light—to show them the safe passage to that light. Their feelings may be like those found in a letter President Monson received from a less-active member of the Church: “I know where the Church is, but sometimes I think I need someone else to show me the way, encourage me, take away my fear, and bear testimony to me.”<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">There may be many around you in the places in which you stand who are in the same position. They want to do what is right, they want to have greater peace in their lives, and they want to come closer to God, but they are unsure of how to do it. Your example may provide the lower lights they need to see the safe passage. More may depend on your scripture study, prayer, and covenant keeping than just your well-being. Others may be affected by your doing these things as well.</p>
<p class="zimport">Let me close with an example of how one whose light was burning bright affected others and turned what was a haunted place, at least for one person, into a holy place. It comes from an article written by Rick Reilly, who in my opinion is one of the best sportswriters of our time. It was written in the fall of 2012. Because he writes so well, I will quote extensively from his version of the story:</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>In the scrub-brush desert town of Queen Creek, Ariz., high school bullies were throwing trash at sophomore Chy Johnson. Calling her “stupid.” Pushing her in the halls.</em> [Making it, I would say, a haunted place.]</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Chy’s brain works at only a third-grade level because of a genetic birth defect, but she knew enough to feel hate.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>“She’d come home every night at the start of the school year crying and upset,” says her mom, Liz Johnson. “That permanent smile she had, that gleam in her eye, that was all gone.”</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Her mom says she tried to talk to teachers and administrators and got nowhere. So she tried a whole new path—the starting quarterback of the undefeated football team. After all, senior Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>“Just keep your ear to the ground,” Liz wrote to Carson on his Facebook page. “Maybe get me some names?”</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>But Carson Jones did something better than that. Instead of ratting other kids out, he decided to take one in — Chy.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>He started asking her to eat at the cool kids’ lunch table with him and his teammates. “I just thought that if they saw her with us every day, maybe they’d start treating her better,” Carson says. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>It got better. Starting running back Tucker Workman made sure somebody was walking between classes with Chy. In classes, cornerback Colton Moore made sure she sat in the row right behind the team.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Just step back a second. In some schools, it’s the football players doing the bullying. At Queen Creek, they’re stopping it. And not with fists—with straight-up love for a kid most teenage football players wouldn’t even notice, much less hang out with. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>It’s working.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>“I was parking my car yesterday, and I saw a couple of the guys talking to her and being nice,” says offensive lineman Bryce Oakes. “I think it’s making a difference around here.”</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>And the best thing is? The football players didn’t tell anybody.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>“I didn’t know about any of this until three weeks ago,” says Carson’s mom, Rondalee, who’s raising four boys and a daughter by herself. “He finally showed me an article they wrote here locally. I said, ‘Are you kidding me? Why didn’t you tell me this?’”</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>All of a sudden, Chy started coming home as her bubbly self again. When her mom asked why she was so happy, she said, “I’m eating lunch with my boys!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>I get emailed stories like this a lot, but most of the time they don’t pan out. They turn out to be half true, or true for the first week but not the second. But when I walked into the Queen Creek High School cafeteria Tuesday, unannounced, there was 4-foot-high Chy with 11 senior football players, eating her lunch around the most packed lunch table you’ve ever seen, grinning like it was Christmas morning. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>“I thank Carson every chance I see him,” says Chy’s mom. “He’s an amazing young man. He’s going to go far in life.”</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Nobody knows how far Chy Johnson will go in life. The life expectancy of those afflicted with her disease, microcephaly, is only 25–30 years. But her sophomore year, so far, has been unforgettable.</em> [I might say it has been turned from a haunted place into a holy place.] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="zimport"><em>But what about next year, when Carson probably will be on his Mormon mission and all of Chy’s boys will have graduated?</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Not to worry. Carson has a little brother on the team, Curtis, who’s in Chy’s class.</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>“Mom,” he announced at the dinner table the other night, “I got this.”</em></p>
<p class="zimport"><em>Lucky girl.</em><sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="zimport">One person setting an example for others—who probably wanted to help but didn’t know how—and, all of a sudden, a haunted place became a holy place. If you make and keep sacred covenants, if you prepare yourself daily for spiritual experiences through scripture study and prayer, if you align and bind yourselves with God, a light will emanate from you. Others will be drawn to that light, which is just a reflection of God’s light, and they will be drawn to Him. As that happens, you will not only be able to stand in holy places but you will also make the places in which you stand holy for you and for others.</p>
<p class="zimport">I bear you my witness that God lives. He has a perfect plan for each one of us. He places us where we can help others. That plan includes the birth, Atonement, death, and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, who leads this work today. I bear you my witness of these elements of the plan and of the truths that have been restored through Joseph Smith, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>January 13, 2015<br />Steven C. Wheelwright<br />President, BYU-Hawaii <br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning and aloha! It is wonderful to be with you today at the start of this new semester. I’m grateful for the preparations that each of you has made to attend this Devotional and for the Spirit you bring to a setting such as this. My wife Margaret and I are delighted to be serving at this great institution at this special time. We have a great love for BYU–Hawaii and the students, faculty, and staff that make this such a special place. Thank you for your goodness and righteousness and your desire to learn and grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to focus my remarks today on one of the most important dimensions of our learning – the education of the heart. I recall first hearing this phrase in a talk given by President Hinckley as he shared his thoughts about learning and education. He said the following:</p>
<p>“Each day we are made increasingly aware of the fact that life is more than science and mathematics, more than history and literature. There is need for another education, without which the substance of secular learning may lead only to destruction. I refer to the <em>education of the heart</em> – of the conscience, of the character, of the spirit – these indefinable aspects of our personalities which determine so certainly what we are and what we do in our relationships one with another.”&nbsp; (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/08/with-all-thy-getting-get-understanding?lang=eng" target="_blank">With All Thy Getting Get Understanding</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, Aug 1988.)</p>
<p>Through the scriptures, we learn why educating our hearts is so important. The prophet Alma taught that the heart is an essential part of the soul, combining both the body and the spirit.</p>
<p>“Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, …when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say … that seed beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Alma 32:28</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other scriptures, we learn that the heart is the seat of true desires, “as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/23.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Proverbs 23:7</a>), and thus represents our true self. And as the Apostle Paul taught, the Lord himself knows “our thoughts and the intents of our heart” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/4.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Hebrews 4:12</a>) and thus can discern who we really are.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, the heart is the very essence of our identity. We “ponder” with our heart (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/2.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Luke 2:19</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">2 Nephi 4:16</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Moroni 10:3</a>); we “understand” with our heart (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/12.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">John 12:40</a>); we “discern” with our heart (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3.9?lang=eng#8" target="_blank">1 Kings 3:9</a>); and, it is with our heart that we are “inspired” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.48?lang=eng#47" target="_blank">Alma 43:48</a>) and “edified” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">D&amp;C 50:23</a>); finally, it is with our heart that we experience “joy” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">2 Nephi 1:21</a>) and “reverence” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">1 Peter 3:15</a>) and “peace” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">John 14:27</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">D&amp;C 109:38</a>).</p>
<p>This explains why Satan desires the heart of man – why the heart is his targeted battlefield – and why he is willing to go to any lengths to gain access to our hearts and thereby gain control over us. For example, through the scriptures, we know that Satan desires to “harden” our hearts (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/12.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">John 12:40</a>); to “tempt us” to let the world’s standards into our hearts (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/15.19?lang=eng#18" target="_blank">Matthew 15:19</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">D&amp;C 45:29</a>); to have us “remove our hearts” from God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Isaiah 29:13</a>); to treasure “the things of this world” and make them the focus of our heart (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Matthew 6:21</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.30?lang=eng#29" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:30</a>); and to have “pride” in our hearts (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">2 Nephi 28:15</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Jacob 2:13</a>).</p>
<p>In contrast to Satan’s approach, the scriptures teach that the Lord honors, respects and holds sacred our agency; He will not force us. But because He knows the blessings that come from filling our hearts with good things and with righteous desires, He continually invites us to follow Him in the desires and intents of our hearts (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">2 Nephi 33:1</a>).</p>
<p>As taught by Elder Gerald N. Lund, “[The Lord knows that] the heart is a tender place and that it is sensitive to many influences both positive and negative. It can be hurt by others. It can be deadened by sin. It can be softened by love. Early in our lives [and through the light of Christ and the Holy Ghost], we learn to guard our hearts. It is like we erect a fence around our hearts with a gate in it. No one can enter that gate unless we allow him or her to [do so]” (“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/opening-our-hearts?lang=eng" target="_blank">Opening Our Hearts</a>,” <em>Ensign</em>, May 2008).</p>
<p>One of the most important things we can do while here at this marvelous CES institution is to open that gate and gain an “education of the heart.” The extent to which we gain that education depends on what we prepare our hearts to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">receive</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embrace</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desire</span>. In turn, that “education of the heart” shapes our character, our conscience, and our spirit and thus determines our eternal destiny. In other words, that “education of the heart” determines who we really are.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn our attention to three key elements in the Lord’s plan for how we gain such an “education of the heart.” Notice that each of these three elements involves preparing our hearts.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Elements in an Education of the Heart</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>1 – Preparing our Hearts to Love the Lord and His Gospel</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First</span>, the Lord would have us prepare our hearts to love God and His son, Jesus Christ. We often think of this element when we think of missionary work. In fact, we frequently hear those who are willing to listen to this message from the missionaries referred to as the “honest in heart.” By that, we mean that they are willing to prepare, engage, and improve as they are taught the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Initially, this might entail listening to the missionaries, discussing gospel truths found in the Book of Mormon, and then praying to know if what they’ve learned is true.</p>
<p>In this process, the desires and intents of the heart are of critical importance. We see this in Joseph Smith’s own account concerning his search for which church he should join. As he wrestled with the challenge of determining which church was right, he read James 1:5 in the Bible. He then recorded in his own words, “Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did. … At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.11-13?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">JSH 1:11-13</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, young Joseph’s heart was prepared to receive the message that God had for him. Over the next several years, Joseph was tutored by Moroni and other heavenly messengers as he gained an education of the heart and learned to prepare, engage, and act and thus put the Lord and His gospel first in his life. I know that many of you have had the opportunity to serve a full-time mission and thus have seen first-hand this process of educating the heart by preparing to love the Lord and follow Him.</p>
<p>Let me share briefly one of the great blessings of my life, which involved sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with a good friend and colleague, John Chen, shortly after Margaret and I returned from presiding over the England London Mission. At that time, John and I were working together on a business school project in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we were traveling and meeting with people in China, we had an open Saturday in Beijing, and John agreed to take me to the Great Wall of China. As I was leaving the hotel, I had the distinct impression that I should take with me my small red travel copy of the Book of Mormon and find an opportunity to share a gospel message with John. As we rode out to the Great Wall, I began asking John about religious beliefs in China and what he knew of Jesus Christ. I quickly learned that he had no Christian background but that he was concerned with providing his son Kenny, then age 10, a moral framework for life. He thought that religion might perhaps offer that. We had a wonderful discussion of the Savior and His teachings, and I presented John with my travel copy of the Book of Mormon and invited him to read and pray about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon our return to Boston, I invited John, his wife Wei, and his son Kenny to attend church with us. While everything was new, they enjoyed it enough to join us the following week for a broadcast session of General Conference at our ward building. Within a short time, John and Wei had agreed to meet weekly for a discussion. Because they lived in the same ward as the Boston Mission President, which was not our ward, I set it up so John and his family could have Margaret and me join the missionaries one week and the Mission President and his wife join the missionaries the next week. John was diligent in his efforts to study, discuss, and apply the gospel and within a few months was ready to be baptized. The teaching continued and some months later his wife Wei and his son Kenny were baptized as was his daughter Susan who had been away at university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A year later, Margaret and I had the wonderful blessing of joining the Chen family at the temple, and I had the opportunity to perform the sealing for them. Let me share the two minute video of John’s testimony found on the Mormon.org website.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.mormon.org/john" target="_blank">Video</a>]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blessings of John and his family preparing their hearts to love the Savior and His gospel have only continued. A few years ago, their daughter Susan completed a master’s degree in accounting at BYU–Provo and met her eternal companion, and they were sealed in the Orlando, Florida temple. Six months ago, Kenny was called to serve in Paris, France as a Mandarin-speaking missionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a blessing it has been that John and his family were willing to be taught by the missionaries and the Holy Ghost and to prepare their hearts to love the Lord and His gospel. And like each of us, they have continued to deepen their testimonies by continuing to learn, engage, and improve through their scripture study, prayer, faithful church service, and regular temple attendance. <br /> <br /> So it is with each of us. The Lord desires that we educate our hearts by willingly putting Him, His commandments, and His kingdom first in our lives by putting them first in our hearts. This is the first great commandment, and it is central to our gaining the type of education spoken of by President Hinckley.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>2 – Preparing our Hearts to Love Our Neighbors as Ourselves&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">second</span> element in our gaining an education of the heart is preparing our hearts to love our neighbor. The scriptures teach that the second great commandment is to love our neighbor as ourselves (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/22.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">Matthew 22:38</a>), and six of the Ten Commandments are about how we treat our neighbors. Just as we prepare our hearts to love the Lord and His gospel by preparing, engaging, and improving, we prepare our hearts to love our neighbor in the same way. <br /> <br /> Some years ago, while serving as a Scoutmaster, I learned the importance of this second principle. When I first received the calling, I felt honored and also excited by the prospects. My dad had been a Scoutmaster for 18 years, most of my summer vacations had been at Scout Camp, I was an Eagle Scout, I’d attended a National Scout Jamboree, and I’d worked on the waterfront at a Scout camp for several years as a teenager. But I quickly discovered that I had much to learn about boys and about my role as the Scoutmaster.</p>
<p>From my experience as a Scout, I knew that we needed to include in our Scouting program activities that were fun and exciting but that also gave the boys a chance to learn and grow, so they would have a sense of accomplishment, confidence in facing the challenges of life, and the needed preparation for additional Priesthood responsibility and service. I had always loved skiing, so one of the first activities I selected was to take the boys to the slopes and teach them how to ski.</p>
<p>We made the needed preparations, and I enlisted the help of two other dads with skiing experience. The arrangements were to drive up to New Hampshire on a Friday evening, sleep in sleeping bags on the floor of a large rented condominium, and then take the boys skiing the next day before driving home on Saturday evening. As fate would have it, that week had been a particularly tough week for me at work, and I was exhausted by the time we arrived in New Hampshire and settled in at 10 PM that Friday evening.</p>
<p>While I was ready for a good night’s sleep, many of the 18 boys were not. They were excited and ready for a night of antics. By 1 AM, I was frustrated and even more exhausted. Each time I would fall asleep, some piece of clothing would come flying across the room, boys would start wrestling, or someone would need another drink of water or to use the bathroom. Two boys – brothers from a single parent home – had clearly picked up on my frustration and were making a game out of it. By 3 AM, when they finally dozed off, I’d had it. Then at 7 AM, they were up, waking the other boys, excited to have breakfast and get going.</p>
<p>In spite of the rough night, we had a successful day of skiing and all of the boys managed to learn the basics without getting hurt. We left the ski slopes, had dinner, and drove home, but I was dissatisfied with my negative memories of the night in the condo. I knew I needed some help and assistance or my tenure as Scoutmaster was not going to turn out well.</p>
<p>That Monday, I went jogging at noon with a close friend who asked me about the weekend ski trip with the Scouts. I told him what had happened and about my frustrations – especially with the two brothers – and then asked him for his advice. He thought about it and then asked a question which surprised me. He asked, “Do you love them?” I told him I thought I did, and he then asked, “Do they know you love them?” At that point, it struck me that, given the weekend’s experience, they might well conclude that I did not love them.</p>
<p>As I reflected repeatedly on my friend’s two questions, I concluded that he was correct. I would do much better, and so would the Scouts, if I really did love them and if I made sure they knew it. Over the next several weeks, I made a concerted effort to pray for greater love for my Scouts and to know how to show that love. While there were no major breakthroughs, there were lots of small wins, and over time as I got more dads and home teachers involved, we made great progress both with the Scouts and the Scouting program but more importantly in my relationship with each of the boys. We had many wonderful experiences, and I even had the pleasure of going as a leader with almost all of those same boys on a national Scout jamboree a few years later.</p>
<p>But I must admit that I was still never sure how much progress I was making with those two brothers. However, 10 years later, through a tender mercy, I learned that I had indeed made real progress. The ward had been split, and those two boys were no longer in our ward, but we continued to meet in the same building. One Sunday, I was in the foyer waiting to meet with the Stake President and the mother of those two boys happened to be speaking. She was talking about Priesthood holders that had made a difference in the lives of her boys. She related how she had overheard her son tell another friend that the only adult he felt he could trust was his Scoutmaster.</p>
<p>I was very grateful that day, both for a good friend who had pointed out the need to love my neighbor – in this case my Scouts – and for the gospel and the Holy Ghost for teaching me how to make real progress and to have it be apparent to those Scouts. The Lord desires that we willingly love others by understanding them, engaging with them, and letting that love guide our actions toward them.</p>
<p><em>3 – Preparing our Hearts to Learn with the Goal of Blessing and Serving Others</em></p>
<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third</span> element in gaining an education of the heart is learning to learn with the goal of blessing and serving others. This is what is meant by the motto found at each of the church schools: “Enter to learn, go forth to serve.” And, like the other aspects of preparing our hearts, this one also involves repeated cycles of preparing, engaging, and acting to apply what we have learned. This was the lesson that Oliver Cowdery needed to learn when he desired to translate. He thought that he could learn how to do so simply by asking, but the Lord taught him that he needed to do his part by “studying it out,” both in his mind and in his heart, and then asking God if it was right, and by the power of God, he would know if it was right (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">D&amp;C 8:2</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7-9?lang=eng#6" target="_blank"> 9:7-9</a>).</p>
<p>This is the same pattern that the prophet Nephi described over two thousand years earlier when he said that the Lord would give us line upon line and precept upon precept, and that if we then applied that knowledge, the Lord would give us more. Nephi then added that if we failed to apply what we have been given, we would begin to lose that learning and not be given more. I believe this principle applies directly to the learning each of you is involved in on this campus.</p>
<p>Here at BYU–Hawaii, our learning model is built on this foundation. It entails repeated cycles of preparing, engaging, and improving by applying what is learned. When we do our part in following this pattern – studying it out in both our minds and our hearts, asking for the Lord’s help, and then applying what is learned – our learning will continue to expand and grow. And when our desire to learn is motivated by faith, guided by the Holy Ghost, and centered on serving God by serving others, our learning not only grows but the rate of that growth accelerates.</p>
<p>While I could illustrate this with many examples from my own life, let me illustrate it using the example of my son-in-law Rob. Rob grew up in a family that loved airplanes and was fascinated by how they were made. His grandfather had been an engineer and eventually the CEO of an aerospace firm, and his dad had been in the air force. As a boy, Rob attended air shows, built model airplanes, and read everything he could about designing and making airplanes.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate at BYU, he studied mechanical engineering but became intrigued with composites and their use in airframe manufacturing. As a senior project, he designed, built, and tested a rocket made with composites. Fortunately for our family, he also met and married our daughter Kristen, which we are very happy about. He then went on to graduate school at Purdue earning a PhD in Aerospace Engineering.</p>
<p>Rob’s first job out of graduate school was as an engineer in a Division of Raytheon that manufactured business jets. Subsequently, he moved to Lockheed in Fort Worth, TX and continued to learn as he worked on the design and manufacture of the joint strike fighter aircraft. I discovered just how much Rob loved aircraft and learning about them when he and our daughter visited in London while we were on our mission there. One Saturday, we visited the air museum at Duxbury, England (near Cambridge) where they have six hangers filled with over 600 different aircraft. I learned that Rob knew details about each of those aircraft, their design, their manufacture, and their performance.</p>
<p>Over the years, Rob has become an expert not just at the engineering and manufacture of airframes using composites but also at the CAD models applied in doing so. He has continued his learning and is now a full-time faculty member in Engineering at the University of Texas where he is setting up a course on additive manufacturing using 3D printing and also establishing a lab that can be used by other faculty and their students. Rob loves helping students and seeing them succeed. While many years ago he entered a CES institution to learn and then went forth to serve, he continues to do so for the purposes of blessing his own family, his students, and all of those he works with.</p>
<p>He truly does his part to learn line upon line and precept upon precept by preparing, engaging, and improving by applying what he has learned and then repeating the process. While I don’t know a lot about airplanes, I love talking with Rob about them because he is always so excited to share what he has been learning. One of our key goals at BYU–Hawaii is to help each of you become that kind of lifetime learner by helping you prepare your heart to learn with the goal of blessing and serving your family and others.</p>
<p><strong>An Action Plan for Gaining an Education of the Heart</strong></p>
<p>While preparing our hearts – to love the Lord and His gospel, to love our neighbors as ourselves, and to love learning with the goal of blessing and serving others – is essential to gaining an education of the heart, simply recognizing the importance of these elements is not enough. Satan knows and understands their importance as well, and he knows that if he can gain control over what enters our hearts, he will be able to prevent us from gaining such an education. While Satan has many approaches for doing this, he most frequently tries to replace each of these kinds of preparation with something he knows will prevent us from moving forward.</p>
<p>For example, rather than let us develop a love for the Lord and His gospel, Satan seeks to shift our focus to the things of this world – be they fashion, fame, power, or material goods. He knows that if he can get us to put something – anything – other than the Lord and His kingdom first in our lives, he wins. The noted Christian writer, C.S. Lewis, summarized Satan’s approach thus:</p>
<p>“Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one – the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, [and] without signposts” (<em>The Screwtape Letters</em>).</p>
<p>When it comes to developing a love for our neighbors, Satan seeks to have us “accept” one or more of our personal weaknesses as either unimportant or as unchangeable or both. It could be a temper, impatience, selfishness, or any bad habit that interferes in our relationship with a neighbor. Invariably, anything that will get in the way of truly loving our neighbor by excusing or justifying our own shortcomings will accomplish Satan’s purposes.</p>
<p>And when it comes to developing a love for learning for the purpose of blessing and serving others, Satan needs only convince us either that we know enough and can stop learning or that we should pursue learning for personal gain, thereby preventing us from focusing on doing so for service. Eventually, he may get us to look for shortcuts and to compromise and reduce our love for the Lord and our neighbor as we increase our desire for personal wealth.</p>
<p>While these are some of the many ways Satan tries to control our hearts and hinder our desire to gain an education of the heart, a loving Father in Heaven has given us our agency, so we can choose what we prepare our hearts to receive, embrace, and desire. I would invite each of you to use that God-given agency to do so. Set a goal today to strengthen your education of the heart during your time here on campus.</p>
<p>You might begin this strengthening by making an assessment of the characteristics of your own heart by asking, “What adjectives would I use to describe my heart?” &nbsp;Or, “What adjectives would those who know me best use to describe my heart?”&nbsp; Each week or month, focus on strengthening one positive characteristic or overcoming one negative characteristic. Then pick another attribute to focus on improving in each subsequent week or month. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need help getting started, review Chapter 6 of <em>Preach My Gospel</em>, entitled “<a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-develop-christlike-attributes?lang=eng" target="_blank">How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?</a>” The entire chapter is focused on educating the heart. For example, the chapter suggests ways to develop a faithful heart, a hopeful heart, a loving heart, a virtuous heart, a learning heart, a patient heart, a humble heart, a diligent heart, and an obedient heart. The progress you make in strengthening your education of the heart will depend on how well you use your agency to prepare, engage, and apply what you learn as you seek to address each of these attributes.</p>
<p>My hope is that when you leave BYU–Hawaii, you will take with you a heart that loves the Lord and His Gospel, a heart that loves your neighbor, and a heart prepared to continue learning and serving others, wherever your paths may lead. This is the kind of education of the heart that we read about in the fifth chapter of Helaman.</p>
<p>You will recall that following an inspired and inspiring conference, King Benjamin “sent among [his people,] desiring to know … if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Mosiah 5:1</a>). The answer those people gave was, “Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, <em>or in our hearts</em>, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. …&nbsp; And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do His will, and to be obedient to His commandments” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2,5?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Mosiah 5:2,5</a>).</p>
<p>May we each strive to gain such an education of the heart by having a “mighty change of heart” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">Alma 5:40</a>) so that we may offer unto the Lord a broken heart and a contrite spirit, that when He shall appear we shall be like Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">1 John 3:2</a>).</p>
<p>This is my prayer and hope for each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
