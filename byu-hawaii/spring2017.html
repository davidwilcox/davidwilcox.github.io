<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
<p>It is a great privilege for me to speak to you today. I thank President Tanner, Professor Lee, the Executive Council, and others who have made this opportunity possible. I thank my many friends who have read and critiqued this speech, and I thank the Special Events staff for their invaluable help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my son has mentioned, my life has been greatly influenced by people from the islands of the sea and also by people from Pacific Rim countries. My youngest son Kimball lives with his family in Kobe, Japan. I’ve visited many Asian countries. In addition, I have spent many years in missionary service in the Pacific, nearly nine years of which were in Samoa. That service has been a great blessing for me and for my family. So, I am no stranger to the places from whence many of you have come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an introduction to my talk, I would like to present a wonderful Samoan proverb. <em>E lele le toloa, ae ma’au lona ua i le vai.</em>&nbsp;When a duck begins to fly out of the water, he crinks his neck looking back to the place from whence he came. The application is that when we leave our homes we always have a longing to return to them. I think this is true of people who have worked and lived in Laie — we are forever longing to return to this beautiful place. Such is the way I feel today. Indeed, this is a very pleasant experience for me, even with my crinked neck. And I’ll have more to say about this proverb toward the end of my talk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part One &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where did the present-day people of the islands of the sea come from?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scholars have developed a number of theories in answer to this question which seem reasonable enough. But the best source of information for Latter-day Saints comes from a letter written on 6 February 1911 by President Joseph F. Smith. The letter was written to honor a Maori chief but includes prophetic insight about all islanders. President Smith declared:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Brothers and Sisters, let us pause a moment and raise the question in your own minds, why you, in common with others of your race inhabiting the isles of the sea, were to be more blessed and favored of the Lord than the rest of the remnant of the House of Israel inhabiting this, our land of America? Was it because of any desire on the part of our Heavenly Father to bestow blessings upon you, upon your brethren and sisters in Samoa, Hawaii, Tahiti and other places, over and above those of your brothers and sisters, also of the House of Israel, living on the American Continent?</p>
<p>"No, it was simply because of your forefathers, who were first moved upon to occupy the isles of the seas, and who did so under the immediate overruling hand of the God of our Fathers, and were better than the rest of their brethren who occupied this continent, because they were more obedient and more faithful, the Lord in His superior wisdom, directed their course away from this continent to their island homes, that they might be separated from their more wicked disobedient brethren, that they might not be left to be preyed upon and destroyed by the more wicked part of the House of Israel . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This, dear brothers and sisters, is the key to your preservation as a nation, also to the preservation of your brothers and sisters of the other isles of the sea above mentioned, and this is the secret to the overruling hand of Providence which has been over you all, from that time until you received the gospel through the preaching of the elders . . ."</p>
<p>And we repeat, the reason that a few of the islands of the sea have been more highly favored and blessed than those of your brethren of this continent is, because of the worthiness of your forefathers who were led away and separated from their brethren of this continent, and because of the blessing of the Lord which has attended you, their children, from that time to the present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we learn from this insightful prophetic letter and from other prophetic utterances like it, are that the ancestors of the people of the islands of the sea are Book of Mormon people who went to the islands more than two thousand years ago. As President Smith said, they went there:</p>
<p>". . . under the immediate overruling hand of [God]; they were better than their brethren who occupied this continent; [God] directed [them] away from this continent to their island homes; that they might be separated from their more wicked and disobedient brethren; that they might not be left to be preyed upon and destroyed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since these bold assertions came from the pen of a prophet of God, I believe them to be true. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is obvious that the people President Smith identified were wonderfully righteous people who wanted to escape the wickedness and evil of their day; they wanted to go to a place where they could be preserved and live in peace and safety and honor their covenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Two</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, what Book of Mormon people would likely be the ones who traveled to the islands of the sea to escape the wickedness of their day by removing themselves from it?</p>
<p>A careful search of the Book of Mormon indicates that there were many of the children of Lehi who were true and faithful to their covenants. The Nephites did well from time to time, but they didn’t endure faithfully to the end. Their wickedness eventually led to their extinction, much like the Jaredites before them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the Lamanites, they were warlike people for many, many years, yet there is evidence that groups of them became obedient and peace loving people. One group, the plausible choice from whence Islanders came, would be the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi or the people of Ammon<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> named after that great missionary who was instrumental in converting them. While we don’t know a great deal about these people, we do know enough to consider them as the people who fit nicely into President Smith’s prophetic statement.</p>
<p>The people of Ammon were Lamanites who were converted to the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the preaching of Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni all sons of King Mosiah. These Nephite brethren and their companions went deep into Lamanite territory, at great personal risk, to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They did this after their own remarkable conversion because they desired:</p>
<p>". . . that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble."<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This fervent desire led to missionary work which brought thousands upon thousands<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> of Lamanites into the early Church of Christ which had been established by Alma, in the covenant and promised land of America. We must remember that these people had been a ferocious lot, murderers who had committed all manner of evil. Yet, in one of the most astonishing and remarkable miracles recorded in scripture, they had a mighty change of heart. They recognized, through Ammon’s teachings particularly, that they had to repent with full purpose of heart, turn away from their hostile ways, and show a sign to God that they had truly repented; they had to make and keep covenants with almighty God. They did this, fearing for their eternal lives because without showing a serious sign of full repentance before God and without making covenants, they knew that they could never gain eternal life and return to His presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The king of the people of Ammon said as much in one of the greatest, faith promoting, speeches ever delivered in the Book of Mormon or I think anywhere. He concluded the speech with these words:</p>
<p>"Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.</p>
<p>And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved."<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The sign they chose to make was a covenant unto the Lord to bury their weapons of war and never again stain them with the blood of an enemy, even at the peril and risk of their own mortal lives. And as you know, on one occasion, other hostile Lamanites came upon them<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> and, without resistance, slew more than a thousand of them before some of the attacking Lamanites were themselves converted. In truth, these wonderful covenant people of Ammon would rather die than break the covenant they made with God. That kind of faithfulness to covenants is rarely found anywhere, but these faithful Lamanites possessed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We remember, too, as another sign of their faithfulness and deep desire to please God, they raised up two thousand young Ammonite warriors who loved the Lord and who were true and faithful to their baptismal covenants. They were so faithful that they were willing to die to protect their families and loved ones so that they, in turn, could keep the covenant of not staining their weapons of war. These two thousand young men, later to be led into battle by Helaman<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>, were taught by their mothers to have great faith in Jesus Christ; they also had to be trained to fight and to look after each other in battle. They went to war and because of their full and complete faith in the Lord, not one was killed, even though they fought against one of the most seasoned and hardened Lamanite armies.<a href="#FN7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Imagine, you islanders are descendants of the most righteous people in the entire Book of Mormon. What a heritage you have! Oh, that we all could be as true and faithful as these wonderful Lamanite people, even the people of Ammon. Oh, to be such covenant people of the Lord!</p>
<p>Some people in the islands don’t like being associated with Lamanites. If they carefully studied the Book of Mormon however, they would discover the people of Ammon and surely would want to be their descendants. Or said in another way, who would not want to be a descendant of such marvelously favored and faithful people as the people of Ammon?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that the people President Smith is referring to are the people of Ammon who escaped the wickedness of their day. As righteous people, they were led out from among the wicked.<a href="#FN8"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;How they got to the islands is a question to be discussed another day, but they did and it is from these faithful, covenant people of Ammon, I believe, that most Polynesian islanders have descended.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is no evidence in the Book of Mormon that the people of Ammon ever broke the covenant which they made with God. However, over time, while living in those beautiful islands, their descendants lost their testimonies and forgot their covenants and for centuries those testimonies seemed to lie dormant until the latter-days, or in the time in which we live. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As President Smith seems to suggest, the seeds of the Gospel were planted in their very beings; there was a spark of divinity or a spark of belief which needed only to be aroused. It is as though when they were introduced to the Gospel, they heard the voice of the Good Shepherd,<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;and when missionaries arrived, they recognized His voice. Not only that, they resonated with the idea of covenants made with the Lord. There are many Islanders--Samoans and others I know who, like their ancestors, would rather die than break those covenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Three</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, what can we expect from the descendants of the people of Ammon?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because of their own and inherited faith, present day islanders have come into the Church in vast numbers and have embraced the Gospel of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me first speak of Tonga. Tonga has a total population of 104,941 with a Church membership of 60,680 or 57%. There are nineteen stakes in Tonga. Think about that! Here is a country, the only one in the world, where more than half of the people are members of the Church. Admittedly, Tonga is a small country, but even though small, it leads the world in percent of the people who are members of the Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know most about Samoa. At present, there are twenty-five stakes of the Church within the Apia Samoa Mission boundaries. Twenty stakes are in Samoa and five in American Samoa. According to latest Church statistics, of the total population of 188,889 in Samoa, 73,827 or approximately 39% of the population are members of the Church. Of the total population of 55,288 in American Samoa, there are 15,629 members or approximately 28% &nbsp;who are members of the Church. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And the growth is not just in Tonga and Samoa—other Pacific island groups indicate a similar strength:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiribati—total population is 100,786; Church membership is 16,279 or 16%. There are two stakes in Kiribati.</p>
<p>Cook Islands—total population is 14,974; Church membership is 1,862 or 12%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>French Polynesia—total population is 273,814; Church membership is 22,659 or 8%. There are nine stakes in Tahiti.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the first five countries in the world which claim the highest per capita LDS Church membership, live in Pacific Island nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Four</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What are the blessings present day Islanders should expect by remaining in or returning to their own countries?</p>
<p>I now want to focus attention on a stake conference held in American Samoa in 1970. At the time, I was the mission president, and President Boyd K. Packer was the visiting authority. I had traveled with him over an eight-day period throughout Samoa. He presided at a number of stake conferences and created a new one on the Island of Upolu. The conference in American Samoa was his last main assignment on his tour of Samoa. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the conference and of his speech he raised his arm to the square and pronounced an apostolic blessing upon the people. Among other things he said, he blessed the people and encouraged them to remain in Samoa. He said that if they did, they would be protected and most of the wickedness of the world would pass them by. I remember that apostolic blessing most vividly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what does that blessing have to do with you? Well, you are here at BYU-Hawaii to get as much education as you can. When your education here is completed, you then have the privilege of returning to your homelands to live under the security and safety of that and other apostolic blessings? I can’t imagine anyone not wanting that kind of protection especially when one considers the dangers of the world in which we live, even here in beautiful Hawaii.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now whether you have descended from ancient pioneer ancestors or whether you have descended from people who joined the Church more recently, or whether you are the first members of the Church in your family, they and you all can be considered covenant keepers. As for Islanders, it’s possible that among your ancestors were the people of Ammon, those faithful people who refused to break the covenants they made with the Lord Jesus Christ. As for the rest of you in this student body who come from other places in the Pacific, your ancestors didn’t travel there as Book of Mormon people, but they are pioneers nonetheless and, as members of the Church, they made covenants as well. Either way, your heritage is wonderful and your presence here is not by random chance. Indeed, you have left your homelands for a time to learn lessons taught by a faithful faculty here at BYU-Hawaii; now you return clothed in the armor of righteousness with a sound education, and with a renewed faith and testimony to honor those covenant keepers. This is your heritage!&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be sure there is a moral collapse all over the world and it is impossible to escape its influence wherever we might live including the islands of the sea, but with such apostolic blessings as having been pronounced on Islanders and the rest of you in your homelands, you have a better chance to escape most of the evils of our time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe all people are at their best in their own lands, in their own cultures, and speaking their own languages. This is not to say that anyone living in another country cannot make a great contribution there. Many make remarkable contributions, and they render great service as many of our missionaries do for short periods of time in foreign lands. But generally speaking, we do best in our own lands and cultures. There are many exceptions to this, but I’m speaking generally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Five</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What can we learn from faithful covenant people?</p>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson said recently&nbsp;that as saints of God, we make serious covenants unto the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>". . . Our covenants bind us to Him [the Savior]and give us godly power . . . Covenant-keeping men and women seek for ways to keep themselves unspotted from the world so there will be nothing blocking their access to the Savior’s power."<a href="#FN10" style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>As I have noted previously, the wonder of the faithful people of Ammon is that they were willing to die for their covenants; as were their warrior sons. They were given great power as they honored those covenants.</p>
<p>So, as President Nelson has admonished, we must keep ourselves unspotted from the world in order to have the power to battle against a hardened and cunning enemy who is constantly fighting against us. As covenant people, we have the power to become disciples of Jesus Christ and to have faith and love for Him even at the peril of our lives if necessary and to withstand any kind of enticement that Satan may throw at us?</p>
<p>You know what those enticements are! In a way, living in our time may be harder for us to keep our covenants than it was for the people of Ammon. Today facing the temptations of Satan may be much harder for us to keep our covenants in the same spirit and determination as the people of Ammon. You have bumped into these temptations: the temptation of not praying faithfully each day in a spirit of gratitude and love for Heavenly Father and His Son; the temptation of not being faithful in regularly reading scriptures, of not dressing modestly, of not always faithfully attending Church meetings, of not always strictly obeying the Honor Code of this school, of not always showing a sign as our prophet leaders have asked to show our commitment to honor the Sabbath Day. And probably the strongest temptation of them all is related to money—the powerful lure of money which seems to entice us to not return to our homelands. And there are many other temptations to get us to break our covenants which we have made with the Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To withstand these temptations, we need strong testimonies. Elder Neal A. Maxwell formed his testimony on three pillars of conversion: a witness of the Spirit pillar; an intellectual pillar; and an experiential pillar. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever you have come from, each of you should seek to do the same: have a witness of the spirit which positively brings into your heart the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Each of you should also build into your testimonies knowledge—even an intellectual dimension which enables you to explain with confidence your beliefs and allows you to measure all that you learn in the secular world against that sure knowledge of the Gospel; and of course, you should gain strength in your testimonies through experience in serving others. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Six</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, what does all this add up to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ve come here from many lands to get a good education. You are now able to fashion a career; you know much about the Gospel of Jesus Christ including its covenants, and you know much about responsible living; and you know much about the importance of hard work. When you reach the point of graduation, having learned all these wonderful things, you then return to your land and share what you have learned with your people. But there’s more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As covenant people, you are entitled, through inspiration and revelation to receive direction in your lives that will bring great hope and happiness to you and your loved ones. Visions will open to you as to how you can make a great contribution in your homelands. You will be able to walk through your lives with confidence knowing that you are fulfilling the dreams of those who love you, and even those who first settled the islands of the sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will go back to a place of safety where apostles and prophets have pronounced marvelous blessings upon your lands and claim those blessings. And who wouldn’t want the blessings spoken from the mouths of apostles and prophets? Or the blessings prayed for by faithful people from the Book of Mormon &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I began this speech, I told you of a Samoan proverb: <em>E lele le toloa, ae ma’au lona ua i le vai.</em>&nbsp;At one time you flew away from your homes and I suspect that you have kept alive a longing to return; I hope you have a chronic crink in your necks in that longing. Return and take with you a good education; prepare to serve your people and live to be honorable to your covenants made with the Lord and then be assured that you live under the protection of those covenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear solemn testimony and my witness that apostles and prophets represent the Lord; their apostolic blessings are sure and meaningful. I also testify that it is possible to keep all of our covenants. It takes great effort but we can be like the people of Ammon. I testify that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. And most importantly, I testify that our Savior Jesus Christ is closely involved in this great work in which we are engaged today; in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>President and Sister Tanner, President Council members, President Grace, Stake Presidents, faculty, staff and fellow students, I am humbled to have this opportunity to share my testimony with you this morning. &nbsp;My husband and I have the privilege of serving you on this campus. &nbsp;We have grown to love all that this school stands for. &nbsp;How we treasure our association with such outstanding students, and are grateful for the opportunity to learn from the wisdom and example of committed faculty and employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I feel of your spirit and the greatness of this school; it is uplifting and edifying. &nbsp;I sense my inadequacies as I stand before you, sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, under Whose direction I pray to address you today.</p>
<p>The entry under “Prayer” in the Bible Dictionary states:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. &nbsp;The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them. &nbsp;Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. &nbsp;Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to break down this meaning and demonstrate how the power of prayer has impacted my life and the testimony of Jesus Christ I hold so dearly in my heart.</p>
<p>"Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other."</p>
<p>As a child, I learned from my parents how to pray. &nbsp;My father was assigned as the Principal for the LDS Middle School in Latai, Nuku’alofa. &nbsp;My father wanted the family to move from Liahona in order to be closer to his job. &nbsp;To understand the difficulty of this task, you have to understand that land cannot be bought in Tonga. &nbsp;Land is passed down from father to son. Being a righteous man, my father knew that moving our family closer to his job was right and best thing for all of us. &nbsp;So, our family fasted and prayed fervently to ask Heavenly Father for his help in finding a place. &nbsp;Our morning &amp; evening prayers included our family’s plea to find a place. &nbsp; To aid in this endeavor, my father requested the help of other family members to keep a look out for a place for our family. &nbsp;A week later, my uncle told my father that a person named Katoa, was willing to gift him a piece of land in exchange for $300 pa’anga to help his family. &nbsp;At that time $300 pa’anga, was a lot of money, an equivalent of $150 US dollars. &nbsp;When my father met with this man, he found out that all of his sons were provided with lands, but the man had extra land. &nbsp;Depending on how much land or how many pieces of land you have, each male member, from oldest to youngest, will receive a piece of land. &nbsp;A meeting was arranged by the Acting Minister of the land to sign off the piece of land to my father. Katoa’s brother was also requested to attend this meeting, giving him the opportunity to dispute the gifting of the land to an “outsider” of the family. The dilemma was that although Katoa’s sons had lands, his brother had a son that did not have land. &nbsp;This meant that rightly so, the extra land should have been given to Katoa’s nephew. &nbsp;Our family prayers became more earnest, understanding the ordeal we were facing. &nbsp; If this was the Father’s will, we had faith that this almost impossible arrangement would work out. Friday morning, my father offered our family prayer and again, petitioned Heavenly Father’s help, if it was His will. &nbsp;My father and Katoa were at the office by 1:45 pm. &nbsp;2:00 pm came and Katoa’s brother was nowhere to be found. &nbsp;The Acting Minister said that they would wait 5 more minutes to give Katoa’s brother a chance. &nbsp;After 2:05 pm, the paper was signed and my father was legally given the land. During our family prayer that night, my father offered thanksgiving for blessing our family with the piece of land obtained. &nbsp;Our communion with our Father in Heaven that night was a sweet and powerful feeling that filled each of us with a strong testimony that what we had been praying and fasting for was indeed in correspondence with our Heavenly Father’s will and that He had provided a way for us to fulfill that will. &nbsp;Our home was later built and we moved in. &nbsp;Many, many years later, our home became the meeting house for the Nuku’alofa 2nd Ward when we lost our chapel due to the lease not being renewed. &nbsp;Our ward was assigned to the Havelu Chapel for our church meetings. &nbsp;Our home became the meeting place for ward choir practice, mutual for single adults, early morning seminary, full-time missionary’s district meetings and countless ward meetings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My father took to heart the Savior’s admonition given in 3 Nephi which says: “Pray in your families unto the Father, always, in my name that your wives and your children may be blessed.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup>&nbsp; I’m grateful for the wonderful examples of faithful parents, who throughout the course of their time here on earth, taught my siblings and I the importance of consistent and sincere communication with our Heavenly Father. &nbsp;The lessons I learned early on in my family setting, helped to shape how I personally accepted and confronted challenges later in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon graduating from high school, I had the opportunity to serve a full-time mission in my homeland of Tonga. &nbsp;The first area that I was assigned to was the island of Ha’afeva in Ha’apai, where I traveled by boat with my mother as my companion. &nbsp;My mother was given permission from the Mission President to accompany me in order to ask her mother, my grandmother, to allow the missionaries to live with her. &nbsp;You see, my grandmother was not a member of our faith however, she agreed to allow the missionaries to live with her under one condition: that the gospel not be preached in her home. &nbsp;She did tell my mother that the missionaries were required to join with her in morning and evening prayers. &nbsp;My companion, Sister Masiu, joined me on the island two days later. &nbsp;We happily agreed to my grandmother’s arrangement, and already saw opportunities to share the gospel with her “under her conditions.” We also resolved to leave some of our church pamphlets around the house, hoping that she would read them. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time that I was serving, there was maybe about 300 people living on the island and the only members were the Branch President and his family along with my companion and me, so you can imagine the amount of work we had ahead of us. Most of the people on the island were my family members and even though they provided us with meals, they refused to hear the message that we had to share of the restored gospel. &nbsp;We continued to pray and plead with the Lord for an opportunity to find a family that would not only be willing to let us in their home, but also be accepting of His message. &nbsp;Through acts of service, we were only able to answer the inquiries of those who received us. Because we were young and recently graduated from high school, many people associated our age with naiveté, which is why many rejected our invitations. &nbsp;After four months of serving with no one accepting our invitations to hear the message, we felt discouraged. Even though we prayed, fasted, obeyed missionary rules and worked diligently, we felt that we had yielded no fruit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 2, 1978 which was a fast Sunday, Sister Masiu and I decided to set a specific goal that we would fast and pray about. &nbsp;We asked the Lord to direct us to one person on the island who would be ready to hear the message of the gospel and accept the invitation to be baptized. &nbsp; That night as we evaluated our day and made plans for the week, Sister Masiu suggested that we each prepare scriptures to help us focus on our goal for the week. &nbsp;I turned to Alma 29:1-4:- &nbsp;</p>
<p>“O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God with a voice to shake the earth and cry repentance unto every people!</p>
<p>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</p>
<p>But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.</p>
<p>... I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire…”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Sister Masiu then shared her scripture from Alma 37:36-37:-</p>
<p>“Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and withersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</p>
<p>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if you do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>After sharing our scriptures and thoughts with each other, we had both felt the impression to act. &nbsp;We decided we would pray unto the Lord all night in a sincere petition for His help to achieve our goal of finding one adult to teach and commit to baptism. Throughout the night, we would pray together as a companionship and then individually. &nbsp;The most meaningful and sincere prayers we offered contained many expressions of thanks, asking forgiveness for our shortcomings and imperfections and petitions for assistance to improve the work in that area. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Monday morning came and although we had been up all night praying, we felt rejuvenated and ready to tackle our goals for the week. &nbsp;I felt armed, not only with the understanding that our answers, or assistance, may not arrive immediately, but also with the comfort and confirmation from the Holy Ghost that the Lord had heard our pleas and was aware of each of His children on that little island. &nbsp;As we were leaving the house that morning, my grandmother called us back to ask if we could help with the cooking and house chores because she was not feeling good. &nbsp;We gladly told her not to worry and made slight changes to our schedule for the day. &nbsp;Grandmother was sick that whole week, so we adjusted our schedule to accommodate the chores at home. &nbsp;Our week was successful in rendering service and finding joy while building the Kingdom, but we still hadn’t found someone who fully accepted the gospel and the invitation for baptism. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The following Monday, April 10th, as we were leaving the house for the day, grandmother called us back to the house. She wanted to speak to me in private, and had asked Sister Masiu to wait outside. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandmother looked at me seriously and my first thought was, “This is it! She will tell me her last wishes and I will have to relay them to her children.” But to my surprise, she whispered to me very quietly, as if there were someone in the room over hearing our conversation. &nbsp;She made me promise that I would not tell a soul of what she was about to share with me. &nbsp;I didn’t know what to expect at this point, so I made the promise as she proceeded to tell me of a dream she had.</p>
<p>She told me that she had this dream the previous Sunday and didn’t understand what it meant. &nbsp;It caused her to worry, which resulted in her being sick the whole week. &nbsp;In her dream, she said she was laying in her bed and a man came to her window calling her by name, “Sioana.” &nbsp;She said she looked at the man and didn’t recognize him, so she got out of bed and went to the window to find that the man calling her was her father, Sulivenusi Hafoka. &nbsp;He told her, “Come join the true church.” &nbsp;Grandmother couldn’t make sense of this and asked him, “What is the true church?” &nbsp;He answered, “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints”. &nbsp;Then he walked away. &nbsp;My grandmother followed him because she didn’t understand his response of “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints”, but wanted to know what this “true church” was. In her dream, she recalled that they arrived at a place that was not familiar to her. &nbsp;Her father stood on one side and her on the opposite side of the room. &nbsp;My grandmother said she saw a white cemented space, surrounded by pipes, with stairs leading into water. &nbsp;Her father told her once more, “Come, join the true church.” Grandmother said she asked him again, “What is the true church?” &nbsp;Her father answered, “The Mormon Church”, which is when she awoke from the dream. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While laying sick in bed, she wondered how her father knew that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the “true church”. &nbsp;He had been a minister in the Methodist Church and was very devoted to his faith. It didn’t make sense to her and she couldn’t understand the dream, in addition to that, she did not speak to others about it for fear that she would be mocked.</p>
<p>Tears of happiness rolled down my face while my grandmother recounted her dream. &nbsp;In my heart, I shouted for joy. &nbsp;I couldn’t help but think of the many prayers offered that night by our own families and many church members asking the Lord’s assistance for missionaries to find the honest in heart. I called my companion into the house and we knelt in prayer, giving thanks to the Lord for hearing and answering our pleas of assistance to further his work on the island. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My companion and I told grandmother of our goal, the plans we committed to carryout to achieve that goal, and the struggles that we had in the work. &nbsp;I told her that the place her father took her to in her dream was a baptismal font. &nbsp;We helped to answer questions she had about the church as well as questions she had about how her father had joined the Church even though he had already passed on. We shared the Plan of Salvation with her and our conversation turned from minutes to hours. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>That day, brothers and sisters, my testimony was strengthened and I knew that we were not alone in the isles of the sea. &nbsp;Heavenly Father had heard and answered our prayers reminding me of the promise given by the Savior in the books of Matthew and Mark:</p>
<p>“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened”.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>“What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My grandmother was 77 years old when she was baptized on June 11, 1978. I was able to serve on her island for ten months. &nbsp;After being baptized and confirmed a member of the church, she remained faithful in attending her church meetings and received her endowments in the Tonga Temple in 1982. &nbsp;Some of her children were sealed to her and their father on April 6, 1982 in the Oakland Temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Blessings require some WORK or EFFORT on our part before we can obtain them.” &nbsp;This experience required work and effort not only on our part as missionaries, but also my grandmother, our families at home who prayed for us and the members of the church who prayed on our behalf. &nbsp;We did not see blessings as an immediate result our efforts alone, but as the continuous and combined work or efforts of everyone involved in the work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayer requires work and effort before we can obtain them – but is also requires us to align our will to our Fathers. &nbsp;When we do so, anything that we ask will be granted. &nbsp;Nephi son of Helaman was an example of this. &nbsp;The Lord told him in Helaman 10: 5, “And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to My will.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>A few years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. &nbsp;The plan was to have surgery to remove the tumor, followed by 4 chemo sessions every three weeks and then radiation, five days a week for six weeks. Our children were ranging between the ages of 6 years to 15 years old. At our family home evening, my husband informed our children, that as a family, we would fast and pray before my surgery. &nbsp;At the beginning of our family fast, my husband offered a very simple prayer petitioning Heavenly Father’s help. &nbsp;As I listened to him, I felt the urgency of his petition. &nbsp; I knew that Heavenly Father was aware, and is still aware, of every cell in my body especially the ones that were cancerous. &nbsp;Believing in miracles and the power of the priesthood is important, but faith sufficient to accept the Father’s will was the most important factor in my surgery and recovery. &nbsp; I knew from this simple prayer, that Heavenly Father would give me the peace I sought and the courage I needed.</p>
<p>On the morning of my surgery, there were some procedures that needed to be done in preparation for my surgery. &nbsp;I was taken to the x-ray room where they injected a dye into the area where the tumor was so the doctor would have a clear view of it during the surgery. &nbsp;As I laid on the table with a machine hovering over my body, I glanced at what the technician was doing as she entered some information; after which, she left the room. &nbsp;I laid there and something told me to watch the monitor. &nbsp;When I observed what the monitor manifested, I could clearly see two tumors, one above the other. &nbsp;The technician came to check the monitor then left again. When I went back to the room to prepare for my surgery, I told my husband, who was waiting, “I saw two tumors”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The surgery was performed and it took a while for me to come to, and when I finally woke up, my husband was upset. &nbsp;He expressed his concern and confusion because I was still asleep after the doctor came to check on me several times. He asked the doctor if she had removed both tumors and the doctor reported that there was only “one.” He then explained to the doctor that I saw two tumors on the monitor. &nbsp;The doctor reassured him that there was only one and I was discharged that night. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Four days later the doctor called me at work to explain the nature of the tumor. &nbsp;She proceeded to tell me that there was “good news” and “bad news” and asked which I preferred to hear first – I asked for the “bad news.” She apologized and told me that she didn’t review my x-ray on the morning of my surgery but reviewed the x-ray two days later and saw that there was a second “tumor.” I included my husband in the phone call and he firmly expressed his feelings with my doctor. I requested time to consider my options for the next step I would be taking for my treatment. &nbsp;After much thought and prayer, I requested an immediate mastectomy. &nbsp;Could this mishap have been avoided? &nbsp;Absolutely. &nbsp;Should I have let my husband express the anger he felt towards the doctor for overlooking the x-rays from the morning of my surgery? Sure! I could have, but I count this “mishap” as a blessing in disguise. &nbsp;I did not want to burden my family members in asking them to be my drivers to and from the hospital for my radiation, 5 days a week for 6 weeks, not to mention the expense of gas and then food to feed my drivers. The mastectomy eliminated my radiation treatment and prepared me for the same procedure and treatment to be done on my other breast, where a tumor would be discovered six years later.</p>
<p>We don’t always know why the Lord gives us specific challenges, or why He doesn’t take them away when we pray sincerely and often, however, we can be assured that He is in control. &nbsp;I do not believe that my illness was a punishment from God. &nbsp;Instead, this became a time for me to learn to trust and depend on Him and His Son. &nbsp;Regardless of the outcome of this dreadful disease, I am grateful that Heavenly Father has seen fit to test me with these challenges that seem perfectly custom-tailored to try my faith, my capacity to endure, and to help me grow spiritually, as He does with you and all of your challenges. &nbsp;In retrospect, I’ve learned how much God truly loves me by inventorying the petitions He had refused to grant me. &nbsp;Perhaps our tests are yet another chance for us to seek after Him and to come to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ. &nbsp; The Lord promised, “Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, their troubles and their afflictions and shall be lifted up at the last day.”<a href="#FN8">8</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a testimony of the power of prayer. &nbsp;I have come to realize my absolute dependence on the Lord and have more fully felt His love and mercy. &nbsp;I testify that God knows our names and so much more. &nbsp;He knows the intent of our hearts, our righteous desires, and our every pain. &nbsp;“He will lead you by the hand and give you answers to your prayers.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;He loves us enough that He gave His Son as our Savior. &nbsp;By that gift He made it possible for us to gain immortality and eternal life. &nbsp;Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. &nbsp;The fullness of the gospel has been restored to the earth in this dispensation. &nbsp;In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.&nbsp;</p>

http://devotional.byuh.edu/media170516<br><title>After Much Tribulation, Come the Blessings | Devotional</title><br><p style="text-align: center;">Introduction</p>
<p>Brother and Sisters, Friends, and Fellow Students, Aloha! It is an honor to be with you this morning. This is the third time I have had this honor. To use a baseball metaphor, if I swing and miss again, I will indeed strike out today! That would mean that my name would permanently be removed from the university’s list of possible future devotional speakers! I’ll do my best!</p>
<p>My remarks are directed primarily to the students. I have pondered over what I might share with you this morning. First, let me say that many years ago Sharon and I walked the same path you are now on, here at BYU Hawaii. We lived in the coveted Temple View Apartments. Later, we served as dorm parents of Hale 5. During my tenure as a student, I worked at the Polynesian Cultural Center as a guide and later as a student supervisor and personnel clerk. Nearly thirty years ago, I marched in the December commencement, in this very building, and received a degree in business management--a miracle for me, my family, and everyone else who knew me as a youth. I am a grateful recipient of the abundant blessings that flow from this beautiful and sacred place, wherein is sited the Lord’s temple, the university and the cultural center. Second, I applaud your decision to be here, pursuing your education, developing your intellect and character, preparing for the future and following the counsel of the prophets.</p>
<p>I have thought about what comes next for you, after you leave BYU Hawaii and step out into the big wide world. That transition from the classroom to the street, from the theoretical to the real and actual, is a crucial process; an education of its own. The initial years following college can be sobering, turbulent, and rewarding. It is the phase of life where some of you begin building your family and career, acquiring experience, developing expertise, demonstrating your worth, paying your dues and laying down roots. Indeed, the first three to five years out of college may be daunting, and will be a foundation for the rest of your life. It is that critical time period I wish to focus on today.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of my talk includes, uncharacteristically, lengthy accounts of my own story, personal experiences from my “fresh out of college” formative years. I share my experiences only to 1) show that I started off the same way most college graduates do, poor and enthusiastic; and 2) to underscore the truth that the Lord will be with you during that exciting phase of your life, as he was with me. I have selected the following scripture as the basis for my remarks. It is especially applicable to the after-college timeframe. Said the Savior:</p>
<p>"For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</p>
<p>For after much tribulation come the blessings . . ."<a href="#FN1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, to my story, the length of which, by the way, could turn out to be the cause of your tribulation for the day. But I ask that you patiently endure, the blessing will come when I return to my seat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">First Business Venture</p>
<p>My first business venture (or adventure, as the case may be) occurred relatively soon after college. &nbsp;In late 1988, I began preparing for the GMAT by studying in the evenings. &nbsp;At the time, I planned to enroll in the MBA program at Chaminade University in Honolulu. &nbsp;During one of these late-night study sessions, I took a short break by switching on the television. &nbsp;I saw one of those “buy my program and make obscene amounts of money infomercials,” which admittedly, caught my attention. &nbsp;It had to do with buying government-seized goods and reselling them on the open market for a profit. &nbsp;The idea was intriguing. The U.S. Customs Department would seize illegal goods, often at their borders and ports, and then the General Services Administration would auction these items at a later sale. These sale auctions were frequently held in obscure locations and were not widely known. As a result, items would sell at a fraction of their market value. Later, I called a friend to discuss the idea of exploring starting up such a business and was surprised to learn that he and his brother, who had recently moved to the mainland, had already started evaluating the business. &nbsp;Within a month, we all felt good about pooling our resources to try our hand at the business. &nbsp;We were confident that we were going to “buy low and sell high” some government-seized article that would make us some “serious” cash. &nbsp;In the process, we resigned from our jobs, packed up and moved our little families to Idaho to meet up with my friend’s brother. &nbsp;We figured that among us we could muster $40k, our life savings, to make our first buy. &nbsp;We learned that private planes confiscated in drug raids had sold for $15-20k. &nbsp;We found out that the next U.S. government auction was to be held in Los Angeles. &nbsp;To save money, we drove 20 hours one-way from Boise, Idaho to attend our first auction. &nbsp;We had big plans. &nbsp;The 1984 Twin-Turbo Cessna jet, held in Peachtree, Georgia, was the last item on the auction block. &nbsp;We believed the market would fetch a healthy $250-$300k for this beautiful plane. The plane was decked out—diamond tucked leather interior with a full bar. We had it inspected in Peachtree by the father of a former Hale 5 resident assistant, who was an airplane mechanic with Delta. &nbsp;After a long day of watching the entire inventory get auctioned off, with a bidding sign in hand, we were pumped and ready to win the bid for this ex-drug cartel Turbo Cessna flying machine. &nbsp;When the auctioneer called for an opening bid of $200,000, our hearts nearly stopped, but there were no takers. &nbsp;He lowered the starting bid to $150,000. &nbsp;We held our breath for a second, but no takers. &nbsp;We thought he’d continue to lower the starting bid until he got down to a range where we could participate. &nbsp;The auctioneer then lowered the starting bid to $100,000 and someone raised their bid sign. &nbsp;We were stunned, devastated. The breath of life, our HA, left our bodies. &nbsp;When it was over, the winning bid was a whopping $198,000! &nbsp;Our plan, our dream . . . shattered! You can imagine the thoughts that rushed through our minds—“What happened? Where did we go wrong? What did we not know?” We thought we did our research. We were speechless. Incidentally, the winning bidder appeared to be a member of a drug cartel, and no one was going to outbid him! The 20-hour drive back to Idaho was twice as long. We returned deflated.</p>
<p>Prior to the Los Angeles auction, the government did not and could not use tax dollars to widely advertise these auctions. &nbsp;Consequently, as stated previously, these auctions were relatively unknown, and in most cases, held in inconspicuous locations. &nbsp;Accordingly, these seized items sold at pennies on the dollar. &nbsp;Unbeknownst to us, during our due diligence and relocation of our families to Idaho, the government entered into an agreement with Northrop, a large aerospace corporation, to have it handle and sell all its seized goods on consignment. &nbsp;Of course, Northrop, using its own dollars, began broadly advertising these auctions, and selected highly populated venues in which to hold them, to obtain the highest revenue possible. &nbsp;The first auction under this new arrangement was the 1989 Los Angeles auction that we attended. Talk about the importance of timing! &nbsp;Upon our arrival at the auction, we wondered why there were a thousand people there. &nbsp;Needless to say, our partnership ended as quickly as it started, and we went our separate ways. &nbsp;The good news? We each retained our portion of the $40k, and more importantly, kept our friendship intact.</p>
<p>Why share a story of failure? Because failure can be such a powerful teacher, if we learn from it. Lessons I learned? Don’t watch late-night “infomercials;” avoid get rich quick schemes; conduct more due diligence; things can change quickly in business, such as the Northrup consignment contract. Over time, the more important lesson I’ve learned from my entrepreneurial blunder is that sometimes the Lord keeps us from greater tribulation that would destroy us by allowing us to suffer lesser tribulation that we are able to bear. &nbsp;Elder George Q. Cannon taught:</p>
<p>“. . . the Saints should always remember that God sees not as man sees; that he does not willingly afflict his children, and that if he requires them to endure present privation and trial, it is that they may escape greater tribulations which would otherwise inevitably overtake them. If He deprives them of any present blessing, it is that he may bestow upon them greater and more glorious ones by and by.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Today, I realize that we had no plan beyond winning the bid for that beautiful plane. &nbsp;Had we won the bid and spent our life savings of $40k, we would have had no money to get to Georgia. How would we take possession of the plane? Where were we going to keep it while searching for a buyer? How much would that have cost? How would we find a buyer? Who would draft the sales contract? What are the laws that govern such a transaction? What about insurance, warranties, indemnifications, licenses, fees, taxes, regulatory requirements? All minor details, really. I behold now, with my natural eyes, that it was a huge blessing that we did not win that bid. It would have been a catastrophe otherwise. Over time, what was first humiliating is now humorous!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is like that. We experience setbacks, tribulation, even suffering, and wonder, “Where is God? Why is He not helping?” But over time, if we stay the course, He will help us see His design for us and incrementally, we will come to realize that He has brought us through the storms and has protected us from life’s greater trials to which we would have succumb. This protection is yet another great manifestation of the Savior’s undying love for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Stock Broker Opportunity</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Back to my story, the trials continued. &nbsp;In 1989, before leaving my friends in Idaho, I interviewed for stockbroker position with a certain Mr. Sebel, a manager in the Beverly Hills Division of the then prestigious investment banking firm, Drexel, Burnham and Lambert. &nbsp;Mr. Sebel was handling investments for the Church, but was looking for a young Mormon who could service and expand their LDS clientele. &nbsp;I flew to L.A., drove to Beverly Hills, and had a fantastic interview. &nbsp;Mr. Sebel all but said that I would be hired. &nbsp;He explained that the firm would put me and my family up on Wall Street for a year of training, and then we would return and I would work in the Beverly Hills office. &nbsp;He promised to call me within two weeks to confirm the plan. We began preparing mentally and emotionally for a move to the Big Apple. This was exciting stuff! &nbsp;The call came in two weeks, but not with the news we anticipated. &nbsp;Mr. Sebel explained that there was “internal restructuring” at the firm and that he didn’t know how long it would be before the dust settled, but that he would call me as soon as it did. Another blow. We were down again.</p>
<p>I tried to remain hopeful about the stockbroker prospect, but in the meantime, through other contacts, I moved our family to Provo, Utah and started writing loans as an independent contractor for a mortgage broker. &nbsp;I learned a lot from that experience. &nbsp;I could not believe the amount of paperwork involved in writing and closing a real estate loan. &nbsp;Each form in that packet was necessary to satisfy some law. Unfortunately, high interest rates hampered new loan applications, which made it difficult to survive on that meager income. &nbsp;Our savings continued to dwindle as my concern about caring for my little family intensified.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Six weeks following my interview with Mr. Sebel, while watching the news one evening, it was reported that the firm Drexel, Burnham and Lambert had been involved in a massive scandal that included insider trading, stock manipulation and fraud, among other things. &nbsp;Arrests and indictments were made and the firm eventually ended in bankruptcy. Mike Milken, the principal perpetrator, went to prison. Hollywood even made a movie about this scandal. It was called “Wall Street.” The stockbroker prospect disintegrated, and my discouragement was turning into desperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Refiner’s Fire</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I continued to look for work in Provo, but without success. &nbsp;By this time, our steadily diminishing funds were nearly depleted and my stress level soared. I was doing everything I could to find a job. The situation was dire. I thought the Lord had abandoned us. In the midst of this trial, I remember one particular night feeling that I my faith was failing. That night my prayer extended into the wee hours of the morning. Most pleadings were filled with anger, as I recited the good things I had done to justify receiving the help I wanted. I murmured, “I have served a mission for you, married and worked in the temple, served in various callings, even taught early morning seminary! How can you not help us?” I traversed the five stages of the life and death cycle: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. At the end of the prayer, as frustrated as I was, I knew that I could not, that I would not deny that the Lord was there, that He was aware of our plight and that He loved us. At that point, I finally let go of my pride, my anger, became submissive, relinquished all control to the Lord, and accepted without reservation whatever was to come from our situation, including homelessness, if it was the Lord’s will. I put my head down that night on a pillow that was soaked with my tears. This was a spiritual process, brought about by tribulation and suffering, and it changed me forever. I have not been able to find the words that begin to describe the transformational light, power and love that entered my heart and soul. Elder James E. Faust relates:</p>
<p>“In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner’s fire, and the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. … “This change comes about through a refining process which often seems cruel and hard. In this way the soul can become like soft clay in the hands of the Master in building lives of faith, usefulness, beauty, and strength.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>The next morning when I awoke, I felt a complete calm cover me. &nbsp;As I planned another day of job hunting, (at the risk of sounding melodramatic), I thought, “I should spend a little time driving around town to find a good viaduct to live under, just in case it comes to that point.” &nbsp;Then “out of the blue” at 8:25 that morning, I received a call from a friend who was a co-owner and vice president at Nu Skin, then a relatively young start up multi-level company. &nbsp;He inquired whether I would be interested in working there and said that he had been waiting for a middle management position to open up before calling me. &nbsp;I interviewed that morning with his brother, the CEO. &nbsp;Within in a few minutes, he offered me the job. &nbsp;I started immediately. &nbsp;That was on a Wednesday. &nbsp;Oddly, they paid me for three days at the end of that week. &nbsp;That amount, plus the remaining $65 in our bank account, was just enough to pay the next mortgage payment and buy groceries to hold us over until the next pay day. &nbsp;Since then, our family has never been without. I came to better understand that the Lord was in total control and that he could change my circumstances in a matter of seconds, as He did with one very timely phone call from a friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the World Ye Shall Have Tribulation</p>
<p>The Savior said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (John 16.33) Tribulation often stems from our own doing, such as when we sin or transgress, from inexperience or ignorance. People can also be the cause of our trials. Some adversity may result from simply being alive, such as aging, accidents and natural disasters. And then there are the customized trials, designed by the Lord, to enable us to become more Christlike. &nbsp;Sometimes when trials come, angels minister to us, as explained by President Harold B. Lee:</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid of the testing and trials of life. Sometimes when you are going through the most severe tests, you will be nearer to God than you have any idea, for like the experience of the Master himself in the temptation on the mount, in the Garden of Gethsemane, and on the cross at Calvary, the scriptures record, ‘And, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.’<a href="#FN4"><sup>4</sup></a> Sometimes that may happen to you in the midst of your trials.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the Lord allows us to have trials and tribulations, but they all sum up to one purpose: to help us progress toward perfection. I love the way C.S. Lewis likens the process of building a house to that of building a man:</p>
<p>“‘Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of—throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. …’<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>”<a href="#FN7"><sup>7</sup></a>“</p>
<p>Further, as the owner and general contractor in this process, the Lord makes these improvements according to our readiness and his time table. And it appears that he can speed up the perfection process. President Brigham Young said that Joseph Smith progressed toward perfection more in thirty-eight years because of his trials than he would have been able to do in a thousand years without them.<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Blessings Have Come</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>While at Nu Skin I worked with several attorneys. &nbsp;There I came to learn from and appreciate the analytical skills of lawyers. &nbsp;I also came to realize that much of my experience prior to this time taught me the importance of understanding that every aspect of business, and of life, is governed by law, and that I would do well to know the law. &nbsp;Nu Skin was a great company and while future opportunities there were very bright, I felt strong promptings to continue my education and to study the law. In time, I prepared for and attended law school. After graduating, we returned home. I sat for the bar, and while waiting for the results, HRI asked me to do some project work for them. Upon passing the bar, I had a few offers to work in Honolulu, but HRI also made me an offer. I was living with my in-laws on Iosepa Street and could not pass up the two-minute walking commute to work. I’m now in my twenty-third year there, five as an attorney, the rest in management.</p>
<p>Looking back, I can see the Lord’s guiding hand in my life, per his design, leading me from one experience to another and preparing me to return home, where my most important goals could be realized. &nbsp;For me, success meant that my wife could be a stay-at-home mom; that I could spend ample time with my children, teach them the gospel, create happy and positive memories together and have them grow up knowing their grandparents and extended family; that I could engage in meaningful work, support my children on missions and through college and see them marry in the temple, that I could serve the Lord in any calling he extended and make a contribution to the community; that I could build my own home in a place we love and be debt free; and that I could serve a mission with my wife. Nearly all these blessings, and more, have come. Sharon and I now enjoy two beautiful, very lively granddaughters. Truly, our “cup runneth over.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Closing</p>
<p>When you graduate, I suspect that some of you will be a little nervous about what the future holds for you. &nbsp;You may wonder how you’ll survive, where you’ll live, what you’ll do for a living, and so on. Muddling through that process is inescapable, but so very worth it. &nbsp;The Lord knows you, loves you and wants to bless you. Trust Him, come what may. Be humble and the Lord thy God will lead thee by the hand. &nbsp;Trust the Lord’s promise that if you turn to Him in humility and faith, He will turn your weaknesses into strengths.<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup> Pray as though everything depends on Him. &nbsp;Then work as though everything depends on you. &nbsp;You will be amazed at what He will make of you and your life. &nbsp;He will be in the details of your life, if you let Him. I’ve shared in part what the Lord did for me during those seminal years after college. My greatest lesson in all of this was to learn to willingly submit my will to the Lord’s--the one thing that we uniquely own, and the one thing the Lord requires from us, if are to be perfected. I have no doubt that the Lord will do what’s best for you when that marvelous time come in your life. I testify that the Savior’s promise is true—after much tribulation come the blessings . . .</p>
<p>I close with a quote from our dear Prophet, President Monson, who has given us this mighty assurance: “Fear not, be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> May the Lord bless you in all your righteous pursuits, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[Sister Bekker]</p>
<p>I would like to talk to you today about never giving up no matter what the odds….to consider thinking “outside of the box” to solve problems, not just think in the more traditional way to overcome difficulties. Sometimes, we have to dig deep within ourselves to find solutions, and at those times the Lord can put inspired thoughts into our minds in answer to prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never was the answer to a problem more “outside of the box” than when Joshua led the charge to bring down the walls of Jericho, or when Moses led the children of Israel to safety by parting the Red Sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt, they fled into the desert being chased by the Egyptian soldiers. When they arrived at the Red Sea, they were trapped. Many of them murmured that they had been lead out of captivity only to be trapped and killed. Their backs were certainly up against a wall. But God had a plan, and the sea was parted and they passed on dry ground. More than one of the Israelites probably thought, “I didn’t see that coming!” God’s solution was beyond the expectation of mortal men, and miraculous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Israelites arrived in Caanan, they desired to get into the walled city of Jericho. Did Joshua, their leader, have them attack and fight to gain entry as was the custom of the time? No. Joshua had them march around the city each day for seven days, and then on the seventh day, he had them march around the city seven times. As they circled the city, Joshua had them blow trumpets of ram’s horns and shout and yell. This was an unconventional approach to be sure! But, as we know, the walls of Jericho came tumbling down!<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> Miraculous and amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, solutions to our challenges may not be as dramatic as those examples, but in just the same way, we can be led to solutions that are creative and productive, miraculous and amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless we are exposed to life’s challenges we would never know ourselves of our own powers, or of our weaknesses. We would also not discover how the power of God can be manifest in our lives, and how we can grow and develop. After all, isn’t the entire purpose we are here on earth to become like our Father in Heaven as we go through refining experiences?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alma 12:24 we read:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“this life is a time to prepare to meet God...”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>And in verse 25 it says:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“but there was a plan...”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We know that there is a plan. We need to plan for the plan!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to explain to you the term “fix bayonets.” The term comes from an encounter in the Civil War. First, let me explain what a bayonet is.</p>
<p>A bayonet is a blade, adapted to fit the end of a rifle and used as a weapon in close combat. It is usually a weapon of last resort. The bayonet can be used by holding it in your hand, or it can be used when fastened to a rifle. When soldiers are told to fasten the bayonet to their rifle, the command is given to “fix bayonets.”</p>
<p>Now for the story. The Civil War began in the spring of 1861. By July of 1863, most of the major battles had been won by the South. General Robert E. Lee of the South felt that if he could take the war to the North and win another major battle, public opinion for the war would evaporate and the North would seek peace through surrender or compromise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This major battle occurred in a small town in southeastern Pennsylvania called Gettysburg. Many major historians feel that if the North would have lost the battle, there would have been great pressure for the war to end and we would have had an America that was separated into North and South. Lincoln knew that the people of the North needed a major victory or support for the war would begin to fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Major Joshua Chamberlain commanded the 20th Maine volunteer regiment and was given the assignment to protect the flank of the Union line. The flank meant the side. They were to prevent the Confederates from going behind the Union lines and attacking from the rear. Had this happened, it would have been very bad for the North. Major Chamberlain was told to protect the flank at all cost. He had 386 men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Alabama regiment from the South had attacked the Maine regiment twice. Both sides suffered great losses. However, Major Chamberlain knew that his men were out of ammunition and could not withstand another attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would you do if you knew you were out of ammunition and were sure to lose in the next encounter? Major Chamberlain shouted the command to “fix bayonets!” He then commanded his men to run downhill and charge the enemy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine how those men felt? Their hearts must have been pounding as they ran down the hill!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charging Maine regiment caught the Confederates off guard as they were not expecting an attack and they were able to capture many of the members of the Alabama regiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Major Chamberlain’s charge saved the day, and many feel it saved the Union. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor; the highest military honor given for his quick thinking and bravery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use this story to illustrate how we must never give up, no matter what the odds, and to seek heavenly guidance to be creative in our solutions to problems and challenges placed in our life. Challenges and problems given to us wisely to help us grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same way that those soldiers fixed their bayonets when their backs were against a wall, we must fix our figurative bayonets. We may not realize it, but we are at war with the temptations and distractions of Satan. It is a dangerous war because we may not realize our backs are against the wall until late in the battle, when solutions are limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these interesting times, we have trusted leaders, just like the Maine regiment had Major Chamberlain. We have prophets to guide us today; as we listen to their words we can “fix our bayonets” and be ready to charge forward toward success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does that look like today? Here are some ideas:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Read the Book of Mormon every day, as we were reminded In the recent General Conference, by our prophet Thomas S. Monson.<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> This brings great power and inspiration in our lives. I know because I have experienced this blessing in my life. I can testify to you that this book gives a power of protection and testimony to all who read it in earnest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Along with that, making sure there is more of your time devoted to spiritual development than to social media. Are you talking to your Father in Heaven in prayer each day anywhere near how much you text your friends? Don’t leave Him out of your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Speaking of social media, you can fix filters on your phones and computers to prevent the possibility of seeing material offensive to the spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Doing temple work amidst a full schedule at school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Reading our scriptures and saying our prayers BEFORE doing our homework each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Standing alone in the face of social pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In thinking of the pressures of society today on you to conform, I am reminded of the young boy-prophet Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith, after the first vision received a large amount of ridicule from former friends in the community, even pastors. I am sure that was very difficult, but he was fixed in his determination and resolve. In his own words he recorded:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why persecute me for telling the truth? I had actually seen a vision and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I have seen a vision, I knew it and I knew that God knew it and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it...”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Did young Joseph trust God more than he trusted men?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we think back to that battle at Gettysburg, what went into that moment for those men that had no ammunition left? Were they blindly trusting their leader, or do you think he had earned their trust?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we trusting the Lord? The Savior Jesus Christ indeed gave everything he had for us, and He most certainly deserves our trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants Section 19 verse 16 we read:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>When the Savior entered the Garden of Gethsemane, he had no worldly ammunition. In essence, He fixed His bayonet, fought the battle and won the war for each one of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we fix our bayonets by doing those things each day that will make all the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Reading the Book of Mormon every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Devote more time to spiritual development through prayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Eliminate material that would be offensive to the spirit in any way from your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Go to the temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Scriptures and prayer before homework every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Stand up, even if you must stand alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we “fix our bayonets” by doing those things each day that will make all the difference. As we do so, we will call down the powers of Heaven. The power that was generated by the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ, for us to emerge victorious from the challenges of this day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that the Savior lives. As we charge forward, though our hearts may be pounding, we know in whom we trust, and we cannot fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[President Bekker]</p>
<p>My dear Brothers and Sisters, what a unique privilege this is to be with you for a few minutes today and share some impressions I have had as I have prayed, fasted and pondered this invitation to speak to you. I pray that you will listen to the promptings of the spirit that will come to you as we spend this time together- those promptings will be significant, and are meant for you personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, you are amazing! As I have visited with many of you at Stake Conferences and around campus, I am so impressed with who you are. I am just a bit jealous…you are at an amazing time of your life, and for a moment, I think, “I would love to be in college again.” Then I think of the tests and the papers and organic chemistry, and I reconsider! I am grateful for where I am now!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You though, have the future ahead of you, and what decisions you make today will shape the outcomes of your tomorrows. “Now” is very important for you. Because it is so important, I want to talk about some of those decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to introduce my thoughts today by sharing a story that happened in our family a few years ago. For a long time, I could not even talk about it. However, there are some valuable parallel lessons to be learned from this experience, and so I will share it with you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our family, we had the “kid’s car.” It was a sporty red SUV that was dependable and safe in the snow and the hills around our house. As each child went away to college or on a mission, the car stayed home for the next child to drive, and there were times when the car was shared by more than one child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One spring day, it was determined that the tires on the car were quite bald, and we needed new ones. One of our daughters, Elizabeth, had the task of taking it in to get the new tires. That day was a stormy spring day, and the rain was really coming down in buckets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elizabeth headed out to the tire store, and got onto the freeway. A few minutes later, she hit a puddle of standing water that caused the bald tires to lose their grip on the road and the car did a little spin and bumped into the guardrail on the side of the road. The fender was dented, but she was ok- just a little shaken up. The car was still drivable, and she started up and headed down the road, continuing on to the tire store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the dented fender and needing some reassurance, she called me on her cell phone. She told me what had happened and that she was sorry for the dent. I made sure she was ok, and then we continued talking for a few minutes as she continued driving down the freeway. (Now, I know you are all thinking that you shouldn’t be talking on a cell phone while driving- and you are exactly right!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>After going a few miles, and while we were still talking, she came to another larger puddle of water. Even though she was going very slow, the car started to hydroplane. As I was talking to her, her voice changed. I could hear the anxiousness build in her voice… “Dad, Dad, Dad, I’m sliding…the car is starting to spin…Dad, DAD…I’m spinning around…………"</p>
<p>And then it happened. I heard her yell, as the car spun completely around and then hit the part of the road where the water stopped. Because she was going sideways at that point, the tires skidded on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>pavement. Amidst her screams, a horrific, loud, crashing, crunching sound came over the phone as the car flipped and rolled. It seemed like it lasted forever, and then there was silence. Every parent’s nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was frantic, calling into the phone, “…Liz, Liz, are you ok.” For a long while I heard nothing, and feared the worst. Then, I heard a weak voice say, “…I, I think I’m ok.” Soon I heard knocking and pounding on the car as people came to help her and were trying to get her out of the mangled wreckage. I handed the phone to Sister Bekker and I raced to my car to go to where the wreck had occurred. When I finally got there, our Elizabeth was being helped by kind people who had witnessed the crash, and luckily she was not hurt. The fun red kid’s SUV was a complete loss, but it had proven to be a cocoon of safety for her as it rolled, and we know she was protected by heavenly angels that day as well. She is now the beautiful mother of three adorable boys, and her kind husband always keeps good tires on her car!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do I tell you this story? The reason is simple. Tread on tires can be related to “spiritual tread” in our lives. You cannot go out of the house today without your spiritual tread being thick and deep. Unfortunately, all too often, we are running our lives on bald spiritual tires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at some pictures of tire tread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to see from this picture which tire will have a better grip on the road. Spiritual tread is just as important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spiritual tread is made up of essential, life-saving daily habits. Many of us claim that we know this, but too many head out being a little “thin” in the tread department. Some would say, “I’m ok. I still believe, I just don’t do everything all the time. That attitude is dangerously like a thin treaded tire, deceptively unsafe for the road of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are taught in the Doctrine and Covenants to establish our house…. very similar to putting spiritual tread on our tires. In Section 109 verse 8 we are advised:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God…”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>How do we establish our own house of God? How do we put “spiritual tread” on our tires?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spiritual tread is made up of some basic elements that we incorporate into our lives each day. Sister Bekker has just referred to some of them. I will add a few thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One row of tread can be likened to prayer. When we kneel down each day and ask our Father in Heaven to be our companion, to guide us and help us to make decisions, the day will always turn out better. Daily, sincere talking with our Father in Heaven adds a row of deep gripping tread to our spiritual tire. Following the spiritual promptings we receive from prayer keeps us on the right road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another row of tread can be added to our tires when we study the scriptures. Notice, I didn’t say “read” the scriptures……that is just going through the motions. If you are studying for a test, you don’t just read the words- you digest them, you remember them, committing them to memory, and they become knowledge for you. Study of the scriptures is most effective when it happens in the same way. We learn and live what we study, and we study what we need to know to live. The scriptures are our most important textbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service in the church, community and in our families is another row of spiritual tread. Always have a calling- don’t wait for the Bishop or his representative to come to you…..you approach them and ask for an official opportunity to serve. Remember that home teaching and visiting teaching are Heavenly Father’s plan for his children to minister to each other. Take this seriously. The Savior has never been more quoted than when He said: “Love one another, as I have loved you.”<a href="#FN8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Attending the temple is an excellent way to build spiritual tread. As you are attending this wonderful university, remember to spend some time in the Lord’s university…..the temple. There you will receive inspired principles of eternity, and you will receive personal revelation that will guide your life. Going often, even every week, can open your mind to tremendous spiritual learning. That equates to more tread on your spiritual tire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main treads on your spiritual tire is appropriate Sabbath Day Observance. I personally think this area is where the stalwart are separated from the fence-sitters in the gospel. This commandment is hard in today’s hectic world, with our hectic schedules. There is such a temptation to use Sunday to catch up on all that we didn’t get done during the week, or use the day for recreation instead of devoting that special time to the Lord’s work. Make no mistake though, when you give one day each week to renewing covenants and spiritual pursuits, you are promised that the other six days of the week will be much more productive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We add some of the most necessary tread to our tires when we keep the commandments……exactly! The power over the adversary’s distractions is strong when we keep commandments; when we don’t keep commandments, the adversary has an open invitation to influence our thoughts and actions. The Word of Wisdom, the Law of Chastity and paying a full Tithing are on this list. You know what they are- is your tread in these areas thick, or are you wearing a little thin in places? The spirit will tell you where you need to improve…. maybe even right now you are being prompted of something to adjust in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, consider one of the most important treads on our tire. Sharing the Gospel. You didn’t think I was going to talk today without mentioning missionary work, did you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been commanded to open our mouths, and to preach the gospel at all times and in all places. We are all missionaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 24:12 it says:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And at all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and declare my gospel as with the voice of a trump, both day and night.” (Then there is this great promise….) “And I will give unto him strength such as not known among men.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>That is spiritual strength, that is tread on your spiritual tires. That is “extra grip” tread that we gain as we share the gospel. The strength “not known among men” is the power to overcome sin, to prevail against the adversary, to know God’s will and have the determination to follow that will in our lives. This leads ultimately to happiness. Life is so much more enjoyable when we are safely on the road that takes us back to our Father in Heaven. Life is meaningful as we invite others to learn about the Savior and experience the joy of the gospel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, our daughter had a warning experience that told her that the tires were dangerous BEFORE the big crash took place- the little bump into the guardrail. Just like that, we will always have a warning experience before we have a spiritual crash. The Holy Ghost will prompt you with a warning to change your course and go in a different direction. You will be guided to look ahead, whether it be in a personal pursuit or in a relationship. As you look ahead, you will be able to identify combinations that will lead to trouble, and avoid them. Heed those warnings- they are priceless promptings from a loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine our Father in Heaven, who loves you perfectly, watching you on earth. No cell phone needed- He sees everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now imagine when you are in a place where you feel your life “spinning out of control” and you call out…” Father, Father, I am spinning, I’m spinning, I’m going to crash.” I bear witness that He will come to where you are and give you comfort and help. When your spiritual tread is thin, He will help you put on new spiritual tires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beauty of this arrangement, is that even if you are not “spinning out of control” you can call out to your Father in Heaven and He will come to where you are and give you comfort and help. He has given His Only Begotten Son to atone for sins, and insure that we can have new tires put on our spiritual car. It does not matter what bumps you have experienced on the road of life; we can overcome all things through the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many missionaries talk to me as they are returning home, and express worry that they will fall back into old habits, or become less active in the church because of the distractions of the world. I promise them that if they will remember these simple truths, they will not lose the fire of the gospel in their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scripture Study&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service in the Church&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regular Temple Attendance&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sabbath Day Observance&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exact obedience to commandments of the Law of Chastity, Word of Wisdom and paying a full tithing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening your mouth at all times and in all places to share the gospel. Remember, you are amazing. Your Father in Heaven loves you, and is watching over you on this journey. Look at the tread on your spiritual tires, and get some new tread where necessary. I bear my testimony that a loving Heavenly Father is always watching, and a loving Savior has provided the new spiritual tires that we all periodically need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the Savior lives. I have received a witness of Him, and I have felt His influence in my life. May we all choose to follow Him on this road of life, I pray, In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aloha! I express my gratitude to President John Tanner and the BYU-Hawaii administration for the invitation to address you at this devotional. I have made many trips to this campus and have also had the blessing of teaching here for three summers and I love BYU-Hawaii and the Laie community. It is fitting that Laie’s own Auntie Kela Miller would introduce me today as she is the person who kindly arranged for me to meet Sister Ku’ulei Bell during my first visit to Kalaupapa, a unique settlement on the Hawaiian island of Moloka‘i. Here, commencing in 1866, patients, afflicted with leprosy were forced to separate from society; yet, working together, they forged a loving, united community transforming their space into sacred ground.</p>
<p>I felt the lure of Kalaupapa before I ever visited there. In 2003, my wife, Joanna, and I were investigating the Hawaiian Islands in preparation for a research trip and anniversary celebration. I asked her where she would like to visit after my research was completed and she quickly responded, “I don’t care where else we go, but we must see Kalaupapa.” It was high adventure just getting to that remote location. The destination necessitated a precarious mule ride down the highest sea cliffs in the world.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> At last, we spilled out onto a flat peninsula, four-miles of transforming terra firma that changed my life.</p>
<p>The literal translation of Kalaupapa has been rendered “flat plain” or “flat leaf.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> In either case, I discovered through much reading, many interviews, and multiple firsthand encounters that Kalaupapa is a leveling experience: Here one crosses the boundaries of his or her self-proclaimed beliefs and ethnicity and melds into a community defined only by humanity, a greater realm of brotherhood and compassion. For it is in Kalaupapa where religious denominations and cultural divides vanish—where the love of God and mankind manifest themselves in a truly magnificent way, triumphing over the devastation of leprosy also known as the separating sickness.</p>
<p>Thousands of people worldwide are currently infected with this disease, which affects primarily the skin and nerves. However, less than five percent of the human population is susceptible to its ravishes. In 1873, a Norwegian physician named Dr. Gerhardt Hansen discovered the cause of the sickness, a bacillus, mycobacterium leprae, and as a result, years later, the illness began to be referred to as “Hansen’s disease.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the same year, Dr. Hansen made his medical discovery, two ecclesiastical leaders from different faiths first made their appearance on the Kalaupapa peninsula. One was a Latter-day Saint named Jonathan Hawaii Napela, the other a Belgian priest, Father Damien J. De Veuster, who was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in 2009. Napela was born on the island of Maui in 1813, became a district judge in 1848, and converted to Mormonism in 1852. He was a tremendous aid to early LDS missionary work on the Hawaiian Islands as he fed and housed the elders, helped them learn his native language, and aided George Q. Cannon with the translation of the Book of Mormon. Perhaps his greatest contribution was his example as a loving husband. When his beloved wife Kitty contracted the disease, Jonathan chose to remain with her in the settlement and act as her kokua, a Hawaiian word meaning “helper.” Consequently, Jonathan wrote a heart-felt letter in his native language, Hawaiian, to the Board of Health, pleading that he might be allowed to stay with his wife:</p>
<p>"On August 3, 1843 I took my wife as my legally married wife and on that same day I vowed before God to care for my wife in health and sickness, and until death do us part…. I am 60 years old and do not have much longer to live. During the brief time remaining, I want to be with my wife. My wife has also lived a long life, but with this disease, it will quickly shorten her life. Such is the reason for this petition."<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Fortunately, Jonathan’s request was granted, and he spent the remaining years of his life at Kalaupapa with Kitty. While there, Napela more than just his wife. Not long after his arrival, he was called as the leader of the LDS Church on the Kalaupapa peninsula, a calling he held from 1873 until his death in 1879, from the effects of Hansen’s disease.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, Father Damien arrived at Kalaupapa about the same time the Napelas did. This Belgian priest would eventually gain international fame because of his demonstration of faith and attitude of selfless service on the island best, captured by his own words: “Suppose the disease does get my body, God will give me another one on Resurrection Day.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup> From the day of his arrival in 1873 until his death in 1889 at age forty-nine, his concern was for all the patients, regardless of race or religion. He especially loved the orphaned children whom he often led in singing. His Christian service on the Kalaupapa peninsula serves as an important reminder of Elder Orson F. Whitney’s words, offered in a 1921 general conference address: “God has been using not merely his covenant people, but other peoples of the world as well, to carry out a work that is too demanding for the limited numbers of Latter-day Saints to accomplish by themselves. Other good and great men and women have been inspired of God under many circumstances to deliver dimensions of light and truth.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Soon after their arrival at the settlement, Jonathan Napela and Father Damien became acquainted. Both had come to Kalaupapa to serve, and both contracted Hansen’s disease as a result of their charity. Damien was twenty-seven years younger than Napela, and the cultural background of each was very different, yet both were firmly committed to their religious orientations. Though ecclesiastical leaders of different faiths, they became dear friends. In fact, one of their contemporaries who lived at Kalaupapa wrote, “After Father Damien arrived in the Leper Settlement, ...Mr. J. Napela and...Father Damien were the best of friends.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>In early 2005, I learned that both BYU-Hawaii and Chaminade, a Catholic university in Honolulu, were celebrating their jubilee anniversaries. I approached the presidents of both schools (BYU-H President Eric B. Shumway and Chaminade President Sue Wesselkamper) about the idea of a joint celebration on each campus and explained that it seemed natural to share this wonderful interfaith story, which seemed to have commenced with the friendship between Damien and Napela. They listened attentively and agreed to it and lectures were held on both campuses.</p>
<p>Between 1866 and 1969, many other lifetime friendships were forged among the eight thousand plus people who were forcibly relegated to the Kalaupapa peninsula. Thankfully, by 1969 sulfone drugs were developed and administered, arresting the disease and patients were again free to move abroad as they wished. In this same year when Neil Armstrong took a giant step onto the moon, the Hawaii Board of Health finally made the move to permanently end the isolation of all patients.<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> In spite of this significant decision which lifted the ban, many patients chose not to leave. Others left Kalaupapa and tried to assimilate into society, but found life was better in the settlement and returned “home.” This was a time of realization and reflection for the patients. Each discovered, in their own time, that they had fashioned a paradise out of a hell.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Kalaupapa community had been sanctified through suffering. One former patient, Bernard Punikai‘a, said that Kalaupapa used to be viewed as “a devil’s island, a gateway to hell, worse than a prison.” But he added, “Today it is a gateway to heaven. There is a spirituality to the place. All the suffering of those whose blood has touched the land—the effect is so powerful even the rain cannot wash it away.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Jack Sing, Kalaupapa’s branch president for three decades (1952-1983), and recipient of BYU Hawaii’s distinguished service award (1978), observed, “In Honolulu everybody for themselves—you have money you have friends, you have no money, you have no friends. Over here, ...money no matter.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> Referring to the outside world of Honolulu and beyond, another patient, Makia Malo observed, “They thought it [Kalaupapa] was hell and we thought it was heaven.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Reflecting back over her years spent at Kalaupapa, one Protestant patient, Nancy Talino, told her experience of coming to have an intimate relationship with God:</p>
<p>"We were nurtured. ...Not just by a Protestant or a Mormon or even Catholic nuns. Everyone worked together. ...Everyone needed prayers, there were prayers. And I was thankful that I was very close, very close to God. ...Someone asked, 'Do you ask God why?' I said, 'No, I don’t.' I just say, 'Maybe it’s a wake-up call.' I thank Him. ...I want people to know, really know the love in the hearts of the people of Kalaupapa. ...We’ve got hearts. We’ve got hearts."<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>In another interview Nancy described the ecumenical nature of attending different churches in the settlement on Sundays and on other weekdays:</p>
<p>"We had a lot of children of different races and different creeds. Everybody belonged to a different church, but every Sunday we started off with Mass at six o’clock in the morning. Nine o’clock we’d go to Protestant church. Sunday afternoon we would go to the Mormon Church, and then Monday evening there’s another church service, it could be a Filipino church service. And then there’s another one during the week, ...a Buddhist."</p>
<p>Nancy also praised the staff and again gave profound thanks to God:</p>
<p>“The staff...brought so much love into our hearts. And though we suffered, it was a lot of pain and suffering, a lot of tears, but I can look back and thank God for those tears because for many of us it brought us closer to Him, and through the years it nurtured our lives. We can think back and say, for one thing we were close to God. God kept us these years, and that is the reason why we are still here today. God kept us. And many of us can truly say, without his love, we would not be here. Many times I think about the people who brought all that love into our hearts. I know even though they’re not here with us, I can still thank them, thank them with all my heart, because they were a part of our lives. They’re really looking down on us. We had a lot of good doctors there and the nuns also. But there was a lot of joy and happiness, a lot of young people also. But God kept us through all these years and really how thankful we are. I guess so many of us now can think back and say, ‘Well, in spite of the pain, God has still seen us through all that heartache and the pain. And we can still praise Him and thank Him.’”<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Nancy Brede, another patient who came to Kalaupapa in 1936 at age fourteen, shared her experience of prayer and the importance of expressing gratitude to God, even in times of adversity:</p>
<p>“God knows best for us. ...You must keep your faith no matter what comes into your life, you must still be able to thank the Lord for the many other blessings that we receive, and keep this faith all the time, no matter what comes into our life. Yeah. – Because I feel religion is not thanking God when everything is good; religion is thanking God when everything isn’t going right.”<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Several people who had contact with the Kalaupapa patients spoke of the unifying effects inherent in the suffering of this disease. For example, in his book Travels in Hawaii, Robert Louis Stevenson writing of his visit to Kalaupapa, remarked, “They were strangers to each other, collected by common calamity, disfigured, mortally sick, banished without sin from home and friends.” He further noted, “Few would understand the principle on which they were thus forfeited in all that makes life dear; many must have conceived their ostracism to be grounded in malevolent caprice; all came with sorrow at heart, many with despair and rage. In the chronicle of man there is perhaps no more melancholy landing than this.”<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;Stevenson observed, among the “sights of pain in a land of disease and disfigurement, bright examples of fortitude and kindness, moral beauty, physical horror, intimately knit.”<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup> The patients were not to be overcome. As a result of their collective cooperative experience, they became one, which didn’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Author Ethel H. Damon was also discerning, stating, “Surely the isolation of suffering has tended toward obliterating the barriers in religious observance.”<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup> Reverend James Drew observed, “They are brothers and sisters here. ...Leprosy has made sure of that.”<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup> Paul Harada, a Japanese patient, echoed this same theme: “The more we suffer, the more strength we have. The more suffering, the closer we are together. Life is that way. If you haven’t suffered, then you don’t know what joy is. The others may know something about joy, but those who have gone through hell and high water, I think they feel the joy deeper.”<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup> In referring to the Kalaupapa community in another setting, Harada said, “We are all friends. There is an ecumenical philosophy here.”<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup> Commenting about his life in a paradise amid the Kalaupapa community, Jack Sing said simply, “We are all brothers and sisters...we help each other.”<sup><a href="#FN22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Journalist Ernie Pyle recalled, “My stay on Kalaupapa was one of the most powerful adventures in my life. ...It was a feeling something like this: out of the defilement and abuse that nature had heaped upon those people, there had arisen over Kalaupapa an atmosphere that was surely spiritual, almost heavenly. It was a strange atmosphere of calm—a calm that was invitational, and almost irresistible.”<sup><a href="#FN23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Lawrence M. Judd, Kalaupapa superintendent (1947-1949), was deeply moved serving this loving community stated, “I know of no land or people who can grow into one’s heart more than Kalaupapa and its people. I am sure God smiled with great delight when HE finished Kalaupapa. He left with it and its people much of HIS love and the beauty of HIS own soul. I feel certain HE built himself into it and has since glorified it with his frequent presence.”<sup><a href="#FN24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Our own beloved Brother David Hannemann, a missionary at Kalaupapa in 1949 during the Judd era remembered, “The six months I spent in Kalaupapa was different than any other experience. I spent the rest of my mission in other places, but my experiences in Kalaupapa really helped me as an individual to get along with people – to look beyond the physical appearance of an individual, and look at the heart.”<sup><a href="#FN25">25</a></sup> Elder Hannemann recalling his work with the scouts in Kalaupapa’s troop 46, simply noted, “Oh it is wonderful!” David also met with one of his troop members sixty-six years later at Hale Mohalu. I was privileged to listen to them reminisce over their scouting days which included the desire of a tender twelve-year-old boy that David would pray for his sick pet pig.<sup><a href="#FN26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>While reminiscing about the sixty-plus years of living at Kalaupapa, Mary Sing (Kalaupapa Relief Society President for decades along-side her husband Jack) recalled, “Everybody was living just like a family. Nobody says anything bad about the other religion. Everybody was together. See, they respected, you know, each church.” Mary added, “If the Catholic had a party, ...they wait for the Mormon people to get through with their service. ...And so [it] is with the Protestant, everybody was happy.”<sup><a href="#FN27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>There were many occasions which also created joy for the settlement. Richard Marks, a former patient, a Catholic, and the sheriff of Kalaupapa for nearly two decades (proud of his record of “no arrests”), related a humorous anecdote.<sup><a href="#FN28">28</a></sup> In describing the Christmas Catholic mass at Kalaupapa, Marks explained, “The Protestants and the Mormons came early and they took the back seats so we had to sit up front.”<sup><a href="#FN29">29</a></sup> Boogie, another patient of the same faith added, “We know all about the things we went through. ...I think that’s one [reason we feel like a family]. ...When we had a function going on, the whole community just comes together.”<sup><a href="#FN30">30</a></sup> A patient active in the Protestant community recalled, “Us and the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church, we’re always getting together. When it was something big, we always join together and enjoy it.”<sup><a href="#FN31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>This description of the Kalaupapa ohana (family) happiness was also expressed by Edwin Lelepali, affectionately known as “Pali,” sent to Kalaupapa in 1942. Pali expressed his joy and gratitude when members of the settlement joined in 1966 to help reconstruct the Protestant Siloama Chapel. He noted, “We had the Protestants, we had the Catholics, we had the Mormons all chip in to build this Church. ...They wanted to help this Church. ...When you came here you could feel the spirit of love. It was special working with them. ...It was just beautiful. I can never thank them enough. It was wonderful.”<sup><a href="#FN32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>When asked if the same was true when a twentieth-century Catholic Church was erected, Pali explained that all joined in “to help raise some funds for the Church. ...Everybody would help out and that’s how it was in Kalaupapa. That’s what’s so different about Kalaupapa, when somebody needs help, everybody’s there.” He continued, “This is our family. ...I don’t care what religion. ...That’s how we felt. When they need help, we [are] there, see? ...We always go. You don’t have to ask us, we just come out and help. That’s how we were brought up here in Kalaupapa. Somehow that great love for everybody brought us together.”<sup><a href="#FN33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>The same spirit of love and collaboration that existed during the construction of the Catholic and Protestant churches was also evident when a new Latter-day Saint chapel was built to replace the older 1904 chapel, which had deteriorated. When the building was dedicated at the close of 1965 and the work hours tallied, it was discovered that those of other faiths had actually donated more hours in its construction than the Latter-day Saints had. “All worked hard, and some of those with disabilities had their hands wired to the wheelbarrows that they might do their share.”</p>
<p>The entire settlement joined in celebration over the knowledge that their LDS friends had a new chapel to worship in.<sup><a href="#FN34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Celebrations and music were important to the community. Entertainers such as Laie resident, B. J. Lee, felt the impact of this close-knit community when she reached out as a voluntary performer on many occasions with her musical friends Hanaloa Niapali and Cissy Fong: Lee recalled, “The flight to Kalaupapa...is always a thrill for me to visit that place at the end of the rainbow. I always say that the Lord made that island very special by adding the Kalaupapa Peninsula.” She added, “Returning from Kalaupapa is a renewal of life. You return richer with love for the unfortunate—the physically, spiritually, and emotionally unfortunate. You search your soul to assess values, your dealings with your family; friends, neighbors. What good one has done in the world.”<sup><a href="#FN35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>After over a decade of research, interviews, expeditions, and contemplation, I believe I’ve identified the settlement’s secrets. It is the story of community—community unlike anywhere else in the world—not a space divided by borders and barriers or fences and enclosures, but a place which beckons every race and religion, every color and creed. Kalaupapa is proof that community is possible, though not without price. The cost was suffering—suffering together. Anyone who explores the story of Kalaupapa uncovers the rich charity beneath its surface. Kalaupapa serves as a reminder of the importance of erecting bridges instead of barriers, finding common ground instead of battleground, and in valuing one another regardless of ethnicity and religiosity. It motivates us to generate light instead of heat and to look outside the circle of our faith’s community, to be inclusive in joining hands to render loving service to others.</p>
<p>Kalaupapa is an epic tale of human triumph. It begins as a tragedy and culminates in a storybook ending. A devastating plague ravishes a population, but then a community is forged in love, free of universal ignorance, prejudice, and pride. The separating sickness that initially tore people away from those they loved subsequently united them with strangers who became their Ohana. The community of Kalaupapa achieved what has yet to be accomplished in any society I know of. Healthy or sick, black or white, bond or free, Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist, or Mormon, all were equal and beloved. Each denomination lived above their precepts and pleased God in the process. Heroes walked among the patients. Men and women offered and risked their lives to assure the wellbeing of patients as they tenderly ministered to the destitute. Regardless of one’s ethnicity or religiosity, the story of Kalaupapa delivers a powerful universal message: “In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things, charity.”<sup><a href="#FN36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>I was pondering this powerful message this past Saturday morning on the eve of Easter as I drove to the Northshore to watch the surfing action at pipeline. I pulled off the road at Kahuku and decided I would try to introduce myself to the Catholic priest at the St. Roch Church whose name is Father Jun Pastrano. He came out dressed in shorts and a casual shirt as I was and we had a wonderful visit on his porch. I told him why I was in town and a few highlights of this Kalaupapa devotional. After leaving him with books I had written on the subject, I then went a little ways down the road and knocked on the door of the United Methodist minister’s house and introduced myself to Pastor Tevita Maile and his wife. Pastor Maile was preparing his Easter sermon, but still made time for me. I found out we shared a past common friend in Viliami Afiaki and that he also knew Viliami Tolutau. We had a nice visit together.</p>
<p>The following morning as Easter dawned, I went to the St. Roch Church and arrived about the same time that Father Pastrano did. He soon told a prisoner that I was a bishop and also informed me that he had talked about the journey to Kalaupapa in his Saturday evening mass the night before. I was soon asked to introduce myself to the congregation along with other visitors and was edified by the hymns we sang together, which included “All Creatures of our God and King,” written by St. Francis of Assii eight hundred years ago.</p>
<p>I also visited the United Methodist Church and was asked to introduce myself by Pastor Tevita Maile. After I finished, he told the congregation: “Fred is giving a inter-faith lecture at BYU-Hawaii and all are invited to attend. He believes we all worship the same God.” We then sang the hymn written by the Methodist Christian missionary, Charles Wesley which was the same hymn I sang that day with the Saints of the Laie Second Ward, “Christ the Lord is Risen Today,” written before the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized in 1830.</p>
<p>As I have pondered over these hymns written by inspired men before the dawn of the Restoration with my Catholic and Methodist brothers and sisters, I was again reminded of the Latin maxim which I again invite you to reflect upon: “In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty, and in all things charity.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know that our Heavenly Father lives and that he loves us. I know we are his children. I testify that God sent his Only Begotten Son to die for us and to show us the way back home. I know that people of all faiths can recognize that we are true followers of God and of the Christ by our love for each other and for all of our Father’s children. I testify of the power to bring unity through charity.</p>
<p>“Charity is the pure love of God, and it endureth forever, and whoso is possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him”<sup><a href="#FN37">37</a></sup> in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow</p>
<p>I am grateful for my wife, Sharon. &nbsp;I hope you could sense her goodness as she has just addressed you. &nbsp;She makes my life’s journey so much the better for having her at my side …</p>
<p>My wife is a survivor. Not only has she survived 38 years married to me but she survived a night lost in the Kahana Valley. &nbsp;The October night she didn’t come home gave me a unique perspective. &nbsp;It made me realize more completely how much I love her and how much I depend on her. &nbsp;We learned a few practical things as well: &nbsp;That you should always let someone know where you are going; that it’s wise to stop hiking before it gets dark; and that the search and rescue people truly are heroes. &nbsp;We remain grateful to all in the community who stopped what they were doing to help find her and our two friends.</p>
<p>Perspective is an important aspect when it comes to living a rich life.</p>
<p>I invite each of us to listen carefully to the promptings of the spirit and to heed those promptings. &nbsp;Whether it be a prompting to pray more sincerely, to study the scriptures more effectively, to turn our hearts to our Savior and repent of our sins, to serve others we come in contact with, or to call a friend … I promise that as we listen the spirit will speak to our hearts.</p>
<p>As a young boy I remember cold winter days. I grew up in New Jersey and we would occasionally have ice storms where the ice covered the trees and streets and made travel difficult. &nbsp;… as the sun would come up on these days it would warm my face and body. &nbsp;I enjoyed turning towards the sun and soaking in the warmth. &nbsp;I hope you can picture some scenario like this in your life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in Hawaii you might get that same feeling when standing by the ocean as the sun rises in the eastern sky. I can see myself closing my eyes and letting the rays of the sun sink in … feeling its warmth over my body. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is this warmth from the sun that I would like us to keep in mind as we spend a few minutes together this morning. &nbsp;It gives us warmth and peace and is symbolic of the warmth and peace that comes from applying the doctrine of Christ to our lives.</p>
<p>The sun will come out tomorrow.</p>
<p>You may recall the play Annie; it revolves around one little girl who is left at the entrance to an orphanage. &nbsp;She is left with a silver pendant’s half and the other half is kept by her parents so they can be identified, if they come to take her out of the shelter someday. &nbsp;Annie keeps a positive attitude as she experiences the difficulties of life in the orphanage. &nbsp;She sings the song “tomorrow” to remind her to keep looking for the good in life. &nbsp;Picture this curly red headed little girl with me as I share some of the words she sings:</p>
<p>"The sun will come out tomorrow</p>
<p>Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow</p>
<p>There'll be sun</p>
<p>Just thinkin' about tomorrow</p>
<p>Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 'til there's none</p>
<p>When I'm stuck with a day that's grey and lonely</p>
<p>I just stick up my chin and grin and say, oh</p>
<p>The sun will come out tomorrow</p>
<p>So you gotta hang on</p>
<p>'til tomorrow, come what may!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow</p>
<p>You're only a day away!"</p>
<p>There are many examples of those who have overcome great odds and have kept or regained a great outlook on life.</p>
<p>Alma the younger had many if not all the good things in life. &nbsp;It seems he was loved by his parents, well educated, but somewhat of a problem child. &nbsp;His father prayed and in fact had the whole church pray for his young son Alma and for the Sons of King Mosiah who had strayed from the teachings of the Church. &nbsp;They did experience a remarkable change of heart, and regained a joyful outlook on life. &nbsp;Alma shared his experience with his son Helaman:</p>
<p>&nbsp;And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</p>
<p>&nbsp; And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp; And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="#FN1"></a></sup>After this experience, to Alma the sun came up a little clearer and a little brighter each day than it had before.</p>
<p>When we served in Texas, we knew two missionaries that lived in the same circumstances … but had different attitudes. &nbsp;They were assigned to the same place, one right after the other. &nbsp;The first Elder was particularly unhappy. &nbsp;My wife called to check on him and asked how he was doing in his area. “Oh, Sister Lyons, it’s difficult up here. &nbsp;My apartment is awful, my companion is difficult and the members aren’t helpful at all.” &nbsp;Soon after, this Elder was transferred to another area in the mission. &nbsp;Concerned about the general conditions in the apartment and area, Sister Lyons called the missionary that replaced him to see how he was getting along. &nbsp;“Sister Lyons, I love this area. My apartment is super, my companion is great and the members are so anxious to help. Things couldn’t be better.”</p>
<p>What changed? &nbsp;Which of these missionaries are we more like? &nbsp;Do we see the sun coming up? Today? &nbsp;Tomorrow? &nbsp;Or are we waiting for someone else to show us the sunrise?</p>
<p>We each have opportunities to see a greater purpose in our lives, even when it may not be apparent to others. &nbsp;President Monson shared a wonderful poem that carries a powerful reminder of our purpose, called This Little Place:</p>
<p>“'Father, where shall I work today?'</p>
<p>And my love flowed warm and free.</p>
<p>Then he pointed out a tiny spot</p>
<p>And said, 'Tend that for me.'</p>
<p>I answered quickly, 'Oh no, not that!</p>
<p>Why, no one would ever see,</p>
<p>No matter how well my work was done.</p>
<p>Not that little place for me.'</p>
<p>And the word he spoke, it was not stern; …&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Art thou working for them or for me?</p>
<p>Nazareth was a little place,</p>
<p>And so was Galilee.'”</p>
<p>Years ago, after moving to a home in Murray Utah a kind neighbor brought over a box of tulip bulbs that were surplus from the abundant crop they had recently thinned. We were excited to add them to our new landscape and worked hard that fall to get them all planted. The wintry weather arrived early that year and although we planted many of them the ground froze before we got all the bulbs snuggly settled in the rich soil. Several of the bulbs were left in the cardboard box and abandoned in the garage forgotten through the long winter.</p>
<p>As spring came we noticed the planted bulbs pushing up green shoots through the newly thawed ground. We could hardly wait for them to bloom. It was not until then that we remembered the other bulbs, the ones that never got planted. We felt bad that the spring display of bright colorful tulips would be less than what it could have been. We found the box with the unplanted bulbs in the back corner of the garage while rummaging for gardening tools. My wife took the box to the garbage can planning to throw out the deserted bulbs but to her surprise she saw that they were also sending up shoots. These tender little plants were doing their best to fulfill the measure of their creation under much less than ideal circumstances. The other tulips had been nurtured beneath the soil while these little bulbs were doing their best to push out their blooms without the benefit of dirt or sun in a cold dark garage. We took these brave little bulbs and immediately planted them in the same flower beds as the others. In a matter of weeks, they had caught up to those previously planted bulbs and by the time they bloomed you couldn’t tell them apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since God made it possible for tulips to bloom under less than ideal conditions, imagine how infinitely greater He has endowed each of us with the capacity to progress and prosper through difficult life situations.</p>
<p>We can blossom where we are planted. &nbsp;President Hinckley was so good at reminding us to keep moving forward and to recognize the silver linings in the clouds. &nbsp;He shared these words of Jenkins Lloyd Jones clipped from a column in the Deseret News some years ago:</p>
<p>“Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed.</p>
<p>“Most putts don’t drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. …</p>
<p>“Life is like an old-time rail journey—delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed.</p>
<p>“The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Another wonderful example of finding purpose in life is Helen Keller&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helen was born in Alabama in 1880. &nbsp;She suffered an illness that left her both deaf and blind before her 2nd birthday. &nbsp;She was extremely intelligent and became frustrated as she tried to understand and make sense of her surroundings. When Helen felt the moving lips of family members and realized that they used their mouths to speak, “she flew into a rage because she was unable to join in the conversation.” By the time Helen was six, her need to communicate and her frustration grew so intense that her “outbursts occurred daily, sometimes hourly.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helen’s parents hired a teacher for their daughter, a woman named Anne Sullivan. &nbsp; Anne had struggled with her own serious hardships and understood Helen’s infirmities. At age five, Anne had contracted a disease that caused painful scarring of the cornea and left her mostly blind. When Anne was eight, her mother died; her father abandoned her and her younger brother, Jimmie; and they were sent to a “poor house,” where conditions were so deplorable that Jimmie died after only three months. Through her own dogged persistence, Anne gained entry to the Perkins School for the Blind and vision impaired, where she succeeded brilliantly. A surgical operation gave her improved vision so that she was able to read print. When Helen Keller’s father contacted the Perkins School seeking someone to become a teacher for his daughter, Anne Sullivan was selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant experience at the beginning. Helen “hit, pinched and kicked her teacher and knocked out one of her teeth. &nbsp;Anne finally gained control by moving with Helen into a small cottage on the Kellers’ property. &nbsp;Through patience and firm consistency, she finally won the child’s heart and trust.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>To help Helen learn words, Anne would spell the names of familiar objects with her finger on the palm of Helen’s hand. &nbsp;“Helen enjoyed this ‘finger play,’ but she didn’t understand until the famous moment when Anne spelled ‘w-a-t-e-r’ while pumping water over Helen’s hand. &nbsp;Helen later wrote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten--a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. &nbsp;I knew then that "w-a-t-e-r" meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. &nbsp;That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! … Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought. &nbsp;As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In a recent general conference address Elder Christofferson likened Helen’s experience to our opportunity to fulfill our divine potential: “We may be quite content with what we have done in our lives and that we simply are what we are, while our Savior comprehends a glorious potential that we perceive only “through a glass, darkly.” &nbsp;Each of us can experience the ecstasy of divine potential unfolding within us, much like the joy Helen Keller felt when words came to life, giving light to her soul and setting it free. &nbsp;Each of us can love and serve God and be empowered to bless our fellowman. &nbsp;“As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>We have in Jesus Christ one who understands all of our challenges and difficulties, as we come to trust Him, He can work with us to guide and lift us. &nbsp;Brothers and Sisters, have we figuratively moved into a cottage with our elder brother Jesus Christ? &nbsp;Are we still kicking? Or are we receiving his teaching guidance willingly?</p>
<p>Following a suspected prognosis of Multiple Sclerosis, a friend of mine hurried home from the Doctors to research the disease and find out what exactly that would mean for her future. She entered the initials into the search engine. &nbsp;The more she read the more devastated she became. &nbsp;It was a terrible disease. &nbsp;She felt like she couldn't stand to read any more about it. &nbsp;Glancing down to turn off her computer she realized that she had entered the Disease MD, Muscular Dystrophy, not MS into her search engine. &nbsp;She then entered MS into her computer and started reading. Although MS is also a debilitating disease her perspective was forever changed. &nbsp;This experience was a tender mercy for her. &nbsp;Since the onset of her illness she has always remained grateful that her physical challenge is Multiple Sclerosis and not Muscular Dystrophy.</p>
<p>A few years ago, our second son was accepted into Pharmacy school pending completion of a couple of classes that he was taking on line. &nbsp;Pharmacy school is a competitive doctorate program and he was concerned about being accepted from the beginning. &nbsp;He was incredibly relieved and delighted to get in. &nbsp;He worked to complete his online classes but it was summer and the teachers were often on vacation and slow to correct and return his homework. &nbsp;To be proactive, he talked to the admissions department at the Pharmacy school to let them know that he was cutting it close on the deadline to finish the classes. &nbsp;He was told that as long as the classes were completed before school started he would be fine. &nbsp;You can appreciate how discouraged he was when a different person contacted him later and told him he had been given the wrong information. &nbsp;If he couldn’t submit his grades the next day he would miss the deadline, would not be admitted for that year and would have to reapply to the program again. &nbsp;Getting the grades submitted in twenty-four hours was impossible. &nbsp;There was nothing he could do to make it happen. &nbsp;He was devastated. &nbsp;His first impulse was to give up completely. &nbsp;Playing video games in our basement for the rest of his life may have been his fall back plan. &nbsp;He was terribly discouraged, it took some time to bounce back, but he didn’t quit. &nbsp;He finished his classes, reapplied to school and was accepted for the following year. &nbsp;He graduated last June and is working as a pharmacist in a Utah hospital.</p>
<p>The sun will come up tomorrow.</p>
<p>We recently had an opportunity to go to Kalaupapa on the Island of Molokai. &nbsp;A dear friend arranged the visit and helped us do some service at the meetinghouse and surrounding buildings. &nbsp;We cleaned, we painted, we cut branches and bushes, etc. &nbsp;It looked better after we were done …you could say we made a difference that day, in a small way. &nbsp;But going to Kalaupapa made a big difference in us.</p>
<p>Our Heritage includes a brief summary of early church members’ experiences at Kalaupapa: “Beginning in 1866, to prevent the spread of leprosy, Hawaiian officials took people suffering from the disease to the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the island of Molokai. &nbsp;In 1873 Jonathan and Kitty Napela, who were Latter-day Saints, were banished there. &nbsp;Only Kitty had the disease, but Jonathan, who had been sealed to her in the Salt Lake Endowment House, would not leave her there alone. &nbsp;Jonathan later contracted the disfiguring disease, and when he was visited nine years later by a good friend, was hardly recognizable. &nbsp;For some time, he presided over the Saints on the peninsula, who by the year 1900 numbered more than 200. &nbsp;Church leaders did not forget the faithful members who suffered from this debilitating disease and frequently visited the branch to care for their spiritual needs”.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>A returned missionary who served in Hawaii shared the following experience: “A few weeks after I arrived in Hawaii to serve my mission, my companion, Elder Naylor, and I planned to visit Hale Mohalu, a leper hospital in Pearl City. &nbsp;We were going to visit a member of the Church, Joe Kekahuna.</p>
<p>I was unnerved by the prospect of being close to someone with leprosy, a disease that has been called “death in life.” &nbsp;Weren’t these the people who in biblical times were forced to call out “unclean” to anyone who approached them? &nbsp;Was there any chance that I might contract leprosy?</p>
<p>My companion, sensing my anxiety, explained, “To begin with, we don’t call it leprosy; we call it Hansen’s disease. &nbsp;Hansen’s disease isn’t as contagious as many people think. &nbsp;I visited the leper colony at Kalaupapa twice a month during the whole time I was on Molokai. &nbsp;I’m not afraid, and there’s no reason you should be.”</p>
<p>We went to Hale Mohalu the next day. &nbsp;The patients we passed on the way to Joe’s room looked very normal, and I was feeling much better about the experience—until I saw Joe and all my apprehensions returned. &nbsp;His body was in an advanced stage of deterioration. &nbsp;I felt my heart would break with pity for him.</p>
<p>I mumbled a greeting and then fell silent, not knowing what to say. &nbsp;Joe sensed my uncertainty, turned his sightless eyes in my direction, and began to speak to me.</p>
<p>“Don’t feel sorry for me, elder,” he said. &nbsp;“I am a dying man, but I am a happy man, too. &nbsp;When I was young, like you, I thought I would live forever. &nbsp;I did bad things. &nbsp;I was a hard man, who would never listen to the missionaries. &nbsp;I liked my good time; I had no place in my life for God. &nbsp;This disease sent me to Molokai, to Kalaupapa, where I lived among the lepers. &nbsp;I found God in Kalaupapa, and I found the Church.”</p>
<p>His voice broke with emotion as he continued, “I’m glad I have this disease. &nbsp;Without it, I would be the same as I was, and there would be no future for me. &nbsp;I would have lost everything. &nbsp;Learn from me, elder. &nbsp;Learn from Joe Kekahuna, the leper.”</p>
<p>The returned missionary’s account ends with: &nbsp;Joe’s words changed my pity into feelings of gratitude. &nbsp;Our visit with him was very short, but his insight will stay with me forever. &nbsp;I learned that no matter how bad or uncertain our circumstances may be, the most important thing in life is to be close to God.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>On our visit, as we performed our service at the Church, walked the grounds, thought of the lives we had studied before we arrived, like those of Joe Kekahuna; as all of this rested upon our souls we were changed by Kalaupapa. &nbsp;I am still learning to appreciate Elder Mathew Cowley’s words which he shared after his visit to Kalaupapa:</p>
<p>“I went there apprehending that I would be depressed. I left knowing that I had been exalted. I had expected that my heart, which is not too strong, would be torn with sympathy, but I went away with a feeling that it had been healed. . ..</p>
<p>I went away . . . appreciating my friends, loving my enemies, worshiping God, and with a heart purged of all pettiness. This is a transformation for me and for it I am indebted to the . . . Saints of Kalaupapa”.<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: “Patient endurance permits us to cling to our faith in the Lord and our faith in His timing when we are being tossed about by the surf of circumstance. &nbsp;Even when a seeming undertow grasps us, somehow, in the tumbling, we are being carried forward, though battered and bruised.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>As we recall turning toward the sun to receive warmth and peace during a cold winter day or from the rising sun on a beautiful ocean before us, let’s allow that memory to help us keep a positive joyful attitude in life. &nbsp;Likewise, as we face cold days and difficulties in our life’s challenges we can turn to our Savior to feel of his warmth and peace.</p>
<p>For me the reason the sun will come out tomorrow is because of our Savior, Jesus Christ. &nbsp;“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>As King Benjamin lead his people through terrible wars and challenges he stayed focused on Christ. &nbsp;He taught his people of Christ and set a Christ-like example by his actions. &nbsp;He invited them to repent of their sins and to follow Christ. &nbsp;They accepted his invitation and the result was marvelous:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. &nbsp;And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</p>
<p>&nbsp; And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them”.<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>May we be willing to do our best each day, to plead for mercy and apply the atoning blood of Christ, every day. &nbsp;The sun that comes out each morning as well as all of nature point us to Jesus Christ. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I share my witness that our Father in Heaven lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of all mankind. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>4 April 2017<br />Ualani Mo&#039;o Nagy<br />Executive Assistant for Vice President, Student Development &amp; Services<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear Brothers and Sisters, ALOHA!!</p>
<p>I am so humbled to stand before you today. I feel greatly honored and privileged for this opportunity to address you. I would like to thank President Tanner and the President’s Council for extending an invitation to be the devotional speaker. I pray that the message I have been impressed to share, will uplift, inspire and motivate you in your commitment to being better disciples of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so blessed to live and work at this university. I am in a position where I witness the university administration at work daily. I am privileged to sit with the President’s Council every week in devotionals and feel the warmth of the spirit as I listen to inspiring spiritual thoughts and experiences. I witness the power of the Priesthood and the magnitude of the calling bestowed upon President Tanner and his Vice Presidents as they ensure that the mission of this school is being fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things that I enjoy at work is participating in Commencement Exercises. I am privileged to interact with general authorities and special guests as we assist them with robing of their regalia before the processional. I see the President’s Council, special guests, and faculty dressed in their regalia as they march into the Cannon Activities Center (CAC). I see graduating students with smiles beaming on their faces as they march into the CAC and afterwards when they are being congratulated with leis. It is such a wonderful and joyous occasion. Everyone is happy and a feeling of love and unity is felt around campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling of joy and happiness has been on my mind since I received this assignment to speak in Devotional. I have pondered, prayed and studied scriptures and words of our prophets on what I could say to you today. I have been impressed that I should speak to you about being happy.</p>
<p>Cultivate a spirit of happiness in your life by being optimistic, grateful, charitable and faithful. These virtues can help you to fulfill part of the university mission “to prepare students with character and integrity…”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is comforting to know that the Lord has promised you to “be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Choose Happiness</p>
<p>One thing that everyone wants in life is to be happy. For some of you, finding your eternal companion and being married will make you happy. For some, getting straight A’s will make you happy. For others, having a vehicle to drive will make you happy. Whatever reason it is, everyone wants to be happy. However, there are those who find happiness and satisfaction in activities that are against the commandments of God. They think they are finding true happiness but it is just a short-term happiness that does not last. Satan is ever vigilant as he “seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;If you give in to Satan’s enticings, the outcome could be disastrous, and painful. Our Heavenly Father wants you to be happy, he wants you to have the kind of happiness that is eternal. You have the knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ and you know of the “great plan of happiness.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Living the gospel will help you achieve eternal happiness.</p>
<p>The Lord has taught us that “men are that they might have joy.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I love what President Gordon B. Hinckley’s mother, Ada Bitner Hinckley, said, that “a happy attitude and a smiling countenance could boost one over almost any misfortune and that every individual was responsible for his own happiness.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>I have a great example of someone who exemplifies the quality of happiness. This person is very special to me. He is my father, Tehina Temanaha Mo’o. He is from French Polynesia, from Hikueru, a small atoll in the Tuamotu Islands. He grew up in humble beginnings. He started school at the age of 11 or 12 years old. He later went to Liahona High School in Tonga and served a mission for the Church in French Polynesia. After which, he came here to Laie to attend the Church College of Hawaii or BYU-Hawaii as it is known today. He met my mother (Marseilles Nepe Mo’o) here a young woman from Aotearoa, New Zealand. Here is a picture of my parents after one of the night shows at PCC, this is after they announced their engagement. They were both one of the first dancers at the Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC). They were later married and sealed in the Laie, Hawaii temple. My father is the young man in the middle, the drummer is his brother (Opura Mo’o) and the young women near the drummer is his sister (Mahana Pulotu). They came here to attend school. Their parents wanted their children to have an education so they were sent here. My grandparents were also asked to help in the Tahitian village at PCC. Here is a picture of my father and his sister at PCC. This was a popular photo that was used in the early years of PCC. My father graduated from BYU-Hawaii, he helped with construction on some of the buildings and TVA apartments on campus. He even built our family home on Iosepa Street. He worked at BYU-Hawaii for over 30 years before he retired. He is a hard-working, kind and generous man. He is funny and always happy. No matter what circumstance or situation would arise, my father would smile and remain optimistic. He did not say anything negative and he did not complain. He smiled and laughed all the time. Being around him made you feel good. What I love the most about my father is that he is a worthy priesthood holder and loves our Heavenly Father and Savior very much. He emulates the light of Christ and has a loving heart. He just radiates happiness. I have learned from his example the importance of having a positive outlook and being cheerful.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have a Positive Attitude</p>
<p>Cultivate a spirit of happiness in your life by being optimistic. You should choose to have a positive attitude. It is interesting how important your attitude can affect your life. No matter how old or young you are, your attitude whether positive or negative will affect you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said that “Latter-day Saints should be the most optimistic and the least pessimistic,” because you have the gospel of Jesus Christ in your life.<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>No one wants to be around someone who is pessimistic. They tend to complain more and treat others poorly. They bring others down and make them feel just as miserable as they are feeling. Negative thinking and negative attitudes affect your school work, relationships, church callings, work performance, and even your faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson taught:</p>
<p>“So much in life depends on our attitude. The way we choose to see things and respond to others makes all the difference. To do the best we can and then to choose to be happy about our circumstances, whatever they may be, can bring peace and contentment. … We can’t direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails. For maximum happiness, peace, and contentment, may we choose a positive attitude.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Having a positive attitude helps you to be happier in your life. Each of you will experience trials and challenges, it is part of the “great plan of happiness.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> With a positive attitude, you will be able to cope with your challenges better. You cannot control your circumstances but you can control how you will react to them. Each of you can develop a cheerful and optimistic attitude when you are confronted with difficult challenges in your lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the world you live in is full of negativity and pessimism, where criticism and fault-finding are common. Negative and unkind words are spoken more frequently than they should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley said this:</p>
<p>“I come … with a plea that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I’m suggesting that we accentuate the positive. I’m asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm that we more generously compliment virtue and effort… that we speak of one another’s virtues more than we speak of one another’s faults, that optimism replace pessimism.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></span></p>
<p>With a positive attitude, you will be much nicer and kinder to others. Always show kindness, it will make you happy as well as the recipient of your kindness happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Be Grateful &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultivate a spirit of happiness in your life by being grateful. If you have gratitude in your hearts, you are much happier. You appreciate the blessings you have and what you have received. You have much to be grateful for: the gospel in your lives; the atonement of the Savior; a living prophet of God; your church membership; friends and family. You should count your many blessings daily. One such blessing you should count on is the opportunity to attend BYU-Hawaii. This is a special and unique place that was envisioned by a prophet of God. There is only a small window of opportunity to learn here at BYU-Hawaii. Use your time wisely and learn all that you can so you can leave this school prepared to “go forth to serve.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Showing appreciation to those who bless you, helps you to think about others. However, showing lack of gratitude is offensive to God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In D&amp;C 59:21, it reads:</p>
<p>“And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Once you understand that you can kindle God’s wrath for the lack of appreciation, you will be more motivated to acknowledge all your blessings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share an example of a time when I was grateful for blessings I received:</p>
<p>In 2009, my Father passed away at the age of 71. As the news spread throughout the community, we received many phone calls and visits from family members, neighbors, ward members, coworkers, and friends. We received monetary gifts, dinners, and groceries – just an abundance of gifts. We even received the gift of music – singing, chanting and dancing. For several weeks, we received an outpouring of love. We were overwhelmed and touched by the generosity of so many. What was a sad time for us became a happy and joyous time because of the love and support that we received from the community. It felt like a big party for our family as we gathered every night to eat and mingle together with visitors. What I remember most at the time, was how everyone made us feel so loved and cared for. Going through this experience makes the plan of happiness much more real to me and it makes me appreciate it more. I know that I will see my Father again. That brings joy to my heart and strengthens my faith. After this experience, it motivated me to want to give service to others especially to those who must go through a family member’s death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will always be grateful to all those who blessed our family in our time of need. Their gift of love and service brought a spirit of warmth and happiness into our lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Serve Others &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultivate a spirit of happiness in your lives by serving others. Each of you can be an instrument in the Lord’s hands by helping those in need. Let us forget ourselves and reach out to others. You should put aside your own personal interests and serve. Why should you serve?&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball has counseled us:</p>
<p>“Service to others deepens and sweetens this life while we are preparing to live in a better world. It is by serving that we learn how to serve. When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves! In the midst of the miracle of serving, there is the promise of Jesus that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves!”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>You can follow the Savior’s example for he “went about doing good.”<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup> His work was about serving and blessing others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share a story of when I was able to give service to someone:</p>
<p>In 2011, two years after my Father passed away, my cousin, Tamara Mo’o Ulima Soliai’s husband passed away leaving five young children ages 6 to 17 behind. Our family was shocked and saddened by the ordeal. This time I could give back and help support my cousin with love. I could provide some comfort and peace that I knew she was going through because we had gone through it before. I was grateful that I could give of my time by being there for her. Because I received service from others it helped me to render service to her and her family. I didn’t do anything big or spectacular. I didn’t do anything that was physically strenuous or tiring. I was just there for her, in person, to offer a helpful hand and a shoulder to lean on or cry on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t take much to give service. Start with a kind word, a smile, a warm hello, a friendly text or just being there, are a few simple things you can do. Make your service genuine and with love. You should be “anxiously engaged in a good cause … For the power is in [you].”<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup> You have the power to help and serve others, you should take every opportunity to do so. When you serve remember, “God loveth a cheerful giver.”<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson counsels us:</p>
<p>“Let us examine our lives and determine to follow the Savior’s example by being kind, loving, and charitable. As we do so, we will be in a better position to call down the powers of heaven for ourselves, for our families, and for our fellow travelers in this sometimes difficult journey back to our heavenly home.”<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to serve and volunteer in many organizations that my children were involved in and it really blessed my life. I made many good friends and I learned new leadership and organizational skills. It allowed me to help my children pursue their interests and to enhance their talents and abilities. It helped me build closer relationships with my children and their friends. Some of my children’s best friends even call me Mom. I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve and for the joy it has brought into my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have Faith</p>
<p>Cultivate a spirit of happiness in your life by being faithful. The first principle of the Gospel is Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. “If ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.”<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup> When you have faith, you believe in him and you trust in him during times of need. The Lord promises, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>I would like to share a story where I faced a trial and had to rely on my faith in the Lord to overcome it:</p>
<p>Several years ago, I received bad news that was devastating to me. I was crushed and felt as if my whole world was turning upside down. All I could think of was, why me? &nbsp;Why is this happening to me? &nbsp;I took the bad news to heart and was overcome with emotion. I felt sadness, hurt, and disappointment. For the next few days, I humbled myself and prayed fervently to our Heavenly Father for help and for answers. I went to the temple to seek peace and comfort. I just wanted this heartache that I was feeling to go away. After a few days, I received an overwhelming powerful feeling of comfort and peace. The whisperings of the spirit told me that everything will be alright. Everything will be fine. You have nothing to worry about. Immediately after receiving those thoughts, I then felt a surprising feeling of reprimand from our Heavenly Father. These words came to me so strongly. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Be grateful for all your blessings. Be grateful and just be happy. I had to endure this trial for several months, but I did so with a positive attitude and with faith in my Heavenly Father. I knew that I would be alright and that everything would be fine. I was blessed immensely after this trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our times of trials how many of you turn to the Lord asking, why me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord said, “Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly…”<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott said this:</p>
<p>“When you face adversity, you can be led to ask many questions. Some serve a useful purpose; others do not. To ask, Why does this have to happen to me? Why do I have to suffer this, now? What have I done to cause this? will lead you into blind alleys. It really does no good to ask questions that reflect opposition to the will of God. Rather ask, What am I to do? What am I to learn from this experience? What am I to change? Whom am I to help? How can I remember my many blessings in times of trial? Willing sacrifice of deeply held personal desires in favor of the will of God is very hard to do. Yet, when you pray with real conviction, “Please let me know Thy will” and “May Thy will be done,” you are in the strongest position to receive the maximum help from your loving Father.”<a href="#FN21">21</a></p>
<p>I would like to share another example of faith demonstrated by my father and grandparents.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the story of my father and my grandparents. It took a lot of faith for my grandparents to send their two sons, my father and my Uncle to Tonga to attend Liahona High School. They didn’t speak the language and did not know much about their culture. My grandparents wanted their sons to attend a Church school and to further their education. They had to be faithful and put their faith and trust in the Lord. Similarly, they were also sent here to Hawaii to attend school. They didn’t know the language either. They had language barriers and cultural issues to overcome. These challenges were faced with a positive attitude and with faith in our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many of you who come from the Pacific Islands or Asian countries or other foreign countries with English as your second language. For some, you are the first generation from your family to attend college. Your family has high hopes for you, they have the faith that you will graduate and return to them to serve in your countries. I encourage you to take every opportunity to learn and to work hard – in your studies, your jobs, your church callings, your service and your activities. Also, take the opportunity to increase your spiritual growth. This campus is a great training ground for you to do so. Live the gospel and keep the commandments so you can have the Holy Ghost as your constant companion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said this:</p>
<p>“We must live the gospel in such a way that we will have the Spirt to ever be with us. If we live worthily, the Spirit will always be with us. We can then teach by the Spirit. …The reason we pray, study the scriptures, have good friends, and live the gospel through obedience to the commandments is so that when – not if, but when – the trials come, we are ready."<sup><a href="#FN22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>As you keep the commandments and live gospel principles, you will have the constant companionship of the Spirit. The whisperings of the Spirit will come to you when you least expect it.</p>
<p>This is a time when I received a prompting from the Spirit. Let’s return one last time to my Father’s story. One night, I was watching my Father working on the new edition of our family home. He was wearing his tool belt and he was working so hard. He was laying the tiles on the floor and trimming some of the tiles so they would fit just right. He loved to work. He was in his element and he was happy. Suddenly, a thought came to my mind. The thought was that my Father was leaving soon. I wondered to myself, perhaps he is going on a trip soon so I dismissed the thought. Two days later, my Father passed away. I was immediately taken back to that moment when I received the thought. It was an impression from the Spirit. I received a personal revelation that my Father was leaving, little did I know, that he would be departing this earth life.</p>
<p>I hope you will learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. By living the gospel and keeping the commandments the Spirit will always be with you. This will cultivate a spirit of happiness in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was younger, I was so excited to show off one of my school pictures to my parents. I thought it was a great picture, my father thought otherwise. He told me I didn’t see your smile. So I pointed to the close-lipped smile in the photo. He said that I need to practice smiling in the mirror. He took me in front of the mirror and went on to show me how to form my lips and show just enough teeth but not too much. I thought it was so silly. Later, in my early teens, I did take my father's advice and practiced smiling in front of the mirror. So, Dad, I know you’re listening and you’re smiling. I am smiling too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, be happy! Enjoy your life! Cherish every moment that you have here at BYU-Hawaii!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</p>
<p>I am so grateful and blessed to work at this fine university. I hope the stories that I have shared with you will help uplift, inspire, and motivate you to becoming better disciples of Jesus Christ. We discussed how you can cultivate a spirit of happiness in your life by being optimistic, grateful, charitable and faithful. Cultivating these virtues helps you to build your character and integrity which blesses your life and the lives of others. Having faith and relying on the Lord will help you. Living the gospel teachings and keeping the commandments will help you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father wants you to be happy, he wants you to succeed, he loves you. Remember what the Lord has promised, to “be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you…”<sup><a href="#FN23">23</a></sup> This is my testimony that I leave with you, humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>23 March 2017<br />Elder David F. Evans<br />General Authority<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>[Sister Evans]</p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>We were so pleased when we received this assignment to participate in this devotional today. We flew here from Hong Kong. Immediately after this gathering we will fly on to Las Vegas. You may wonder why a General Authority would be flying on to Las Vegas, but it's so that we can meet our newest grandson, little William Evans Bybee, who is just one month old. After spending a day with William and his family we will make our way to Salt Lake City where, along with you, we will enjoy General Conference. Then we return to Hong Kong and our work there.</p>
<p>David and I met in 1970 when we were at the University of Utah. We dated for about a year and found ourselves falling in love. Our dating was put on hold when he received a call to serve in the Japan, Tokyo Mission. He left and I continued my schooling. I can’t imagine how different our lives would have been had he not anticipated and accepted that call. His mission has enriched both of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were married shortly after he returned from Japan. We had decided early in our marriage that family was very important to us and so we were soon blessed with our first baby. That number became eight. Now all eight children are grown and married, each having been sealed to their sweethearts in the temple. Little William is our 26th grandchild.</p>
<p>Can I tell you a little about my husband?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder David F. Evans was born in 1951 and was sustained a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on April 2, 2005, almost 12 years ago. Before being called as a General Authority, he served as a full-time missionary, a bishop, a stake president, and as president of the Japan Nagoya Mission. His first assignment as a General Authority was to be in the Asia North Area Presidency where he served several years as the President of that area. We lived in Tokyo during that assignment. Afterwards he was assigned to church headquarters. From 2011 to 2015 he served as the Executive Director of the Missionary Department. Now he serves in the Asia Area Presidency and we live in Hong Kong, the headquarters of the Asia Area of the church.</p>
<p>In 1976, Dave received his bachelor's degree from the University of Utah and in 1979, he received his Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University. His professional career involved working as an attorney and as an executive for an investment banking firm.</p>
<p>We’ve lived a more different life than we could have ever imagined. One of our greatest blessings is to be together and to serve together. I am so grateful for this man that I married. We both love the Lord and we both know that the work that we are doing is what the Lord would have us to do. Now, Elder Evans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Elder Evans]</p>
<p>Well, we are very grateful to be here with each of you today. The last day or two has been a remarkable experience of reunion and happiness for us. Forty-seven years ago I came here as a called missionary to the old LTM, which was located here, and I had the opportunity to be taught Japanese by Kats Kagiama. Perhaps many of you have had that same blessing. After all these years to be together again, even though we've had other opportunities to be together, it's been a sweet opportunity of reunion. We've also had a reunion with some of our missionaries from Japan and we've also had an opportunity to visit the sister missionaries at the Visitor's Center. We just couldn't have had a better welcome and we will leave with memories that will sustain us for a long, long time. I just want you to know that before I give my formal message. how blessed you are to be in this remarkable place. Studying, being here, being taught by President and Sister Tanner, and being taught by so many others...we are grateful for this assignment and thank you for coming here today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We bring you the love of the members of the Church in Asia. The Asia Area of the Church comprises 22 countries or territories, with half of the world’s population. In many countries of Asia, the Church is still emerging while in others, the Church is well established, with many members and stakes. In this wonderful part of the world, there are 2 temples (with one more announced that will be located in Bangkok, Thailand), 11 missions, 37 stakes, over 30 districts, and congregations found in 19 countries. Although we have half of the world’s population, we have only about 1% of the world’s Church membership. There are untold millions of people who need the message of the gospel preached to them and we, together with remarkable members and missionaries, are working with all our heart, might, mind and strength as we undertake this remarkable assignment.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Wherever I go, I try to meet with the youth and young single adults. I have come to love the many faces and languages found in this part of the world. You are not only the future of the world, but you're the future of the Church. I am pleased that among you there are 315 students from the Asia Area here at BYU Hawaii. These students come from 13 countries and you represent the very best of those whom the Lord is raising up to assume leadership in the wards, branches and, most importantly, families of Asia as you receive your education and then return to the countries from which you have come. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The doctrine of the gathering of Israel is one of the most important doctrines of the restoration. The reason for this is that not only do we seek to understand and teach this doctrine, but in our own way we actually participate in the gathering. It is because of this doctrine that we hope that after you receive your education in this and other institutions of higher education you will return to the country, culture and language from which you came. The gathering to where God placed each of us is a vital part of the Lord’s plan for you, your family, and for His Church and Kingdom. President Russell M. Nelson taught this important doctrine in this manner: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“This doctrine of the gathering is one of the important teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints...</p>
<p>“...in the early days of the Church, conversion often meant emigration... But now the gathering takes place in each nation. The Lord has decreed the establishment of Zion in each realm where He has given His Saints their birth and nationality. Scripture foretells that the people ‘shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.’ ‘Every nation is the gathering place for its own people.’"</p>
<p>Now I continue, "The place of gathering for Brazilian Saints is in Brazil; the place of gathering for Nigerian Saints is in Nigeria; the place of gathering for Korean Saints is in Korea; and so forth. Zion is ‘the pure in heart.’ Zion is wherever righteous Saints are. Publications, communications, and congregations are now such that nearly all members have access to the doctrines, keys, ordinances, and blessings of the gospel, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>“Spiritual security will always depend upon how one lives, not where one lives. Saints in every land have equal claim upon the blessings of the Lord.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I have now lived almost 10 years of my adult life in the Lord’s service in Asia. Consistently, I have seen that each new generation of leaders is largely composed of those who have come to understand the Lord’s doctrine concerning the need to gather back to the lands of their birth and nationality. These leaders made the choice to seek and follow the Lord’s will in this important matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, this may feel as if this is hard counsel or hard doctrine. For some of you, it will mean giving up some of things of comfort and, for some, even wealth. It means that your children will learn the language of their grandparents, rather than the language of some other country. For some of you, it will mean that you may not live in even as comfortable a place as you do as a student here at BYU Hawaii. It also means that, if you desire, the Lord will have provided a way for you to enter this wonderful university to learn, and you will have chosen to have faith and return to serve and build up His Kingdom. It will mean that as you are faithful now and later, you will look back on your life and realize that you have done what the Lord desired of you and that, even with sacrifice, it was worth it in every way. What I promise you, and what the Lord has already promised you, is that you and your family can be spiritually secure regardless of where you live, and that you will have enough as you first seek to do His will in your life. Your spiritual security, and that of your family, will depend on how you live the gospel, not by living in some different culture or country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I serve in the Asia Area Presidency now, my first assignment as a General Authority was to serve in the Asia North Area Presidency. We lived in Tokyo and traveled often to Korea and the islands of the Guam Micronesia Mission.</p>
<p>During those years, there were, perhaps, hundreds of meetings that I attended in Korea. Some of them were in small branches, and others were in the largest stakes. I had many feelings and impressions as I participated in teaching the gospel and in bearing testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. For me, one of the most important meetings did not happen at a church or in the temple. Rather, the meeting that may have had the greatest impact on my understanding of how the Lord desired to grow and more firmly establish His Church in Asia and other parts of the world happened in a busy restaurant with only four of us present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been assigned to preside at a Stake Conference in Korea. I asked Elder Choi Yoon Hwan, who was then an Area Seventy, to arrange a dinner appointment with the stake president. That evening, the Stake President, one of his counselors in the stake presidency, Elder Choi and I sat down to dinner and just talked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked the stake president whether he had known Elder Choi as they were growing up as young men in Korea. The stake president told me that he, Elder Choi and his counselor had all served missions together as young men. After their missions, they each had a variety of experiences that created opportunities for education and employment. In Elder Choi’s case, he left Korea and first came here to BYU Hawaii and then to Utah State University for his education. He and his wife, Bon, then chose to return to Korea, raise a family and serve the Lord. In each of the others’ lives, they had had educational and professional opportunities, but through their individual choices, they had chosen to stay in or return to Korea, marry, be sealed in the temple, and have children. They worked to build up the Church in Korea, the country that had given them the gospel as well as parents, family, birth, life, language and culture. Each had served as a bishop and as a member of a stake presidency, and each had made a significant contribution to the building up of the Lord’s church in that country. As many of you know, Elder Choi now serves as one of the General Authorities of the Church and is a member of the Asia North Area Presidency.</p>
<p>That evening, we talked about young men and women serving together and choosing to follow the Lord’s counsel to return to their country and work to build and strengthen the Church where they had been born. It was during this conversation that I first had come into my heart a spiritual understanding that the Lord would build up and more firmly establish His Church in each country, culture, language and people by having the rising generation accept His doctrine, and gather back to their own country. There they would work together to build up and strengthen the Church in that place. There they would establish multigenerational families who will be the spiritual strength of that country and place. That night, I not only heard the stories of these three men and their families, but I could also see so many others choosing to follow the Lord’s will in this matter, raising their families in spiritual security and happiness, and making contributions to His Church in their own country. These contributions can never be made, and this spiritual security can never be had, without accepting the Lord’s counsel and following His will in one’s life.</p>
<p>Now some of you will ask, “Can there be any exceptions to this pattern?” The answer is that surely there are exceptions. The exception is that there are some of you, maybe even many of you who have fallen in love with and married someone who is not of your culture, language or place. That's what happens at BYU Hawaii! The two of you will need to prayerfully consider your choices and make sure that the decisions you make are consistent with the Lord’s will for you and your family. Be sure to prayerfully consider the Lord’s teachings and seek His will in this most important family council and decision. Together with the decisions regarding the bringing of children into the world, I can think of no decision that will be made early in your marriage that will have a greater impact on the ultimate happiness and spiritual security of your family than this important decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you make the decisions that will affect your life and the lives of each member of your family and others, please remember that the spiritual guidance necessary to know whether your circumstances and choices are pleasing to the Lord will come as you first desire to do His will and then accept His doctrine, and then seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost in your life and the life of your family. He has always promised that those who keep His commandments and seek to do His will will have spiritual direction and guidance, and that “ the Holy Ghost, [will] show unto you all things what ye should do.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Another gospel truth that we must not forget is that our Heavenly Father, who loves us, will help us receive those things that we righteously desire. Alma said it this way: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, for I know that He granteth unto men according their desire...I know that He allotteth unto men...according to their wills...”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this kind of “desire”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> is not simply what we wish for or want. &nbsp;It is defined by those things that we are willing to live for, and work for over time. This is powerful doctrine. Of course, the way we show our desire to God is through what we do -- our actions and our works -- not just through our words, our wishes or even our prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior’s greatest desire was to do the will of the Father. He said, “Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you--that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> He also described how difficult it was even for Him to do His Father’s will. “...I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup> Just as in the Savior’s life, we will need to choose to follow the will of the Father daily, and &nbsp;throughout our lives. Indeed, continuing to choose the will of the Father becomes the mark of our discipleship. &nbsp;It is when we choose right and follow His will, especially when the choices feel difficult, that we grow the most in our love for God and our fellow man. This is how we become true disciples of the Lord, Jesus Christ. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months ago, I visited a city in the Asia Area where the gospel has been preached for many years. We had a devotional with some of the members of the church and had a period of questions and answers. One of the first questions was, “When will we become a stake?” I knew that a member of the Twelve had been in that same city about a year earlier. &nbsp;In response to their question, I responded by asking this question: “When you asked the member of the Twelve the same question a year ago, what was his answer?” The response was immediate –“You will be a stake when you want to be a stake.” They then said that they did not fully understand the response. Of course they wanted to be a stake – they had wanted it for years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My response was then the same as had been given by the member of the Twelve a year earlier, with one clarification. “You will become a stake when you want to be a stake enough that you are willing to do the work that is needed to become a stake.” As you may know, in order to become a stake, there must be a certain number of members, and they must have a certain level of faithfulness in paying their tithing, and so forth. The things that they were lacking when I visited a few months ago were the very things that they were lacking a year earlier when a member of the Twelve had visited. In the year that had passed, they had lived good lives and had done much good. But they had not focused on the work needed to reactivate a relatively few members, or to invite a relatively few to receive the blessings of being full tithe payers or the work needed to invite a few more of their friends and family to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ. In other words, their desire to become a stake had not been strong enough to motivate them to do the things that they needed to do to become a stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we are about 4 months from that visit. During those months, the district leadership, the branch presidents, the missionary force and others went to work to do the things needed to become a stake. I am pleased to report that within a very short period of time – certainly this year – there will be an additional stake in the Asia Area. This is because they came to understand that “desire” in the gospel of Jesus Christ always and must always include the action and work needed to accomplish whatever is desired. Remember, we show our desire to God by what we do, far more than by what we say.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can give another example from the experiences of missionaries around the world. Many of you have served, for which we are so very grateful. As President Monson has said,</p>
<p>“We affirm that missionary work is a priesthood duty—and we encourage all young men who are worthy and who are physically able and mentally capable to respond to the call to serve. Many young women also serve, but they are not under the same mandate to serve as are the young men. We assure the young sisters of the Church, however, that they make a valuable contribution as missionaries, and we welcome their service.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Sisters, if you have not yet served, but have a desire to do so, ask the Lord whether it would be pleasing to Him for you to serve. Brethren, if you have not yet served and are physically and emotionally able, please be worthy, or become worthy, and step up to your duty to do whatever is needed to receive a call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Evans and I served together as I presided over the Japan Nagoya Mission. Our desire was to increase the quantity and quality of convert baptisms and to more firmly establish the Lord’s church in Japan. As many of you know, in recent months, Elder Oaks has reminded us that the very doctrinal purpose of missionary work is to “teach repentance and baptize converts.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup> That is what we wanted to do! That was the desire of our hearts. We set goals and made plans on how to accomplish those goals. We worked with greater focus and desire than we had ever done in anything in our lives. As we worked with missionaries, we were blessed and the work increased. We found more opportunities to teach repentance and then saw the blessing of an increase in the number of convert baptisms. However, after experiencing this remarkable blessing, we then experienced a period where we plateaued and we stopped reaching our goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever felt this way in those things that you want to achieve? As I contemplated what to do, one of our missionaries wrote to me a letter in which he said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am really thinking about what I can do to [achieve our goals]...I know that it will require more dedication than I have had to accomplish these goals. I think so many times when we have missed our goals, it came down to the sad fact that we just didn’t care. Of course we wanted baptisms, but we didn’t really care enough to do the things that make baptisms happen. It is sad, but when we all really think seriously about it, we all know it is true.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught this principle in these words. He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Desire denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more than passive preferences or fleeting feelings... Therefore what we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>This gospel principle was first taught to me in my patriarchal blessing. After calling me by name and declaring my lineage, the beloved patriarch then pronounced a personal and guiding blessing on me from Heavenly Father. At the end my blessing, the patriarch then said, “These blessings are yours, dear brother, if you live for them and work for them.”I have come to rejoice in this blessing. I have come to understand that my Heavenly Father, who loves me, gave me the moral agency and freedom to choose to live for and work for those blessings which He has already prepared. &nbsp;I came to understand that I would largely determine what kind of life I would have. Through my choices and my actions, I would choose whether or not I would follow the Father’s will and receive the blessings that He had already determined to give me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer taught this doctrine of moral agency, choice and obedience this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Obedience-- --[God] will accept when freely given. And he will then return to you freedom that you can hardly dream of--the freedom to feel and to know, the freedom to do, and the freedom to be, at least a thousandfold more than we offer him. Strangely enough, the key to freedom is obedience.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Mary and I &nbsp;have found the same thing. As we have chosen to be obedient to the will of our Heavenly Father, He has given to us and to our family blessings that we could never have imagined. In giving God our agency and in choosing to follow His will, we have found that rather than feeling constrained by this choice, we have experienced real freedom. This freedom all that our Heavenly Father desires us to feel, to understand, to do and to become. Each righteous choice to follow the Father’s will deepens our discipleship and, ultimately, leads us to the gift of eternal life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need the Lord’s help and the guidance of His Spirit to make the right choices as you consider the big decisions of your life:&nbsp;</p>
<p>What will I study? When will I serve my mission? What will I do for a living? Who will I marry? When should we start a family? How many children should we have? Where will my family live? Who will I become? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your greatest happiness and spiritual security will come as you love and trust God enough that you will willingly give your agency to Him and say, “I will do as you direct.” Understanding our Father’s will and choosing to follow His will is the great test of our lives. Any other path will bring you less of everything that is truly important. I add my witness that when you are ready to make this commitment and remain faithful to it, you will find happiness – even joy – spiritual safety for you and your family, as well as “the freedom to feel and to know, the freedom to do, and the freedom to be, at least a thousandfold more than we offer him.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I close with a recent, personal experience. Not long ago, Mary and I knelt by our bed to say our evening prayer. It was my turn to say the prayer, and I began by praying for many of the same things that we've always prayed for. &nbsp;We prayed for President Monson, his counselors and the Twelve. We prayed for our missionaries and for other missionaries, for our children and for our grandchildren, and for ourselves. Then an unusual spirit came upon us and I said, “Heavenly Father, all that is left in our lives is to do whatsoever Thou would have us do and to work to bring the blessings of the gospel more strongly into the lives of our children, our grandchildren and, if Thou allows it, our great grandchildren.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>After so many experiences together, Mary and I have come to that place where we are willing, absolutely willing, to fully surrender to our Heavenly Father’s will, not because of force or fear of consequence, but because of our love for Him, and our gratitude for His Son, and our complete confidence in Him as our Father, who loves us. We know that He sees farther than we do. We know that He can provide for us and others in ways we cannot understand. We know that as we follow His will, even when we do not fully understand why, and even when it is contrary to something that we have planned or even worked toward, He will bless us in ways we cannot now even imagine. &nbsp;How we love Him and His Son. How we trust them. How grateful we are for His blessings, and especially those blessings which have required work, faith and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My prayer is that each of us will consider our own desire to follow the Father’s will in our lives. Doing so will take much more than simply keeping the commandments. It will take sacrifice and even consecration. It will take a firm commitment to doing those things that are consistent with His will. It will take a lot of work, and it will take some sacrifice, but it will be worth it. May you find the faith and the courage to find out what God really desires of you, and may each of us have the faith and courage to do those things that are necessary to do His will, and accomplish His purposes, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>14 March 2017<br />David T. Warner<br />Area Seventy, Utah Salt Lake Area<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Sister Warner]</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, with all the “ha” in my heart, and with the “ha” I feel in this room, I offer you my sincerest “aloha.”</p>
<p>“Ha” has been a recurring theme and sustaining force in our lives since our first introduction to this beautiful place called La’ie in 2006. That’s when David was first asked to support the PCC cultural leaders in preparing a new night show, “HA: Breath of Life.” From our first visit, the spirit that we felt has not only lingered, but intensified. We love you.</p>
<p>We feel we have been prepared to be here today. David served his mission in Taiwan, I spent two years of my youth living in Hong Kong. Our son Matthew served his mission in Singapore and Malaysia. David and I visited Cambodia, and Beijing for work a few years ago, and my grandfather served his mission in Japan. So you can see that being here with you today is a culmination of family experiences with the people of the “Isles of the Sea” spanning more than a century. Perhaps that is why we feel your collective “ha” so deeply.</p>
<p>Thank you, President and Sister Tanner, for inviting us to be here with you today.</p>
<p>A few years ago, after a particularly discouraging day, I was returning home in the dark from my walk and noticed two people approaching our front door. It was President and Sister Tanner. In her hands Sister Tanner held a warm loaf of homemade bread. I knew she had had a busy day, and yet here she was at our door with an offering that was not only delicious to eat but the gesture of service was nourishing to our souls. Now I am in no way obligating President and Sister Tanner to appear at your apartments with a warm loaf of bread, but I am commending them to you as servants of The Bread of Life who will feed you with his good word and nourish you with his love.</p>
<p>Now for a brief introduction of my husband and eternal companion, David. He has been a faculty member at BYU-Provo, a staff administrator at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City, and now is a founding partner of a private technology company. He has led small teams and large projects involving hundreds of people. I could catalog his various achievements, but I’d rather give you a glimpse of the person he truly is. Over the years he has received notes and letters from people he has served and led. Let me share just a few expressions of their appreciation:</p>
<p>One person wrote: “David, you have imbued and fostered an environment of mutual love and respect...that I’ve never seen equaled.”</p>
<p>Another said, “The thing I...treasure most is [your] deeply personal interest in who I am as a person, and [your] unfailing concern for my growth and development.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>From another: “[You have] a kindness in [your] character that makes everyone feel welcome...[You help] those around [you] to know that they have a valuable contribution to make.”</p>
<p>And finally, “You have constantly encouraged and reassured me. Thank you for teaching by word and example what it means to follow the Master. When I think about the disciple I’m trying to become, I think of you.”</p>
<p>That’s a little window into who David also is to me and our two sons Peter and Matthew, and we love him very much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One side note: On the mainland David often interacts with people in formal situations. But here in La’ie, perhaps because of the island breezes, the flip flops, and the aloha spirit that makes everyone family, his friends have taken to calling him “Dave,” which brings a smile to our lips and a warmth to our hearts and endears each of you to us in a most special way.</p>
<p>Today I bear my testimony that we are all Heavenly Father’s children, that He has sent His son Jesus Christ to redeem us and make it possible for us to live with him again. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Elder Warner]</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha! Allison and I are delighted to be here with you this morning. Amartuvshiin and Audrey, thank you for your prayer and scripture, and Mai, thanks in advance, for your prayer at the end of the meeting. And our dear cousins from the PCC, thank you for singing from your hearts, and to Brother Muti, for accompanying. We love that Primary song. You know, when prophets prophesied about the significance of this place, they were also prophesying about you and all the students who study here. Just by learning and living the gospel at BYU–Hawaii, you are truly helping “to bring the world His truth.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A couple of months ago I asked a few students here to tell me what makes a good devotional. I was intrigued by what they said: First, “tell stories.” Second, “show us that you are real.” And third, “talk about something that matters to us.” President and Sister Tanner’s message last week did all of those things, and was so inspiring. Allison and I hope you will re-read their message entitled “Three Ships” and refer to it often throughout your journey here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning, I’d like to explore with you the topic of learning. But, let me quickly add, not the kind of learning you might be thinking of. I’m talking about the learning that encompasses all of life—the adventure of discovering why we came to the earth, who we are, and what Heavenly Father wants us to understand and become.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think, for a moment, about the people in scripture who have a burning desire to learn. We open the Book of Mormon and meet Nephi, who “desires to know the mysteries of God.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;Enos says, “My soul hungered.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;And Alma leaves behind everything to learn and teach the gospel he received from Abinadi.<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;Throughout the scriptures and Church history, we find the Savior’s prophets and disciples seeking to learn. And you have come to BYU–Hawaii for that very purpose.</p>
<p>But here’s something to think about: have you noticed that we can choose to see “assigned” learning—like homework, research papers, and exams—in a way that diminishes our desire to learn? That’s not a criticism of schoolwork. But in our natural-man sort of way we can let the wonder of discovery get buried beneath the weight of deadlines and grades and graduation requirements. And if we’re not careful, we may even forget that we chose to come to school in the first place! That’s when we find ourselves gazing out at the blue sky beyond our classroom window, tempted to turn off our brains and just run away. And a temptation like that must be especially hard to resist when you’re going to school in this paradise called La’ie.</p>
<p>But giving into such temptations—giving up on the kind of learning we’re talking about—would be a tragedy. We came to earth to learn. And if we choose to trade learning for mindless distractions and fleeting pleasures, a part of us dies. Because learning is like breathing. And if we ever stop doing it deeply and continually, we can lose the strength and ability to do it at all.</p>
<p>The Lord has said it is expedient—meaning it is necessary—for us to “understand...things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; ...and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a sweeping course of study! And why is such broad learning necessary? The Lord explains it is all about you: “That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If being prepared for the mission of your life is what you desire, you are in the right place! Being a student at BYU–Hawaii is a blessing given to you by your Heavenly Father and you are here for a purpose. What your teachers are helping you learn is critically important for your future and for those whom you will bless. But learning is more than completing required assignments. Learning is what happens within you. And the decisive factor in your learning is not the quality of your teacher, the curriculum, or even your own intellectual ability. It is your desire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where learning the truth of the gospel is concerned, when you desire “with a sincere heart” and “with real intent, having faith in Christ,”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;the Holy Ghost will help you. He will testify of truth, including the all-important connection between what you learn and what it means for your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>With permission from our son Matthew, let me reconstruct a conversation we had when he was 16 years old. One evening, while driving in the car together, I asked what he was learning in seminary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh, you know,” he said in his teenage way, “the gospel.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What about the gospel?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You know, Dad, the Restoration and all that.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I see. Which part?”</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, as if weighing whether to share something that really mattered to him. “OK,” he said, “the part about Joseph Smith giving Oliver Cowdery the 126 pages from the Book of Mormon.”</p>
<p>For a moment, I wondered what kind of seminary class he was in. Then I tried to gently explain, “Well, you know son, the Prophet Joseph Smith gave those pages to Martin Harris, not Oliver Cowdery.”</p>
<p>“Sure, whatever,” Matthew said.</p>
<p>“And,” I continued, “I believe it was 116 pages, not 126.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, Dad, I know. But the point is, I made the link.”</p>
<p>“The link?” I asked.</p>
<p>Then Matthew helped me understand. “Do you remember the summer when I earned $100 mowing lawns, and I wanted to buy that electric scooter? You said you didn’t think it was a good idea. But I really wanted that scooter. So I prayed about it, and I had the feeling I should listen to you. But I didn’t like that answer, so I prayed about it again—a couple of times. And I kept getting the feeling I should forget the scooter. But I really wanted it, so I just bought it anyway. And the second day I rode it, it broke. It was too expensive to fix, and we ended up throwing it away. And I lost everything I’d saved! Dad,” he said, “ that’s what happened to Joseph Smith. He knew in his heart that he shouldn’t loan out those pages. But he kept asking the Lord, and finally Joseph loaned them anyway. And they were lost. He was totally sad and couldn’t sleep or eat or anything. And he decided he was never going to disobey again. That’s the link, Dad. That’s the link I made to myself.”</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a moment while I was making a link of my own: Learning the gospel is about more than hearing and repeating facts and concepts. Was it Oliver Cowdery or Martin Harris? It’s important to know, but not essential to salvation. The number of pages lost? That’s not a saving doctrine either. Suddenly I was thinking about good people I know who master many details of gospel doctrine and Church history, but do not make the link to what it means for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linking gospel truth to ourselves is another way of talking about truly understanding the gospel. Matthew’s new understanding was very simple: “Heavenly Father wants to help me. He won’t impose His will or insist that I obey. He will speak to me by the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost. And if I willingly listen and respond, I will be blessed and happy.”<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>In time, Matthew did learn the correct names and number of pages. And thanks to a fine seminary teacher, he identified much rich doctrine embedded in early Church History. But let’s remember, none of that would have meant much to 16-year-old Matthew until he made the link and came to an understanding for himself. That’s when he changed. And that confirms the powerful principle taught by President Boyd K. Packer: “True doctrine, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understood</span>, changes attitudes and behavior.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup> &nbsp;That’s what happened to Matthew.</p>
<p>One more insight from Matthew’s experience: when making a link is our goal, when understanding is what we’re working for, we don’t wait around for an assignment to learn. We desire it for ourselves. We hunger for it. We find ourselves “anxiously engaged”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> in learning and seek it of our “own free will,” &nbsp;acting and not being acted upon.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is liberating and life-changing to actively learn the gospel. Let me illustrate with an experience from my father’s life. When he was your age, he went to Army basic training. He had attended many Church meetings and classes throughout his youth, and he knew much information about the gospel. But he wanted to understand. He wanted to make the link.</p>
<p>So every weekend, while his buddies went out “on the town,” he took his modest stipend and rented a little motel room. Back then, a paperback copy of the Book of Mormon cost 25 cents. He bought three. One copy he read page by page, and the other two he dismantled, cutting out the verses that meant the most to him. He laid those verses on the carpet in topical clusters, starting with Adam and Eve. Over time, he began to learn the gospel for himself, by his own effort. There was a cluster of verses about the plan of salvation, which led him to think about his future education, his profession, and his contribution in the world. There was another cluster about the priesthood, and that guided his thinking about ordinances, and his future marriage and family. And at the center was the topic of greatest importance, the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ. Assembling those verses led to inspiration about repenting, forgiving, and loving God’s children. All week long he looked forward to getting back to that motel room and making links between gospel doctrine and his life. And those links helped prepare him to be the person Heavenly Father wanted him to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dad paid a price to learn the gospel for himself. He used paper and scissors. You might use digital devices. Whatever the tools, full engagement is required—heart, might, mind, and strength. Listen carefully to the words of one young man, even younger than you, who invested his whole soul to learn God’s will. He said: “My mind was called up to serious reflection. ...My feelings were deep and often poignant. ...I attended...several meetings as often as occasion would permit. ...My mind at times was greatly excited. ...I often said to myself, What is to be done?”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In time, this young man’s searching led him to a scripture about prayer. From there, he made a link. Here’s how he described it:</p>
<p>“Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again. ...At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as [the scripture] directs.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Yes, that is Joseph Smith’s description of his link to eleven words that changed this world:</p>
<p>“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>O my dear friends, think about the price 14-year-old Joseph Smith paid to prepare for his &nbsp;life’s mission! He studied. He went to meetings. He searched the scriptures for answers. He made a link! And then he woke up on his own, slipped from the little bed he shared with his siblings, put on his clothes in the half-light of morning, crawled down steep steps from the upper loft, quietly opened the latched door, and walked out into the place he had previously designed to go. No one had assigned him to go that grove of trees! No one was expecting a follow-up report! And when he returned from his vision of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, he said to his mother, “I have learned for myself.”<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your mission in life are different from Joseph Smith’s. But you are called to learn for yourself. All of us are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Now, with that foundation, let’s consider a particular area of learning—the curriculum we call adversity, or opposition, and or tribulation. In “the great school”<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup> of mortality, as Brigham Young called it, we might think of these as “required” learning, or “assigned” schoolwork, because we don’t get to choose our afflictions. But we knew that opposition would be part of Heavenly Father’s plan from the beginning. We wanted that plan! In fact, we shouted for joy at the prospect of coming to the earth to fulfill it. And we had absolute faith that whatever challenges we experienced, our Savior would faithfully perform the great sacrifice that could redeem us. As He promised His disciples, “In this world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here you are! As young adults, you have undoubtedly passed Tribulation 101. Perhaps you started with simple scrapes and bruises. Maybe you were called names on the playground. You might have been teased by siblings, and then graduated to broken promises by people you trusted. These are the ABC’s of opposition. But usually they are not enough for us to learn to fully rely upon the Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you have already begun your advanced coursework. Perhaps you were born with a disability, or were raised in a family that does not live gospel principles. You may have faced social and financial hardship, accident, injury, disease, the divorce of parents, depression, or prejudice. Some of you may be bearing heavy private burdens that only the Lord can understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be assured that through experiences like these, you are on track for the highest possible degree...the highest degree of glory! Elder Orson F. Whitney taught, “Through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, ...we gain the education that we [came to the earth] to acquire.”<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tribulation doesn’t mean that you are less worthy or less beloved of the Lord. Often, just the opposite is true. Nephi described himself as “having seen many afflictions..., nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord.”<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup> &nbsp;This is a pattern: highly favored, many afflictions. Three days before his martyrdom, the Prophet Joseph Smith said of Nauvoo, “This is the loveliest place and the best people under the heavens. Little do they know the trials that await them.”<a href="#FN19"><sup>19</sup></a> &nbsp;There’s that pattern again: good people, great trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Beloved,” the Apostle Peter said, “think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.”<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup> &nbsp;The truth is, “whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.”<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup> &nbsp;So if He is using adversity to make you chaste and pure and ready to fulfill your mission here on earth, you know he loves you deeply.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a further step. Within the curriculum we call tribulation, you have a specific learning opportunity. Some of your most fiery trials will come just because of your efforts to live the gospel. Again, let’s think of Joseph Smith. As a 17-year-old boy, Moroni told him that his “name should be had for good and evil...among all people.”<sup><a href="#FN22">22</a></sup> &nbsp;And Joseph Smith said of himself, “Envy and wrath have been my common lot all the days of my life.”<sup><a href="#FN23">23</a></sup> &nbsp;How did Joseph survive and be happy? By making the link to God’s purposes for him: “I have waded in tribulation lip-deep;” he said, “but every wave of adversity which has struck me, has wafted me that much nearer to Deity.”<sup><a href="#FN24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what does it mean for you when someone calls you out on social media? Ridicules you? Refuses to be fair with you? Rejects you? Or spreads vicious rumors about you because you stand with the Savior and His servants?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means you have the opportunity to make this most sacred link yourself: Jesus Christ was despised and rejected of men,<sup><a href="#FN25">25</a></sup> mocked, scourged, and ultimately crucified. This isn’t because he failed in some way. It is because He was the “light and life of the world,” shining forth in the darkness, even when “the darkness [comprehended] it not.”<sup><a href="#FN26">26</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>When you choose to stand with the Savior, you choose to shine with Him in a world darkened by misunderstanding, confusion, false teachings, and sin. At times, the world will not fully comprehend your light and why you believe as you do. Yet still you are called to stand as tall and bright as a city set on a hill. Our Savior knows what challenges this may bring into your lives, and He knows how to help you bear them obediently. Because of what He has done for you, He alone can offer us this most comforting assurance: “Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake...for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”<sup><a href="#FN27">27</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>With you, I express gratitude for the privilege of standing with the prophets who went before us and especially those who lead Christ’s Church today. “Ye cannot behold, with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.”<sup><a href="#FN28">28</a></sup> &nbsp;I testify that when we follow Jesus Christ and His servants the prophets, we truly can “rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is [our] reward in heaven.”<sup><a href="#FN29">29</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>There are so many links to be made! Some will occur in your classes. Others will come through learning in the temple, in sacrament meeting, in Church callings, in your apartment, at work, and in your communications with family members. In his recent BYU–Hawaii commencement address, Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught: “Our education should not be limited to formal study...learning can increase our ability to appreciate and relish the workings and beauty of the world around us.” Such learning opportunities abound here in La’ie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started coming to volunteer at the PCC, I had the idea it would be wonderful to see a sunrise from the beach. But when I parted the drapes and saw clouds, I decided to wait for another day. After a few trips I made an interesting link. When the sky is cloudless, it’s actually hard to see a sunrise. But on cloudy days, the rising sun transforms those dark, threatening shapes in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First a peach-colored wash silhouettes the emerging ink spots. Then gold begins to gild their dark edges. Suddenly, they become billowing volumes of pink, purple, sapphire, orange, and yellow. Brilliant shafts of light break through the atmospheric strife, and the whole sky is resplendent and alive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m talking about, taken on my phone two blocks away, just a month ago:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, it is necessary for me to be on time for this first class of the day, and I try to come ready to be taught by the teacher with a very still, small voice. The link I’ve made is priceless to me: We are blessed to witness the Son of God in our lives because “dark clouds of trouble [do] hang o’er us.”<sup><a href="#FN30">30</a></sup> &nbsp;As we experience affliction, hardship, and even persecution, His light not only becomes more visible, but more beautiful. And we are filled with gratitude for the cloudy days and even the treacherous storms of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Day by day, as you make such links, you will be changed. You will become the sons and daughters of Christ—spiritually “born of Him,” with “hearts...changed through faith on his name.”<sup><a href="#FN31">31</a></sup> &nbsp;And that change is the greatest gift you can give your children and our Heavenly Father’s children whom you are called to serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Brown was the custodian in charge of gym lockers at the physical education building at BYU–Provo. He never published in scholarly article. He never spoke in a devotional. He never taught a class. But because the gospel had grown in him, he taught wherever he went, through whatever he was doing. One day while cleaning out lockers he found a wallet. He opened it to learn whose it was and found a few small pictures cut out of magazines—pictures that were inappropriate for anyone to see. When the owner, a young man, came retrieve it, Brother Brown invited him to sit down for a moment. “Before I return your wallet,” Brother Brown said, “may I show you mine?” The young man nodded. Brother Brown opened his well-worn billfold. “This is a picture of my wife—my beloved companion of many years. This is my temple recommend, which makes it possible for us to be together forever. These are pictures of my children. Here are my grandchildren. My brother, I desire with all my heart that one day, you will be able to open your wallet and see what I see. I invite you to do whatever you need to do so that you can have that blessing.” Tears flowed as the young man opened his wallet, removed the pictures, and left them behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever your life’s mission may be, and whatever your current role at BYU–Hawaii, you are called “to bring the world His truth.” But Brother Brown could not have done that by merely quoting what he’d heard others say, or what he’d memorized as a full-time missionary. He had to do more than just repeat concepts and historical facts. He had to share the doctrine and principles that had grown within him as he learned and lived the gospel for himself. When we do that, the Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth that is in us. That is what this world needs. That is what your children will need to help them become lights in this world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>How we love you! As we watch you fulfilling your missions on the earth, we recognize that the world has probably changed more in your lifetime than in any other period of human history. Never have God’s children had so many tools to learn the gospel for themselves. Sadly, the availability of these tools has tempted some to resist learning from inspired teachers and leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is plenty of information for you to find. If any of you lack facts, figures, definitions, and opinions, you can Google them. With spiritual discernment and care, you can identify what is good, and you can also recognize much that the Holy Ghost directs you to deliberately ignore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if any of you lack wisdom—which is God’s knowledge and what he wants for you— ask of God. Search the scriptures. Harken to His servants the prophets. Pray.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And please embrace President Nelson’s special assignment to you, as young adults. It comes with the promise of a glorious link to your life. He said, “If you proceed to learn all you can about Jesus Christ, I promise you that your love for Him, and for God’s laws, will grow beyond what you currently imagine. ...Your ability to turn away from sin will increase. Your desire to keep the commandments will soar. You will find yourself better able to walk away from the entertainment and entanglements of those who mock the followers of Jesus Christ.”<sup><a href="#FN32">32</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, you will heed President Thomas S. Monson’s call to: “build up within [yourself] a great and powerful faith which will be [your] most effective defense against the designs of the adversary—a real faith, the kind of faith which will sustain [you] and will bolster [your] desire to choose the right.”<sup><a href="#FN33">33</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I close with one more promise from the Lord: as we learn the gospel, we must do much on our own, but we will never be alone. When the Lord described the sweeping scope of our learning, he promised, “My grace shall attend you.”<sup><a href="#FN34">34</a></sup> &nbsp;So don’t be overwhelmed by His invitation to “learn of me.”<sup><a href="#FN35">35</a></sup> &nbsp;Those words not only mean learn “about” Him, they also mean learn “from” Him. Believe in the Savior. Believe that He will help you learn through His Spirit. Know that He loves you, and He will lead you along.</p>
<p>I testify that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration. The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ and is true. President Thomas S. Monson is God’s holy prophet upon the earth. His beloved counselors, President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, are prophets, seers, and revelators, as are all the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. I rejoice to sustain them and stand with them. I bear my personal witness that our Savior Jesus Christ lives. I know for myself that He lives.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p>Brother's and Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>Today we want to share some gospel perspectives on three “ships.” These ships play an important role in our journey home to our Father in Heaven. They are friend-ship, court-ship, and physical relation-ship.</p>

<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>President Tanner and I like to think of friendship, courtship, and physical relationship as a pyramid. Friendship is the foundation of the pyramid. &nbsp;Above friendship is courtship, meaning dating and romance. And on the top of the pyramid is our physical relationship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Friendship is not only nice but necessary to our emotional and spiritual well-being. It's a principle of the gospel. Courtship and marriage should be built upon friendship. With this foundation, romance can blossom into a sweet and enduring eternal relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>An intimate physical relationship caps off the other two. Properly, it needs to be built on friendship and romantic love. &nbsp;Physical intimacy can greatly enhance the other two, but must not replace them by becoming the foundation or core of a relationship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We feel that our message today is particularly suited to you students, whether single or married, though it is a good reminder for those of us who are a bit older, too. The college years are a time to make new friends. You have so many opportunities to do so here. You are surrounded with potential friends from all over the world. What a blessing! It is also a time when you should date and court. It is a time to fall in love and marry. &nbsp;And it is a time to learn to properly express and control physical feelings of love and desire.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The world does not teach correct principles about these things—in fact, quite the opposite. &nbsp;So it is important for us to be up front and explicit about friendship, courtship, and physical relationship. These “ships” are crucial to our happiness in this life and the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><strong>FRIENDSHIP&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>So let’s begin with the first "ship", with the foundation of friendship. I like the advice that a former president of Yale gave to students. &nbsp;I offer it to you:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> "</span>I encourage you to make as many friends as possible because your education will flourish only to the extent to which you meet new people and ideas and because years from now you will look back with the greatest fondness on the people—teachers, other students, coaches, counselors, friends—you came to admire and love here."<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This advice has been true for Susan and me. &nbsp;The friends we made in college are among the fondest, dearest gifts of our BYU education. &nbsp;Susan was particularly good—and intentional—about cultivating friendships when she was a student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>When I started college, I did not know anyone. I was a little scared and lonely. &nbsp;So I set a goal to sit by new people for each meal and learn their names and something about them. &nbsp;I did this day after day until I knew every person in my group. &nbsp;I became friends with them. &nbsp;And they are dear friends still. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> It also helped her dating I must say. </span>Sister Tanner learned the ageless truth that to make friends you must be a friend. &nbsp;Or as Proverbs puts it: “A man that hath friends must show himself friendly…”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Likewise, Jesus taught that to find our life we must lose our lives.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> As you forget yourself and reach out to others, you will find new friends and a much richer life here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Let’s put this principle into practice right now. &nbsp;I invite you to look around you for someone you don’t know and introduce yourself. &nbsp;Find out who they are and then share something quick about yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Okay, go. Okay this is a great experiment. So the next challenge is that when you see this person on campus say hello and call them by name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I often say that Susan has a gift for friendship. &nbsp;She truly cares about others. &nbsp;Friendship is a gospel principle. &nbsp;In fact, Joseph Smith, who also had a gift for friendship, said that “Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of ‘Mormonism’; [it is designed ] to revolutionize and civilize the world.” &nbsp;Then he continued with this memorable comparison, I love this, he said: “Friendship is like Brother Turley in his blacksmith shop welding iron to iron; it unites the human family with its happy influence.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>How important is it to you to have this happy influence of friendship in your life? &nbsp;How does it bless your life? &nbsp;Have you ever felt friendless? &nbsp;It’s miserable to feel lonely and without friends. &nbsp;Friendship is necessary to our well-being. &nbsp;Not just nice but necessary. &nbsp;We all hunger for it; it’s a universal need.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This was brought home to me by one of my Young Women General Board members who quizzed many young women in her travels around the world. In each place, she asked them questions about their lives and compiled their answers. &nbsp;Here are some of the questions she asked, along with the most frequent response she received to each question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes you happy?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Friends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your greatest worries? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Friends.</p>
<p>What do you like to do in you free time? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Be with friends.</p>
<p>What do you spend most of your time thinking about? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Friends.</p>
<p>What do you like about Church? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Seeing my friends.</p>
<p>Why don’t’ young women come to Mutual? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>No friends.</p>
<p>Why do the young women go inactive? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Pressure of friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Isn’t that amazing! &nbsp;Friends are of paramount importance for young women all over the world. &nbsp;And I’m quite sure that young men and many adults would give similar answers. &nbsp;We all need friends.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>And we all need to be friends. That is, we need to befriend others. &nbsp;In fact, we assume the responsibility to be a friend when we covenant to follow Christ at baptism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>One of my favorite examples of that that &nbsp;I really like is the example of the people of Alma who fled from wicked King Noah to the waters of Mormon. &nbsp;There, they expressed their desire to come into the fold of God. &nbsp;Alma asked them if they were willing to bear one another’s burdens, to mourn with those that mourn, and comfort those who stand in need of comfort. &nbsp;That is, he asked them if they were willing to covenant to act as friends. &nbsp;They clapped their hands for joy to enter into such a covenant. &nbsp;And their hearts were knit together in unity and love. &nbsp;This is a great scriptural example of covenant friendship.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We can look to Jesus Christ for the greatest example of friendship. “Friend” seems to have been a tender, even sacred concept for him. It is the highest compliment he could pay his disciples, both ancient and modern. &nbsp;He said, [SLIDE 10] “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. &nbsp;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. &nbsp;Ye are my friends…Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends…”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>So friendship is an important part of college life; a necessity for our emotional well-being; and a gospel principle. &nbsp;In addition, it is the basis of strong and lasting marriages. &nbsp;Your spouse should be your best friend. You should choose your spouse from among your covenant-keeping friends who love the Lord. &nbsp;Then, as you become closer to your spouse you will also become closer to each other, as Elder Bednar has taught. &nbsp;Your covenant marriage, which you make with each other and with the Lord, will prepare you to live with two friends for eternity: The Savior and your spouse. As Latter-day Saints, we know that exaltation involves the privilege of spending eternity with our true friend, the Savior, and others who have become like him, particularly our eternal partners. &nbsp;The scriptures give us this glorious promise: “…That same sociality which exists among us here shall exist among us there, only coupled with eternal glory...”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><strong>COURTSHIP&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> I just love that scripture. </span>This brings us to the second “ship”: Courtship. &nbsp;Friendship should play a key role in courtship and marriage. &nbsp;Romantic love needs to grow out of and be infused with the qualities we associate with friendship. &nbsp;When I think of lovers, I picture them gazing into each other’s eyes. &nbsp;When I think of friends, I picture them gazing out onto the world with similar vision. &nbsp;You and your spouse need to be able to &nbsp;see life with similar eyes. &nbsp;It's important to share similar values about such matters as religion, family, child-rearing, education, politics, and so forth. &nbsp;It is good to be compatible in your sense of humor and tastes—as friends usually are. Now, you don’t have to be exactly alike, but you need to share essential values in common. &nbsp;And then you need to keep your friendship in good repair over the years. For, as one observer put it: “It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Friendship is the foundation for a lasting romance in the courtship pyramid. Let me tell you a little story to illustrate this point. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>It is the story of Isaac and Rebecca. &nbsp;Now this is not the Biblical account. &nbsp;It is about our daughter Rebecca and her suitor Isaac. &nbsp;Our Rebecca was not persuaded to marry her Isaac nearly as easily as was the Old Testament Rebekah. &nbsp;Our Becky was 21. &nbsp;She had signed up to do a summer internship through BYU in Mozambique. &nbsp;She had also started doing preliminary dental and doctor appointments for a mission application. &nbsp;Another option in her mind was applying for a master’s program in her field. &nbsp;In short she was trying to decide what to do with the next phase of her life. &nbsp;We all wondered which would win out of the 3 M’s – Mozambique, mission, or master’s degree. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> Does that sound sort of familiar? </span>Meanwhile Isaac came along in her pursuit and soon offered a choice of a fourth M - marriage. &nbsp;He was headed for medical school in a few months and he did not want to go without Becky. &nbsp;He later told us that he had his own 3 M’s that he hoped she would choose – &nbsp;marriage to me, medical school, and eventually motherhood. &nbsp;He said, “If she didn’t I knew I would be a fourth M - miserable.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Becky stood at the brink of many glamorous opportunities, and it was hard for her to set aside some of her dreams. &nbsp;(Parenthetically I would like to say that this is a pitfall for lots of young adults today. &nbsp;One project after another seems to get in the way marriage.) &nbsp;What finally won Becky over was Isaac’s intrinsic goodness and his kindness to her. &nbsp;He did the romantic things like taking her on nice dates, but this was not the most important thing to her. &nbsp;What she liked was how he put her feelings and her needs above his own. &nbsp;He did little thoughtful things, the kinds of things that one friend would do for another. Becky realized that he had the qualities that would endure through good and bad times. &nbsp;So she did marry Isaac. &nbsp;And now she reflects that she was right about his great strengths being a wonderful asset to their relationship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> So now we have our own Rebecca and Isaac in our family. </span>In the history of marriage, this is called “companionate marriage.” &nbsp;This is the idea that the purpose of marriage is not just about economics or even procreation. It's about companionship. &nbsp;That God established marriage between a man and woman, in part, so we would not be alone. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The poet John Milton was an early advocate for companionate marriage. &nbsp;In his great poem on the Fall, Paradise Lost, Milton describes Adam as feeling lonely in the Garden. &nbsp;In the Bible, God declares that “it is not good for man to be alone.” In Paradise Lost, Milton has Adam tell the Creator that it is not good for him to be alone. &nbsp;He says that I feel somehow incomplete. &nbsp;I look around and see all the animals in pairs, but I am not. &nbsp;I want someone I can converse with, someone more on my level than the animals. &nbsp;The animals just aren’t enough. &nbsp;He does not want a pet. He wants a companion. &nbsp;Milton’s God is pleased that Adam understands his need for companionship and so He creates Eve to meet this need. Adam loves her with rapturous intensity. &nbsp;He loves her beauty and her grace. &nbsp;But mostly he loves her companionship. &nbsp;She feels like the missing half of his soul. He tells an angel that he especially loves:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Those thousand decencies that daily flow</p>
<p>From all her words and actions mixt with Love</p>
<p>And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign’d</p>
<p>Union of Mind, or in us both one Soul;"<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I feel this way about Susan. In fact, I used these few lines from Paradise Lost to dedicate my book on Paradise Lost to her. &nbsp;For "those thousand decencies that daily flow" from her goodness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> Thank you. </span>In marriage there should be a union of the mind and soul, not just the body. &nbsp; Beck was attracted to Isaac not only physically, but even more for his thousand daily decencies. &nbsp;These kindnesses promised an enduring friendship and they expressed qualities of character that would last even when physical beauties eventually fade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> So you get the point. </span>Friendship, then, should form the foundation of romantic love–the love that leads to courtship and marriage. &nbsp;Likewise, friendship and romantic love, both of them, can only become what God intends them to be when they are founded on charity, the “pure love of Christ.”</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>As we learn in Moroni and Corinthians, charity is patient, long-suffering, kind, free from envy, and unselfish. &nbsp;Charity leads lovers to rejoice in truth, to believe, to hope, and to endure.<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup> This is the kind of love that we need in our marriage and you need in your romance. &nbsp;Couples whose love is based on the pure love of Christ will want the best for each other. &nbsp;They will be selfless, patient, and kind. &nbsp;These are the qualities we should seek for in courtship and in marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>One of the ways to develop a strong, loving companionship is with good communication. Communication is the way a good romantic relationship begins and also endures. &nbsp;When they were not yet married our children used to often ask me how is it that anyone ever gets together. It seemed like such a mysterious puzzle to them. &nbsp;I know that everyone’s falling-in-love story is different. But there seems to be at least one commonality among most stories. &nbsp;This is an ease and spontaneity in conversation. &nbsp;So many couples try to explain why they were attracted to each other. &nbsp;They often say things like, “we just talked and talked; I lost track of time when we were talking; it was so comfortable to talk; we share the same sense of humor; we love talking about similar interests and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>It was like that for me on my first date with John. All evening we were surrounded by myriads of people, but I felt like it was just the two of us, and we couldn’t stop talking. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I’ve heard it said that “Love is a long conversation.” &nbsp;I believe it. &nbsp;In fact I often joke with our children that if I ever run out of things to say to Dad, then our marriage will be over. &nbsp;I’m pretty safe at saying that though, because we love to talk to one another about everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> We haven't run out of things yet. </span>When we were preparing this talk, I found another version of this quote that I like a lot: &nbsp;“A happy marriage is a long conversation that always seems too short.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;I like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Communication can be fun and heady in a romantic relationship. But it is also essential to communicate prior to marriage so that you really get to know someone’s deeper self. It is not good enough to just joke around together or to speak in inch-deep generalities. &nbsp;It's particularly important on this campus of many languages and cultures that you learn to really get to know a potential spouse. &nbsp;Through wise and careful assessment of each other and through good communication you can avoid possible future heartache. &nbsp;You can know if you truly are or are not suited for each other. &nbsp;If you need help, you can seek premarital counseling with professionals and you can talk to church leaders. You should go into marriage with your eyes wide open about your own and your future spouse’s strengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Then after marriage have should have your eyes half closed. &nbsp;When there is poor communication in a relationship difficulties may arise, misunderstandings occur, and feelings may be wounded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> So to sum this up, w</span>e sometimes look for happiness in exotic places, like Mozambique, and for romance in mystique, money, or charm. We sometimes look just for looks. &nbsp;Instead, we need to look for friends who embody Christ-like character. &nbsp;As you date, seek friendships which have enduring strength and which can provide a firm foundation for a marriage. &nbsp;After you have established a solid, virtuous base in your relationship there is a place at the peak of the pyramid for physical intimacy—in marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The physical relationship between a man and a woman can be a beautiful blessing. &nbsp;However, if the physical part of romance comes too early or becomes inappropriately intimate prior to marriage, it can take over. &nbsp;It can become the tail that wags the dog in a relationship. &nbsp;This can lead to heartache, remorse, and loss of temple privileges. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Our physical emotions are powerful and exciting. &nbsp;This is how they are meant to be. &nbsp;Again they are meant to be a blessing, but this is precisely why they need to be kept in check until other fundamental parts of the relationship are developed and until after love has been sealed by marriage vows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A number of years ago we attended a regional conference of combined BYU stakes. &nbsp;President James E. Faust was one of the speakers. &nbsp;His wife, Ruth, was accompanying him, so he brought her to the pulpit by his side as he began. &nbsp;He told how she was the love of his life and how he had to work at winning her over. &nbsp;Then he said, “Our first kiss was at the marriage altar – but we’ve been making up for it ever since.” &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>That may sound like a very old-fashioned story to many of you, but in being cautious about expressing physical intimacy too soon in a relationship, we need to be a little old-fashioned. &nbsp;In our current times there seems to be no check on physical intimacy before marriage – or at any other time for that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We have taught our children some old-fashioned principles that we hope have provided robes of protection for them. &nbsp;I also used these when I counseled young single adults as a campus bishop. We tried to create some catchy phrases so they would remember them easily in times of danger and decision. &nbsp;We want to share just four principles that you can also use as guidelines when you are dating and courting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Avoid the dangers of the dark. &nbsp;Stay in well lighted places. &nbsp;Literally and figuratively. &nbsp;There’s wisdom in leaving the lights on–on the porch, in the living room, at the dance. &nbsp;And there’s safety in shunning places where you feel a darkness in spirit. Remember: &nbsp;avoid the dangers of the dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Beware the hazard of the horizontal. &nbsp;Don’t lie down together with a date. &nbsp;Just don’t do it - not to watch a movie, or to read a book, or to rest at the beach. &nbsp;There are hazards in the horizontal!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Remember the perils of privacy. &nbsp;Find public places to be alone. &nbsp;Learn even to have your intimate talks with others around you. &nbsp;There is great safety in being together where you can easily be interrupted. &nbsp;This is true for your computer and TV as well as for dating relationships. I remember that I particularly worried about young couples who would rent a house while they were still engaged. &nbsp;They wanted to spend time alone together and I would remind them to remember the perils of privacy. &nbsp;As a Bishop I had a policy called the "Ring, Ring" policy. &nbsp;When they got engaged they got a ring and I got a ring. &nbsp;This was one piece of advice that I gave them: There are perils in too much privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Modesty is a must. &nbsp;Everything about your appearance, your speech, and your demeanor should bespeak that you are a literal spirit son or daughter of Heavenly Father. If we truly understand the paramount significance of our bodies in our Father’s plan, we would show great honor for our bodies. &nbsp;When you dress and act modestly you demonstrate your understanding of this great doctrine. &nbsp;So, modesty is a must!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> Now, t</span>hese principles, most of them, are embedded in the Honor Code. &nbsp;We encourage you, we plead with you, we admonish you to live by the code of honor you promised to keep when you came here. &nbsp;Its rules and guidelines are meant to bless you. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>And apart from the value of following the sound principles embedded in the Honor Code, simply learning to keep your word is also an important preparation for marriage. &nbsp;Would you really want to marry someone who has shown that he or she either cannot or will not keep promises? This would raise questions in my mind as to whether or not I can trust the person to keep promises made to me. You prove your trustworthiness as a potential marriage partner when you keep your promises. When you break your word you erode trust and potentially sew seeds of doubt in a future spouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>You can also protect yourself from making bad choices if you choose to be with others who are also trying to make good choices. &nbsp;Someone with whom you will want to share the rest of your life will only want the very best for you. &nbsp;It says in <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">For the Strength of Youth</span>, “Choose friends who share your values so you can strengthen and encourage each other in living high standards. &nbsp;A true friend will encourage you to be your best self.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Finally, the Lord planned for us to become one in every way. &nbsp;A physical relationship can help cement our spiritual union. &nbsp;We are made for each other. &nbsp;But these powerful desires must be kept within the bounds that the Lord has set. &nbsp;As Alma taught his son Shiblon: “…bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love…”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;To bridle is not to banish but to channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Our model for marriage may be found in the very first love story. &nbsp;The Lord said that it was not good that Adam should be alone. &nbsp;So He created Eve to be “an help meet for him.” Through a misunderstanding of the archaic term “meet” the words “helpmeet” and “helpmate” have been invented and accepted into our language. &nbsp;However, the real meaning of this scripture is that Eve was created to be a “meet” help for Adam. &nbsp;“Meet” means a “fit” or “suitable help.” So Eve was tp be a special kind of helper, one who is “suited to, worthy of, or corresponding to him.” &nbsp;Both a husband and a wife should seek to be such suitable companions for each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>After learning this, Adam was taught that he and Eve should “cleave unto one another and they twain should become one flesh.” So here it is, in the first marriage are all of the elements we have been discussing today: The scriptures first emphasize that God made a help meet for Adam, emphasizing their companionable relationship. &nbsp;Then they mention that the Lord authorizes the physical relationship: “they shall be one flesh.” &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This is a marriage built to last, for it is built on our pyramid &nbsp;of friendship, courtship, and physical relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Speaking of a marriage meant to last, let me just share some tender remarks made by President Hinckley about Sister Hinckley near the end of their lives. &nbsp;He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"May I be personal for a moment? &nbsp;I sat at dinner across the table from my wife the other evening. &nbsp;It was fifty-five years ago that we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. &nbsp;The wondrous aura of young womanhood was upon her. &nbsp;She was beautiful, and I was bewitched. &nbsp;Now, for more than half a century, we have walked together through much of storm as well as sunshine. &nbsp;Today neither of us stands as tall as we once did. &nbsp;As I looked at her across the table, I noted a few wrinkles in her face and hands. &nbsp;But are they less beautiful than before? No, in fact, they are more so. &nbsp;Those wrinkles have a beauty of their own, and inherent in their very presence is something that speaks reassuringly of strength and integrity and a love that runs more deeply and quietly than ever before."<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Now this is an example of lasting love! When you marry, don’t marry for looks, wealth, or any other fading quality. &nbsp;Look for someone who will “wear well” as we like to say in my family. &nbsp;Look for a marriage that will last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>To me, President’s Hinckley’s tribute to his wife sounds like the epitome of sanctified, fulfilling friendship and love. &nbsp;I know what it is to have such a friend. &nbsp;I love John for his “thousand decencies that daily flow from all [his] words and actions mixt with Love” in our relationship. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>He was kind and thoughtful and romantic in our courtship. &nbsp;This continued even when he was going to school full time, working full time and we had three children under the age of four. He has shown this by helping me in my busy roles, bathing the little children every night, scrubbing the kitchen floor, and being my window to the world – keeping me abreast to what was happening out there. &nbsp;Through the years he supported the children in plays, concerts, athletic events, and papers to write. &nbsp;He would give me moments of reprieve – for a walk or a weekend getaway or a trip to the temple. &nbsp;In my more-than-full time assignment as Young Women President, he was solicitous and loving. &nbsp;When I came home tired at night he made cheese toast (and other such delicacies), so I didn’t have to cook. &nbsp;He was my muse and my editor in my writing and talks. &nbsp;He prayed for me and gave me priesthood blessings. &nbsp;He was a “meet” help or a help suited for me in every way. &nbsp;I would like to pay tribute to him with this favorite 17th Century love poem by Anne Bradstreet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To My Dear and Loving Husband”</p>
<p>If ever two were one, then surely we. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If ever wife was happy in a man,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare with me, ye women, if you can.</p>
<p>I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold.</p>
<p>Or all the riches that the East doth hold.</p>
<p>My love is such that rivers cannot quench,</p>
<p>Nor ought but love from thee, give recompense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thy love is such I can no way repay,</p>
<p>The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.</p>
<p>Then while we live, in love let’s so persevere</p>
<p>That when we live no more, we may live ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Thank you, that is so sweet! &nbsp;I too pray that we can so persevere that we can live together forever! I want to just reciprocate by quoting from a poem that Susan knows well. I first quoted these lines to Susan when we were dating. &nbsp;It was on her doorstep during a surprise visit to her apartment. &nbsp;She had just washed her hair and was a little embarrassed to have to greet me with hair dripping wet and no make-up. &nbsp; But, as she opened the door I said, quoting Shakespeare’s Sonnet 116:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</p>
<p>Admit impediments. Love is not love</p>
<p>Which alters when it alteration finds,</p>
<p>Or bends with the remover to remove:</p>
<p>O no; it is an ever-fixed mark,&nbsp;</p>
<p>That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;</p>
<p>It is the star to every wandering bark,</p>
<p>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Ours has been a marriage of true minds--grounded on friendship, which blossomed into romance, and was capped by physical love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>It is our earnest prayer that you, too, will find joy in your lives through our covenant relationships with friends, family, and God as we have in ours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[President Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We pray that you will make deep friendships, friendships built on Christ-like virtues. From among such friends, may you find one whom you will want to court and with whom you will build a happy marriage. &nbsp;And in your covenant marriage, may you find an even deeper, eternal friendship, sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise and Temple covenants and then crowned with a sacred and joyful special closeness that comes from a sanctified physical relationship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Sister Tanner]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>That we all may find joy in the holy socialities that the Lord has provided for us, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
