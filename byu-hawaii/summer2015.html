<p>June 9, 2015<br />Elder Lawrence R. Flake <br />Professor of Church History and Doctrine (BYU Provo) and Missionary (BYU-Hawaii)<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>It is a joy to address you this beautiful morning in Paradise. Many of you attended the devotional a few months ago when my cousin, United States Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, was the speaker. He did an excellent job, but I was quite surprised a few weeks later when President Wheelwright invited me to also give a devotional address. I asked the president if he was sure he really wanted to have two "Flakes" speak the same year. If you count the senator's wife and mine, who introduced their husbands, you actually have four "flaky" speakers.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for Sister Flake's introduction. I wish I could introduce her to you. That would take the rest of the hour, but I can assure you it would be time well spent. I will just mention one thing about Elaine that indicates what kind of a trouper she is. She and I took a little longer than we wanted finding each other after our missions. When we finally did get married, we worried that we might not have enough time to have as many children as we had hoped for. But just ten years later, when we were called to preside over the Missouri Independence Mission, we already had five of our children—but we were both getting older. So, during the next three years, while we served in Missouri, Sister Flake gave birth to three more babies—one each year we were there, giving us our eight great children—and she never missed attending a single zone conference!</p>
<p>I loved hearing you sing, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/come-come-ye-saints?lang=eng" target="_blank">Come, Come, Ye Saints</a>.” It is one of our most cherished hymns not only because of its pleasing music, or even its poignant words, but because of the<strong> </strong>feelings it evokes as we reflect on the nobility and courage of the first and second generations of valiant Latter-day Saint pioneers, who laid the foundation of this mighty kingdom. Some of us are direct descendants of those remarkable stalwarts. Like many other pioneers, my and senator Flake's great grandfather, William Jordan Flake, faithfully answered the call of President Brigham Young to leave his comfortable home in Beaver, Utah, and lead a colonization effort into the wilderness of northern Arizona Territory. One of the towns our great grandfather established there in partnership with Apostle Erastus Snow was named in honor of both of its founders—Snow Flake, Arizona. I’m told that the town of Snowflake once had a mayor named Jack Frost. When he told people he was Jack Frost from Snowflake Arizona&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . .</p>
<p>As Senator Flake mentioned, over the years we Flakes have taken a lot of “flack” because of the name <em>Flake</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>One of our six missionary sons found it hard enough being known as Elder Flake, but things got even worse when he was assigned a companion named Elder Looney! People really had to be honest in heart to accept the gospel from Elder Flake and Elder Looney!</p>
<p>Another name that means a great deal to us is the honorable name of Cannon. As you know this wonderful building we are meeting in today is named for the great George Q. Cannon. He was one of the first missionaries called to the Sandwich Islands, now known as the Hawaiian Islands. He later served as an apostle for more than forty years, and as a counselor to four presidents of the Church. Had he lived six months longer, he would likely have become the sixth president of the Church. When he died, the Boston Globe newspaper ranked him as the third most powerful Mormon, right behind Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.</p>
<p>Many years ago Sister Flake and I wrote a book detailing the five missions Elder Cannon served back-to-back over a fifteen-year period while still a young man. The second of these missions brought him to Hawaii 165 years ago. We fell in love with George Q. Cannon!&nbsp; As it happened, we were expecting a baby at the time we were getting well acquainted with Elder Cannon. When our little boy was born, we gave him the noble name Cannon William Flake. As you might imagine, Cannon got quite a few comments on his unusual first name. On one occasion someone asked his four-year-old sister, "Where did your brother get his name Cannon?" She proudly responded, "From George Q.—Washington!"</p>
<p>It is a wonderful blessing for me to have been raised hearing inspiring stories of valiant pioneer ancestors on both sides of my family. Not all of these stories were of major trials and tribulations. Sometimes they concerned funny little incidents from everyday life.</p>
<p>I remember my father telling of one of my pioneer ancestors confessing his folly. He was leading two rather large calves with ropes around each of their necks. He held the ropes, one in each of his hands. When he came to a gate, he needed both hands free to open it. Not wanting to let the calves escape, he had the bright idea of tying one rope around each of his legs. In his journal that night, he describes the resulting disaster: “Those calves had not dragged me 100 feet before I realized what I had done wrong.”</p>
<p>The scripture that was used to introduce today's devotional theme comes from a faith-promoting Book of Mormon story concerning Nephi's steadfast younger brother, Jacob. He was confronted by a charismatic, smooth-talking, devil-inspired anti-Christ named Sherem. Sherem tried in every way possible to shake Jacob's testimony and commitment to God's Kingdom. Without going into the details of their dramatic encounter, let me just emphasize Jacob's powerful words as he reports Sherem's utter failure in that endeavor:</p>
<p>"…he had hope to shake me from the faith . . . [but] <strong>I could not be shaken.</strong>" [emphasis added] (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Jacob 7:5</a>)</p>
<p>I pray that what I say today will help each of us be able to proclaim with that same fervor, "<strong>I cannot be shaken</strong>."&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young man, shortly after returning from my mission to New York, I had the opportunity of traveling in chartered busses to Palmyra with 150 wonderful young women from BYU Provo and other Utah schools. These young ladies served as special missionaries to help put on the spectacular Hill Cumorah Pageant. On our return trip across the United States we visited several Church history sites along the old Mormon pioneer trail. One of these sites was the historic Mormon cemetery at Winter Quarters near Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>As the girls and I walked quietly up the hill containing the graves of many Saints who died there, our spirits were subdued. Located at the top of the hill is that impressive Avard Fairbanks monument with which you are no doubt familiar. It is a statue of a pioneer mother and father, a shovel in his hand, standing before the open grave of their baby. At the base of the monument embossed in bronze are listed the names of most of the 600 pioneers buried there. Those 600 graves are just a tithing of the 6,000 graves of other courageous Saints who lie along the rest of the trail to the Salt Lake Valley. Without a cue or suggestion from anyone, the girls spontaneously began to sing "<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/come-come-ye-saints?lang=eng" target="_blank">Come, Come, Ye Saints</a>."</p>
<p>At first their singing was very strong and resolute, but as the words and the spirit of that stirring hymn sank deeper into their hearts, their singing turned more into sobbing. By the last verse I think I was the only one still singing. As I voiced the words “And should we die before our journey’s through,” I was scanning the alphabetical list of names on the bronze plaque. In the ‘F’s, two names caught my attention—Samuel Flake, age five months, and Frederick Flake, age one day. Then I stopped singing, too. Despite unfathomable hardships, the pioneers' faith<strong> could not be shaken</strong>.</p>
<p>Another family with multiple names engraved on the monument is that of Stillman Pond. President James E. Faust details their sacrifice in these words:</p>
<p>“Like others, he and his wife, Maria, and their children were harassed and driven out of Nauvoo. In September 1846, they became part of the great western migration. The early winter that year brought extreme hardships, including malaria, cholera, and consumption. The&nbsp;family&nbsp;was visited by all three of these diseases.</p>
<p>Maria contracted consumption, and all of the children were stricken with malaria. Three of the children died while moving through the early snows. Stillman buried them on the plains. Maria’s condition worsened because of the grief, pain, and the fever of malaria. She could no longer walk. Weakened and sickly, she gave birth to twins. They were named Joseph and Hyrum, and both died within a few days.</p>
<p>The Stillman Pond family arrived at Winter Quarters and, like many other families, they suffered bitterly while living in a tent. The death of the five children coming across the plains to Winter Quarters was but a beginning…</p>
<p>&nbsp;‘On Wednesday, the 2nd of December 1846, Laura Jane Pond, age 14 years, … died of chills and fever.’ Two days later on ‘Friday, the 4th of December 1846, Harriet M. Pond, age 11 years, … died with chills.’ Three days later, ‘Monday, the 7th of December, 1846, Abigail A. Pond, age 18 years, … died with chills.’ Just five weeks later, ‘Friday, the 15th of January, 1847, Lyman Pond, age 6 years, … died with chills and fever. Four months later, on the 17th of May, 1847, his wife Maria Davis Pond also died. Crossing the plains, Stillman Pond lost nine children and a wife. He became an outstanding colonizer in Utah, and became the senior president of the thirty-fifth Quorum of Seventy. (See Leon Y. and H. Ray Pond, comps., “Stillman Pond, a Biographical Sketch,” in&nbsp;<em>Sterling Forsyth Histories,</em>&nbsp;typescript, Church Historical Dept. Archives, pp. 4–5.)</p>
<p>Having lost these nine children and his wife in crossing the plains, Stillman Pond did not lose his faith. He did not quit.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire?lang=eng" target="_blank">James E. Faust, "The Refiner's Fire,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign,&nbsp;</em>May, 1979</a>)</p>
<p><strong>He could not be shaken</strong>.</p>
<p>As the Church continues to expand, especially in foreign lands, the percentage of members who are actual literal descendants of the original pioneers decreases, but I believe that all&nbsp;those who bind themselves to this monumental work that the pioneers began, are somehow spiritually adopted into that remarkable heritage and become descendants of those noble forebears. This very real bond was touchingly displayed for me once when I listened to one of my students, with tears running down his cheeks, express love and gratitude for his heroic pioneer ancestors who crossed the plains. This would not have been so unusual except that his name was Dugarasue Sakaguchi, and he was a Japanese convert to the Church. In a very real way, I believe Brother Sakaguchi is just as much a descendent of the pioneers as I am.</p>
<p>All of you are also descendants whether literal or adopted of great latter-day pioneers—pioneers of the Pacific Islands, pioneers of Asia, pioneers of New Zealand, the Philippines, Australia, and many other places around the world where the pioneering is still going on.</p>
<p>Many years ago, a non-Mormon scholar, told an interesting story on the BYU campus in Provo. It deeply impressed me with the strong connection between the first and second generations of pioneers and the present generation of young people and converts in the Church.</p>
<p>Before World War II, the respected musician Bruno Walter was the conductor of the famous Vienna Symphony Orchestra. This symphony was a unique musical organization with a spirit and unity and synergism that produced glorious music, powerful and unmatched by any other symphony.</p>
<p>When the Nazis took over Austria, the conductor fled to America. It was not until 1947 that he was finally able to return to Austria. Upon his return, his first priority was to visit his treasured Vienna Symphony.</p>
<p>As he approached the concert hall where they were rehearsing, he could hear the strains of their glorious music. Mr. Walter said that if he had been anywhere on the face of the earth and had heard that magnificent sound, he would have been able to identify it as coming only from his beloved Vienna Symphony. When he entered the concert hall, to his amazement, he discovered that although the exquisite musical quality was still there, not a single one of the musicians playing with the symphony then had played with it before the war, when he was its conductor. All of them were new, but the quality and powerful spirit of that remarkable orchestra remained unaltered.</p>
<p>All of the first and second generations of the Mormon pioneers are gone. Our challenge is to keep alive that valiant spirit of sacrifice and courage that characterized their lives and service.</p>
<p>In a couple of weeks, we will mark the 171st anniversary of the assassination of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum. As I reflect on that tragic event, my mind is drawn to a copy of a newspaper clipping I have in my file containing an interesting, though somewhat garbled, account of the martyrdom&nbsp; reported two weeks after the fact in the&nbsp;<em>New York Weekly Herald.&nbsp;</em>The headline reads: “Important News from Nauvoo: Death of Joe and Hyrum Smith: Terrible Excitement in the West.” In part the article said, “We yesterday received by western mail the following particulars of the death of Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother Hyrum. They were both shot. There was tremendous excitement in the west in consequence of their death” The article continued and then ended with this three-word conclusion and prediction: <strong>“</strong>Thus ends Mormonism.” (Thomas Ford. "<a href="http://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/19CMNI/id/13232" target="_blank">19th Century Mormon Article Newspaper Index</a>."&nbsp;<em>Weekly Herald</em>&nbsp;[New York, New York] 13 July 1844, 9.28th ed.: n. pag.&nbsp;<em>Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University</em>. By Jason Bosen. Provo: Harold B. Lee Library Brigham Young U, 2011. 220-21.)</p>
<p>This newspaper was not alone in that gloomy forecast. Many observers, both friendly and antagonistic, believed that with the death of its dynamic leader, the church Joseph founded would go the way of numerous other flash-in-the-pan religious movements of the time. That prognostication likely would have come to pass had Joseph Smith in fact been the founder of the Church, but he was not.</p>
<p>I bear my witness, with yours, that the establishment of this Church in the latter days is the very fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy that in the last days:</p>
<p>“shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/2.44?lang=eng#43" target="_blank">Daniel 2:44</a>)</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord proclaims the fulfillment of that marvelous prophecy,</p>
<p>“The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">D&amp;C 65:2</a>)</p>
<p>Expectations that the Church would disintegrate had been voiced frequently before the Martyrdom and have been heard many times since. Even now, anti-Mormon writers engage in wishful thinking as they see what they believe are the foundations of Zion crumbling. When the authors of a book critical of the Church concluded, “The future of the Church is dim,” President Gordon B. Hinckley responded with his characteristic politeness:</p>
<p>"Without wishing to seem impertinent, I should like to ask what they know about that future. They know nothing of the prophetic mission of this Church. The future must have looked extremely dim in the 1830s. It must have looked impossible back in those Ohio-Missouri days. But notwithstanding poverty, notwithstanding robbing, notwithstanding murders, notwithstanding confiscation and drivings and disfranchisement forced upon the Saints, the work moved steadily on. It has continued to go forward. Never<strong> </strong>before has it been so strong. Never before has it been so widespread. Never before have there been so many in whose hearts has burned an unquenchable [<strong>unshakeable</strong>] knowledge of the truth." (“Counsel to Religious Educators,” September 14, 1984, p. 7, Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)</p>
<p>May I share with you three short stories that may or may not be connected to each other but that underscore this theme of maintaining the continuity of the pioneer spirit by <strong>not being shaken</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1900, Thomas Yates, a Mormon student attending Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, had an interesting conversation with the cofounder of that institution, Andrew Dixon White. Dr. White had served as United States foreign minister in Russia several years earlier. He told Brother Yates of a visit he had had with the famous Count Leo Tolstoy.</p>
<p>Tolstoy, as you may know, is considered by many to be the greatest Russian philosopher, social critic, and novelist of all time. His best-known work, the very long classic, <em>War and Peace. </em>It has been read and viewed in movie form by millions the world over. The Russian movie version of it is<strong> </strong>six-and-a-half hours long. The film was so long, I’m told, they charged three different admission prices: one for those under twelve, one for those over twelve, and one for those who turned twelve during the movie! (I don’t know if that’s really true or not.)</p>
<p>According to Brother Yates’ recollection of what Dr. White told him concerning the exchange with Tolstoy, the renowned Russian scholar asked Dr. White to tell him about the American religion. Puzzled, Dr. White explained that we don’t&nbsp;<em>have&nbsp;</em>an American religion, “that each person is free to belong to the particular church in which he is interested.” Tolstoy is reported to have shown a little impatience in replying:</p>
<p>"I know<strong> </strong>all of this. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the Church to which I refer originated in America, and is commonly known as the Mormon Church. What can you tell me of the teachings of the Mormons?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Well," said Dr. White, “I know very little concerning them”</p>
<p>"Then Count Leo Tolstoi .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rebuked the ambassador. 'Dr. White, I am greatly surprised and disappointed that a man of your great learning and position should be so ignorant on this important subject. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the people follow the teachings of this Church, nothing can stop their progress—it will be limitless. There have been great movements started in the past but they have died or been modified before they reached maturity.'</p>
<p>And then, according to Yates via White, Tolstoy made this remarkable prediction:</p>
<p>“If<strong> </strong>Mormonism is able to endure, unmodified, until it reaches the third and fourth generation, it is destined to become the greatest power the world has ever known.”<em> </em>(Thomas J. Yates, “Count Tolstoi and the ‘American Religion.’” <em>Improvement Era</em>, February 1939, as quoted by David B. Haight: "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1980/04/he-is-not-here-he-is-risen?lang=eng" target="_blank">He is Not Here, He Is Risen</a>", General Conference April 1980)</p>
<p>While some have questioned the accuracy of both White’s and Yates’ memories of this exchange, it is clear that Tolstoy had an interest in Mormonism and referred to it in his journal, in print, and in conversation. One of Brigham Young’s daughters, Susa Young Gates, corresponded with the count and sent him several books and pamphlets, including the Book of Mormon and The Life of Joseph Smith by George Q. Cannon. It is also clear that this bold prediction attributed to Tolstoy found its way into the speaking and writing of the Church in the early part of the 20th century.</p>
<p>After graduating from Cornell University in 1902, Brother Yates returned to Utah, where he apparently shared the Tolstoy prophecy with various interested members of the Church, possibly including the President of the Church, Joseph F. Smith.</p>
<p>The second story which, as I said, may or may not be related to the first, is told by President Spencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, in his October 1969 General Conference address:</p>
<p>"When I was a youngster, a stirring challenge came to me that moved me not a little I cannot remember who issued the challenge nor under what circumstances it came. I remember only that it struck me like a 'bolt out of the blue heavens.' The unknown voice postulated:</p>
<p>'The ‘Mormon Church’ has stood its ground for the first two generations—but wait till the third and fourth and succeeding generations come along! The first generation fired with a new religion developed a great enthusiasm for it. Surrounded with bitterness, calumnee of a hostile world, persecuted ‘from pillar to post,’ they were forced to huddle together for survival. There was good reason to expect they would live and die faithful to their espoused cause.</p>
<p>The second generation came along born to enthusiasts, zealots, devotees. They were born to men and women who had developed great faith, were inured to hardships and sacrifices for their faith. They inherited from their parents and soaked up from religious homes the stuff of which the faithful are made. They had full reservoirs of strength and faith upon which to draw.</p>
<p>But wait till the third and fourth generations come along,' said the cynical voice. 'The fire will have gone out—the devotion will have been diluted—the sacrifice will have been nullified—the world will have hovered over them and surrounded them and eroded them—the faith will have been expended and the religious fervor leaked out.'"</p>
<p>Then President Kimball declared.</p>
<p>"That day I realized that<strong> </strong>I was a member of the third generation. That day I clenched my growing fists. I gritted my teeth and made a firm commitment to myself that here was one 'third generation' who would not fulfill that dire prediction."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young Spencer Kimball "<strong>could not be shaken</strong>."</p>
<p>The third story may identify the source of the "unknown voice" that spoke to young Spencer Kimball of the dangers of the third and fourth generations losing the faith of their pioneer fathers and mothers.</p>
<p>Sometime in 1904 or 1905, when Spencer Kimball would have been nine or ten years old, the president of the Church, Joseph F. Smith, gave a powerful address in General Conference entitled “The Third and Fourth Generations.” It is possible that this is where young Spencer heard the challenge that he said moved him “not a little.”</p>
<p>Another person who was deeply moved by President Smith’s stirring address was Professor Evan Stephens.</p>
<p>From the book <em>Stories of Our Mormon Hymns</em> I quote: "When Evan Stephens was conductor of the Tabernacle Choir he was thrilled on one occasion by a sermon delivered by the late President Joseph F. Smith on the subject of 'The Third and Fourth Generations.'</p>
<p>At the close of the service Professor Stephens strolled alone up City Creek Canyon pondering the inspired words of the President. Suddenly the muse came upon him and seated upon a rock which was standing firm under the pressure of the rushing water and happily symbolic of his theme, he wrote with a pencil the words of '<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/true-to-the-faith?lang=eng" target="_blank">Shall The Youth of Zion Falter</a>?'" (Cornwall, J. Spencer.&nbsp;<em>Stories of Our Mormon Hymns</em>. Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret Book, 1963. Print.)</p>
<p>You know the words of this great hymn very well. It asks these challenging questions:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Shall</span></em><em> the Youth of Zion <strong>FALTER</strong>?<br /></em><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shall</span></em><em> we <strong>SHRINK </strong>or shun the fight?<br /></em><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shall</span></em><em> the children of the promise cease to <strong>GRASP</strong> the Iron rod?”</em></p>
<p>All of these questions are answered with a resounding, "<strong>NO</strong>!" And then the song proclaims these firm resolutions:</p>
<p><em>“We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> <strong>STRIVE </strong>to be found worthy<br /></em><em>We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will </span><strong>CLEAVE</strong> unto the truth<br /></em><em>We </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span><em> <strong>WATCH </strong>and <strong>PRAY</strong> and <strong>LABOR<br /></strong></em></p>
<p>All followed with a resounding, ‘<strong>YES</strong>!’”</p>
<p>Then the powerful chorus:</p>
<p><strong><em>“TRUE </em></strong><em>to the faith that our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">parents</span> have cherished,</em><br /> <strong><em>TRUE</em></strong><em> to the truth for which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">martyrs</span> have perished,&nbsp;</em><br /> <em>To God’s command,<br /></em><em>Soul, heart, and hand,&nbsp;<br /></em><strong><em>FAITHFUL</em></strong><em> and <strong>TRUE</strong> we will ever stand.” </em>[Emphasis added]</p>
<p><strong>Unshaken.</strong></p>
<p>Whether these three incidents are closely related or not, I do not know, but I am intrigued by that possibility. I do know that as the youth of Zion refuse to be shaken, Mormonism has and will<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>endure unaltered not only to the third and fourth generations, but to all generations of time, for it is the very eternal kingdom of God on the earth. Sister Vilate C. RAIL penned these stirring words regarding our valiant pioneer ancestors:</p>
<p>They cut desire into short lengths<br />And fed it to the hungry fires of tribulation.<br />Long after when the fires had died,<br />Molten gold gleamed in the ashes.<br />They gathered it in bruised palms<br />And handed it to their children<br />And their children’s children forever.</p>
<p>May we ever be true to the faith, and true to the truth, that with our noble pioneer ancestors we may ever stand <strong>unshaken,</strong> I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">A week ago Sunday, I was teaching a lesson in my ward’s High Priest Quorum. At the very beginning of the lesson period,&nbsp;a member of the class,&nbsp;a good friend of mine,&nbsp;slid down in his chair until he reached the perfect point at which the back of his chair comfortably supported his neck, and fell asleep.&nbsp;Worse yet, he slept&nbsp;hard&nbsp;until the end of the hour!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Please don’t do that today, at least not all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">Brothers and sisters, Aloha!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Let’s&nbsp;start today by&nbsp;using our&nbsp;imaginations&nbsp;and memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">I’d like you to remember a leader who has had a powerful, lifting effect in your life. A person who caused you to want to be better, but who also helped you to feel loved, even with all your imperfections. Someone who you wanted to follow and support because of their goodness and kindness.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Fix that person in your mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">For today, I ask you to define that kind of leader as&nbsp;a&nbsp;"gifted leader”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Would you agree that person was influenced by or had the&nbsp;gift of&nbsp;the Holy Spirit?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">What kind of preparation do you think that person went through to become who they are? What kind of price has to be paid to become a gifted leader?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Our Samoan brothers and sisters&nbsp;would answer&nbsp;this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"O le ala&nbsp;i&nbsp;le pule, o le&nbsp;tautua."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">In English : "The pathway&nbsp;to leadership, is service."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The abbreviated version of our School’s mission is that you are here to learn so that you may go on to lead and build,&nbsp;especially in your families and&nbsp;in the Kingdom of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">There is an order to this process. Learning prepares us for leading and building. And the process is life long, acting much like an upward spiral.&nbsp;That’s one of the great reasons for your attendance at BYUH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">In an article written several years ago,&nbsp;President Wheelwright said,&nbsp;“Our real charge as a university is not to prepare&nbsp;[our students]&nbsp;for the world&nbsp;we&nbsp;grew up in but for the world&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;going to be in and that they’re going to have to help lead. . . . It is about the total experience, and how well these young men and women are prepared.”<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">To lead in the world,&nbsp;of course&nbsp;you will be expected to have mastered your subject matter,&nbsp;to be competent organizers&nbsp;and to produce&nbsp;results.&nbsp;That’s the price of admission.&nbsp;But there is another dimension of leadership, part of what&nbsp;I think&nbsp;President Wheelwright describes as the “total experience,”&nbsp;that constitutes more than just the attainment of skills, but really constitutes a way of&nbsp;being, and that dimension is what will distinguish you as a leader of great influence, a gifted leader, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">President David O. McKay described&nbsp;it&nbsp;this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">“One man said the world needs men&nbsp;[and women]&nbsp;who cannot be bought or sold, men&nbsp;[and women]&nbsp;who will scorn to violate truth, genuine gold. That is what this school is going to produce.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup><br class="SCX45578644" /><br />“Genuine gold” is an interesting phrase. “Genuine&nbsp;gold” suggests that not all minerals that glitter like gold are the genuine article. The same is true of those we call leader. There is a genuineness or authenticity that people want in their leaders which,&nbsp;when&nbsp;present, makes&nbsp;that leader a person of lasting, positive influence…a&nbsp;"gifted leader".&nbsp;That type of leader is highly sought after&nbsp;and always&nbsp;in demand.&nbsp;The opposite is true of those&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;who&nbsp;lack the&nbsp;gifts of the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Our&nbsp;family had an experience that reinforced this while on a hiking vacation to one of our favorite national parks known as Yosemite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Yosemite’s&nbsp;home is the Sierra Nevada mountain range;&nbsp;a geologic wonder&nbsp;that provided the minerals&nbsp;that would give birth to the great California gold rush. "There was gold,"&nbsp;as the prospector’s would say, “in them&nbsp;thar’ hills,”&nbsp;and in the rivers too.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">At&nbsp;the time of this vacation our kids ranged from our youngest, Michael, about age eight to our oldest, Matthew, about&nbsp;twenty-one&nbsp;at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Just before we took our hike, we&nbsp;made a&nbsp;visit&nbsp;to the&nbsp;gift shop at the park. Aaron, our&nbsp;eighteen-year-old&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;found some&nbsp;“Fool's&nbsp;Gold"&nbsp;for sale.&nbsp;"Fool's&nbsp;Gold"&nbsp;or “Iron Pyrite” is&nbsp;a common mineral found in the Sierra Nevada so named for its shiny appearance. It’s&nbsp;actually nearly worthless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">So, Aaron devised a&nbsp;practical joke&nbsp;to salt some&nbsp;fool's&nbsp;gold&nbsp;at a shallow river crossing on our hiking path,&nbsp;and trick his innocent eight-year-old brother into thinking he’d discovered an amazing&nbsp;gold deposit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">So, Aaron hiked ahead to a shallow stream crossing to do his dirty work. When the rest of us arrived at the crossing,&nbsp;Aaron&nbsp;encouraged Michael to search the stream bed to see if the gold stories were true. Sure enough, Michael (with some&nbsp;help&nbsp;from Aaron) found his&nbsp;Gold and&nbsp;was thrilled with his new riches…that is,&nbsp;until I told him the truth….&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">I felt really bad as I watched Michael’s excitement&nbsp;crash&nbsp;to his feet.&nbsp;Although the sting of disappointment was soon over, I doubt Michael will ever trust the announcement of a gold&nbsp;strike&nbsp;again…at least by Aaron.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">That day, Michael learned, as most of us do, not all “gold” is genuine -&nbsp;so it is with people who carry the title of leader. Some are gifted and&nbsp;genuine&nbsp;"gold”&nbsp;leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;many&nbsp;in our world, unfortunately,&nbsp;are not able to&nbsp;meet the “gold standard” described by President McKay&nbsp;- so the scripture says: “many are called, but few are chosen.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">If you can stand it, I’d like to invite you to Family&nbsp;Home Evening for about 10 minutes. Sometimes in&nbsp;our&nbsp;Home&nbsp;Evenings, we&nbsp;would&nbsp;take&nbsp;deep dives&nbsp;into the scriptures.&nbsp;I hope it’s okay with you.&nbsp;Stay with me now.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Let’s&nbsp;take look at&nbsp;a very important revelation the Lord has given on the topic of leadership, in which he teaches us the difference between gifted or genuine gold leaders and those who&nbsp;have not achieved that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m quoting from the 121st&nbsp;Section of the Doctrine and Covenants&nbsp;(and&nbsp;I hope you will pardon the insertion of a couple of words of my own):</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">&nbsp;" …there are many&nbsp;(leaders&nbsp;and disciples)&nbsp;called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?"</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson—" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.34-35?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:34-35</a>)</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Before we go further, what does the Lord say prevents us from being gifted disciples and leaders? It's when our hearts are set upon "the things of the world" (described by Elder Oaks as pride, position, possessions, property and power<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>). And it's when we crave to be honored by the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">So,&nbsp;basically,&nbsp;when our mind is wrapped around our own advancement we fail to see:</p>
<p>"That the rights of the priesthood [leadership, power and influence] are inseparably connected with the power&nbsp;of&nbsp;heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">In the context of leadership&nbsp;then,&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;say that the ability to lead others as a “gifted” leader&nbsp;depends entirely&nbsp;on&nbsp;how richly we have&nbsp;cultivated the&nbsp;companionship of the Spirit, or the “powers of heaven.”&nbsp; The Lord continues:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"That [titles] may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.36-37?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:36-37</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">In other words, it is one thing to be granted the title of leader, but the mere grant of a title does not qualify that leader to be trusted by his or her followers. We are all children of God and have&nbsp;been endowed with&nbsp;a spiritual&nbsp;awareness of&nbsp;those who&nbsp;are guided by worthy motives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">To earn trust, the gifted leader motivates with a&nbsp;primary&nbsp;concern&nbsp;that the&nbsp;Lord’s&nbsp;purposes be fulfilled.&nbsp;Putting the Lord first, provides the necessary balance in leadership.&nbsp;This principle holds true in every set of circumstances;&nbsp;at home,&nbsp;at Church and in the workplace.&nbsp;The props and the&nbsp;vocabulary may differ between settings, but the principles are the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.39?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:39</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The Lord here observes that self-centered leaders are very common,&nbsp;and it’s no wonder since the great challenge of this life is the choice between Christ-centered-ness and self-centered-ness.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The Lord concludes:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"Hence many are called, but few are chosen." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121:40</a>)</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Now He explains how to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;“genuine gold” or gifted leader:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood&nbsp;(or any other leadership title you want to insert, including that of parent), only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41-44?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">D&amp;C 121: 41-44</a>)</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Do you notice that&nbsp;the Lord directs&nbsp;us to lead with virtues that the scriptures use elsewhere to describe the&nbsp;pure love of Christ?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Now, are there times when leaders have to deal with&nbsp;serious challenges?&nbsp;All the time!&nbsp;And, as the Lord reminds, sharpness is occasionally called for and should be applied when the Spirit tells us to.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">But&nbsp;if we’ve been inspired to be sharp,&nbsp;to remain a trusted leader,&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;counsels&nbsp;us to&nbsp;show an&nbsp;increase&nbsp;of&nbsp;love toward the person we have corrected, before Satan has a chance to&nbsp;worm his way in and damage relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">We’ve been speaking of the duties of a leader.&nbsp;But what about those of us who are called to follow?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Leaders are not alone in their responsibility to behave well.&nbsp;Building&nbsp;a family, a business or a Kingdom&nbsp;&nbsp;requires a close partnership between leaders and followers, or disciples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Followers must be willing to be&nbsp;led&nbsp;to fulfill the Lord’s purposes. A gifted disciple&nbsp;supports&nbsp;the principle that&nbsp;a gifted leader’s first responsibility is to the Lord, and to lead the people accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Among other things, the disciple or follower has a responsibility to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;appropriate correction with humility.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Let’s watch a video segment in which we see this occur between the Lord and His Chief Apostle, Peter.&nbsp;Let’s watch for the correcting moment and the “increase of love”.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;[Video]&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">&nbsp;Let’s&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;discipleship for a minute.&nbsp;As we remembered earlier, the path to leadership is service.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">What can we do as&nbsp;learners,&nbsp;followers&nbsp;or disciples&nbsp;to be an influence for good, and to&nbsp;prepare for leadership?&nbsp;I’d like to suggest a few ideas to which you can add your own.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">First,&nbsp;the gifted disciple is&nbsp;always trying to live&nbsp;by the pure love of Christ&nbsp;-&nbsp;to love and render service to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Sometimes, when we’re concerned about our own ego or advancement, we may be tempted to behave selfishly and&nbsp;engage in negative behaviors like envy, jealousy, striving for position or to be noticed,&nbsp;and&nbsp;as&nbsp;President Hinckley would call it, fruitless, carping criticism.&nbsp; I believe&nbsp;that&nbsp;selfish&nbsp;people are&nbsp;largely motivated by pride and fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Selfish people have a hard time listening to others. And as one person put&nbsp;it, selfish people feel a need to be the bride or groom at&nbsp;every&nbsp;wedding and the eulogized person at&nbsp;every&nbsp;funeral.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The gifted disciple realizes, as Elder&nbsp;Neal A.&nbsp;Maxwell&nbsp;once&nbsp;said:&nbsp;“Given the glad reality of who we are, there is no reason to prove anything to anybody&nbsp;after the manner of the world.”<span style="font-size: 8.3333330154419px;"><a href="#4">4</a></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Self-centered people forget&nbsp;“that all flesh is in” the Lord’s hands. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples, on the other hand,&nbsp;know that the Lord, not man, is really in control. So, as Brother Marcum&nbsp;reminded us last week, disciples of Christ need not fear to do good, even when our pride&nbsp;and fear of failure&nbsp;would prevent us.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">This&nbsp;means, among other things that we don’t have to engage in the behaviors of the world that&nbsp;show&nbsp;a lack of understanding about who&nbsp;we&nbsp;are -&nbsp;the sons and daughters of a God of miracles.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Remember, brothers and sisters, our Lord miraculously&nbsp;fed five thousand people and holds our universe in balance. And yet, as Elder&nbsp;Neal A.&nbsp;Maxwell once said,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lord will&nbsp;micromanage&nbsp;our lives, if we let Him.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Brothers and sisters, if you’re feeling concerned about the progress in your life, whatever it may be, I promise you that if you will pray for&nbsp;and act&nbsp;with&nbsp;charity, the Lord will reveal individualized guidance to you and open doors&nbsp;for your good&nbsp;according to His will.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Second,&nbsp;the gifted disciple has the faith to be humble&nbsp;and patient.&nbsp;Luke recorded:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"And he&nbsp;(the Lord)&nbsp;put forth a parable to those which were bidden&nbsp;(to a feast), when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more&nbsp;honorable&nbsp;man than thou be bidden of him;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">For whosoever&nbsp;exalteth&nbsp;himself shall be abased; and he that&nbsp;humbleth&nbsp;himself shall be exalted." &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/14.7-11?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Luke 14:7-11</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Third,&nbsp;a gifted disciple is converted to the Lord’s view of greatness.&nbsp;Matthew records:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"Then came to him&nbsp;(that is, Jesus)&nbsp;the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons&nbsp;(James and John), worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She&nbsp;saith&nbsp;unto him, Grant that these my two&nbsp;sons&nbsp;may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:" &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/20.20-21,%2024-27?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Matthew 20:20-21, 24-27</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Similarly, from the Book of Mark:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">"And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he&nbsp;(the Lord)&nbsp;asked them&nbsp;(the apostles), What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">And he sat down, and called the twelve, and&nbsp;saith&nbsp;unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/9.33-35?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">Mark 9:33-35</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Fourth,&nbsp;gifted disciples realize that it’s a distortion to&nbsp;view our own worth by comparing ourselves to others.&nbsp;They&nbsp;remember what the Lord asked Peter when he became concerned about John’s role in the kingdom…the Lord&nbsp;asked Peter&nbsp;“…what is <em>that</em> to thee? follow thou me.”&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/21.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">John 21:22</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">Therefore, brothers and sisters:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples are&nbsp;happy when someone else is recognized for an accomplishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples&nbsp;acknowledge, give credit for,&nbsp;and applaud the good ideas of another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples do not&nbsp;think that&nbsp;they&nbsp;will be elevated by diminishing others. Rather, they seek to lift, congratulate and acknowledge others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">They realize that a sincere compliment to a fellow disciple may feel like a cool drink to a parched soul. We compliment and thank each other too&nbsp;seldom, brothers and sisters.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Without condoning serious hypocrisy or wrongdoing, gifted disciples are able to overlook the faults and failings of others realizing that their own faults and failings provide plenty of material with which to concern themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples are not doormats. They are intellectually engaged and ask questions that&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;learning, improving&nbsp;and building. They do not expect their leaders to be perfect nor to make every decision perfectly.&nbsp;But, they&nbsp;are&nbsp;grateful for the hard work and goodness of their leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples give the same respect to leaders that they themselves would hope for if the roles were reversed.&nbsp;They are grateful that the Lord will work through all of us&nbsp;if&nbsp;we will let Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">When&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;issues and&nbsp;questions&nbsp;arise,&nbsp;gifted disciples find kind-hearted,&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;private ways to ask their questions&nbsp;or raise their concerns.&nbsp;Knowing how to&nbsp;ask a sensitive question&nbsp;or&nbsp;express an alternate point of view in a clear, articulate manner, without becoming overheated, is a high skill. A high conversational temperature reading is often&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;pride.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Gifted disciples are responsible&nbsp;when they&nbsp;express ideas,&nbsp;considering the tenderness of the faith and feelings of others in the conversation. It is&nbsp;good practice to “think all that you speak, but not speak all that you think.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Again, gifted disciples are grateful for the&nbsp;goodness of their leader’s lives, for the good they’ve done,&nbsp;and render the heart-felt thanks they would hope to receive if the roles were reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Brothers and Sisters, when&nbsp;the&nbsp;appropriate price&nbsp;is paid&nbsp;in learning and experience,&nbsp;gifted disciples&nbsp;are prepared to&nbsp;become gifted leaders…and both are gifted builders.&nbsp;Charity, a “building” virtue,&nbsp;is&nbsp;always&nbsp;the hallmark of a gifted disciple and a gifted leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">I have been blessed to know many people who are both gifted disciples and leaders, many of them right here&nbsp;on campus!&nbsp;I hope you&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;the wonderful opportunity you have right now to increase your discipleship&nbsp;in a major way. An education at BYU-Hawaii is a rare opportunity that&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;you treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">I’d like to share a story that has inspired me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">We are acquainted with a family who had a son out on a mission.&nbsp;As his mission came to a close,&nbsp;the main office at the Church made travel arrangements for the young man to come home, with notification to his family and the mission office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The young Elder had served an excellent mission and had served with an equally talented and qualified group of Elders and Sisters who had come from the MTC together,&nbsp;and would return home on the same release date. Many of these missionaries had served in&nbsp;important leadership and training positions,&nbsp;and some still did.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Somehow, the impending release date of that missionary group escaped the attention of the mission president until after all the travel arrangements were made.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Understandably,&nbsp;when he found out,&nbsp;he had a mild panic attack!&nbsp;Imagine losing a sizable group of seasoned missionaries by surprise!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">No one really knew where the miscommunication had occurred&nbsp;-&nbsp;certainly the mission president wasn’t&nbsp;looking&nbsp;for problems, it just happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">As this faithful and stunned mission president started to work his way through&nbsp;pushing back some&nbsp;release and travel dates, some of the missionaries and their families were agitated.&nbsp;“How could this happen?”,&nbsp;“We’ve made our plans already!”.&nbsp;Unfortunately, some unkind things were said about the mission president.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The mother of our missionary friend saw more than a&nbsp;lesson in&nbsp;travel inconvenience&nbsp;for her son, though.&nbsp;Listen to the&nbsp;letter&nbsp;she sent her son&nbsp;(with names changed to protect the innocent):&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph" xml:lang="EN-US">Dear John&nbsp;(every missionary should get at least one “Dear John” letter):&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">I've prayed several times&nbsp;before writing this to you.  I understand&nbsp;your&nbsp;disappointment!  But let's try to see things from a different angle...&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">First, your President’s request that you to stay on for another five weeks is actually a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;compliment to you! If you weren’t&nbsp;a&nbsp;faithful&nbsp;Elder, he'd be happy to have you on that earlier airplane! It might be that he really&nbsp;needs&nbsp;you to stay!  You've been a hard-working and obedient Elder—and he&nbsp;has been a faithful, hard-working&nbsp;Mission President,&nbsp;who&nbsp;is&nbsp;worn out&nbsp;from&nbsp;doing his best to keep the Lord's work going successfully.  He's not being difficult, he really does need you!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">So, what does that mean for you?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">John, you have an opportunity to step up and do something bigger than yourself—for&nbsp;your Father in Heaven.  And&nbsp;I PROMISE YOU,&nbsp;HE WILL BLESS YOU FOR IT!  I am as sure of that, as the beating of my heart! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">I don't know why this happened—why this change in plans&nbsp;came about after you'd already received a release date!  Yes, you may feel tired.  You feel worn out and ready to come home!  That's good too—that means you've served honorably, worked hard, and given your heart to the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Now,&nbsp;stomp out every feeling of anger, bitterness, and contention you&nbsp;may&nbsp;have right now!  Don't give in to backbiting… do not say one negative thing about&nbsp;your mission president.&nbsp;Don't even think it.  Picture a&nbsp;faithful leader&nbsp;who is equally tired and&nbsp;looking forward to a rest as much as you are! And then decide how you're going to support him, love him,&nbsp;and&nbsp;sustain him. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">You have an opportunity to become an amazing leader by being an amazing follower first.  Someday you'll look back (as tired as you are of hearing that phrase) and be so glad that you didn't give in to pride and anger, and grumpily finish out those five weeks like a martyr!  You'll be so glad that you gave it your&nbsp;extra everything—that&nbsp;you went the distance and then some! I remember at one point in your mission that you were a little concerned about not serving a full two year mission&nbsp;because of the transfer dates—well, now you're being given the chance to do exactly that, plus a little more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Be like Nephi.  You go and DO!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Love, Mom&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The happy ending to that story is,&nbsp;that young Elder listened to the Spirit and finished his mission with distinction.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Incidentally,&nbsp;sisters,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are richly blessed by our gifted mothers!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">You might remember&nbsp;that when President Hinckley was a discouraged missionary and wanted to come home, his dad simply wrote: “forget yourself and go to work.”<a href="#6"><span style="font-size: 8.3333330154419px;"><sup>6</sup></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Either way, the message is the same!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">The point of finishing my talk with that letter is to remind&nbsp;you that your greatest work as a gifted disciple and gifted leader will be in your own homes with your own children. How can you do anything greater than to influence&nbsp;entire generations&nbsp;for good?!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SCX45578644 Paragraph">Brothers and Sisters, a couple of ideas in closing:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal1">Aloha Brothers and Sisters,</p>
<p class="Normal1">I am truly honored to stand before you today and wish to thank all of those who have made this possible. I am grateful for my wonderful wife Stephanie and wish to thank her for her introduction. I am grateful for each of my children, Alison, Sariah, Grant, and Isaac. They have brought immense joy into my life and I am a better person for being their father. I am grateful for my parents, Robert and Janene Marcum. They are people full of faith and I am blessed to carry their name. I hope that what I say today will reflect well on them. I am grateful to all you who have touched my life for good. It is a privilege to be among you. As President Hinckley said after his call as a general authority, “all of us are largely the products of the lives which touch upon our lives, and today I feel profoundly grateful for all who have touched mine.” (<a href="http://scriptures.byu.edu/gettalk.php?ID=944" target="_blank">“An Expression of Gratitude,”</a> April 1958 General Conference)</p>
<p class="Normal1">Like many of you, when our family moved to Hawaii, we wanted to try surfing. Although surfing was difficult at first, my wife and I fell in love with it. Now, surfing is one our favorite things to do together. On our Friday night dates we will often enjoy the last waves of the day. But, like most worthwhile things surfing is not always problem-free. Let me tell you about my first surfing accident. It was a beautiful day and the surfing break was more crowded than usual. After catching a wave, out of the corner of my eye, I could see that an inexperienced young lady caught the same wave. Soon, we were on a collision course. I quickly sat down on my board and tried to back out of the wave. She also saw our potential collision and panicked, half-fell and half-jumped off the back of her board into the water. The force of her jumping off the back of her board forced the board forward at what seemed like blinding speed. From my sitting position I tried to go under the water, but I was too slow. The tip of her very hard surf board hit me, splitting my head open above my eye. I was badly dazed, but fortunately still conscious. When I surfaced, I checked the spot of collision with my hand and could see I was bleeding badly. I knew I needed to get to shore quickly. As I paddled, I could feel myself getting more and more light-headed and I felt like I was going to faint and fall into the water. Luckily, another surfer saw my situation and helped me to shore. After a trip to the hospital and a few stitches, all was well.</p>
<p class="Normal1">After getting my stitches off, I looked forward to getting back into the water. However, the next time I went surfing, as I swam out to the break, an intense feeling of fear and dread overcame me. It made my heart beat rapidly and every time I caught a wave I thought every surfer within 20 feet was a hospital visit waiting to happen. I began to think, what if I get hit again? What if I don’t stay conscious? What if I can’t get back to shore? I could drown. I have a family to take care of. Suddenly, surfing wasn’t worth the risk. So, I swam out of the water and watched my family from the shore. Sad, right? Fear is powerful.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Elder Bednar taught us in April conference,</p>
<p class="Normal1">“... after partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve hid themselves in the Garden of Eden. God called unto Adam and asked, ‘Where art thou? And [Adam answered], I heard thy voice …&nbsp;, and I was afraid’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/3.9-10?lang=eng#8">Genesis 3:9–10</a>). Notably, one of the first effects of the Fall was for Adam and Eve to experience fear.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/therefore-they-hushed-their-fears?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Therefore They Hushed Their Fears,”</a> April 2015 General Conference)</p>
<p class="Normal1">We live in a potentially scary time. Paul, in his letter to Timothy said,</p>
<p>“This know also, that in the&nbsp;last days&nbsp;perilous&nbsp;times&nbsp;shall come.</p>
<p>For men shall be lovers of their own selves,&nbsp;covetous, boasters,&nbsp;proud, blasphemers,&nbsp;disobedient&nbsp;to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p>Without&nbsp;natural&nbsp;affection,&nbsp;trucebreakers,&nbsp;false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p>Traitors,&nbsp;heady,&nbsp;high-minded, lovers of&nbsp;pleasures&nbsp;more than lovers of God;” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1-4?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3: 1-4</a>)</p>
<p class="Normal1">Many of you and your families have been hurt personally by Satan’s efforts. Like my surfing accident made me reconsider surfing, these conditions and experiences are causing many of you to fear. So, brothers and sisters, what are those fears? From my interactions with you, I have noticed that many of you are worried about the increasing wickedness in the world. You know that it is likely that many will ridicule us, belittle us, and hate us for our beliefs. I know some of you wonder if an ideal family is possible. Can you really have a happy family when so many suffer from the affects of divorce, abuse, drugs, alcohol, pornography, etcetera? My hope today is that the Holy Ghost will give you confidence in these matters, so that you can move forward in faith.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Let’s talk about the emotion of fear. I learned a couple of things from my surfing accident about it. First, it can’t be trusted. Our bodies are extraordinary, God’s greatest physical creation. They produce many different types of feelings. Some are more reliable than others. Love, joy, faith, longsuffering, all can be trusted. But, fear is the great deceiver. It can rob us of what is good in life. For me, I love to be in the water. There is a peace and serenity to surfing that I enjoy. The consistency of the surfing break, the sound of the waves and feel of the water as you glide across it. For a short time, fear robbed me of that. The surf and the water became treacherous, and the people threatening. Neither of which are true.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The second thing I learned from my accident is that fears can be calmed, and replaced with peace. Fear need not plague us. In his most recent address, Elder Bednar used Alma’s people as an example:</p>
<p class="Normal1">“In the land of Helam, Alma’s people were frightened by an advancing Lamanite army.</p>
<p>‘But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but … should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.</p>
<p>‘Therefore they hushed their fears’ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.27-28?lang=eng#26">Mosiah 23:27–28</a>).</p>
<p>Notice Alma did not hush the people’s fears. Rather, Alma counseled the believers to remember the Lord and the deliverance only He could bestow (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8?lang=eng#7">2&nbsp;Nephi 2:8</a>). And knowledge of the Savior’s protecting watchcare enabled the people to hush their own fears.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/therefore-they-hushed-their-fears?lang=eng">“Therefore They Hushed Their Fears,”</a> April 2015 General Conference)</p>
<p class="Normal1">When the Savior told his disciples of the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem, that they would be afflicted, hated, and even killed, his disciples were fearful. Jesus asked them to calm their fears. He told them, “Be not troubled, for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled”</p>
<p class="Normal1">We must believe in Christ. That he is good on his word. Can we live happily and stand up for our beliefs in a wicked world? Can we raise happy and righteous families? The simple answer to this question is a resounding, YES! God has commanded. Nephi was right. God prepares a way for us to fulfill His commandments. He has promised blessings for our obedience. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">D&amp;C 59:23</a> states:</p>
<p class="Normal1">But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.</p>
<p class="Normal1">God will make good on these promises. There is a reward waiting for us. But that reward is not just waiting for us, peace is available now. Peace brothers and sisters. Not doubt, not worry, not fear, but peace. President Hinckley stated:</p>
<p class="Normal1">“As I look to the future, I see little to feel enthusiastic about concerning the family in America and across the world… [but] I see a wonderful future in a very uncertain world. If we will cling to our values, if we will build on our inheritance, if we will walk in obedience before the Lord, if we will simply live the gospel we will be blessed in a magnificent and wonderful way. We will be looked upon as a peculiar people who have found the key to a peculiar happiness.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/10/look-to-the-future?lang=eng" target="_blank">"Look to the Future,"</a>&nbsp;October 1997 General Conference)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal1">Let me show you a clip from Elder Holland that he gave, not 3 months ago:</p>
<p class="Normal1">[video]</p>
<p class="Normal1">“The momentum that began in a grove of trees in upstate New York two centuries ago will&nbsp;<em>continue</em>&nbsp;to roll forth, unabated and undeniable—Daniel’s stone cut out of the mountain without hands.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/article/evening-with-a-general-authority/2015/02/helping-with-the-real-issues?lang=eng#5-PD10053224_000_11">5</a>&nbsp;That scriptural kingdom will be triumphant, and it will prevail. Unlike every other era before us, this dispensation will&nbsp;<em>not </em>experience an institutional apostasy; it will&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;see a loss of priesthood keys; it will&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;suffer a cessation of revelation from the voice of Almighty God. Individuals will apostatize, they may turn a deaf ear to heaven, but <em>never</em>&nbsp;again will the dispensation collectively do so. What a secure thought that is! What a day in which to live! What a way to cut through fear or faintheartedness….</p>
<p class="Normal1">We know for certain that if and when everything else in the latter days is down or dying; if governments, economies, industries, and institutions crumble; if societies and cultures become a quagmire of chaos and insecurity, nevertheless, through it all the gospel of Jesus Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that bears that gospel to the world will stand triumphant. It will stand undefiled in God’s hand until the very Son of God Himself comes to rule and reign as Lord of lords and King of kings. Nothing is more certain in this world. Nothing is more sure. Nothing could be more of an antidote to anxiety. As the Prophet Joseph declared, and as a generation of missionaries quote with fervor: The truth of God will sweep every country and sound in every ear. No unhallowed hand can stop it from progressing.&nbsp;Still true.”</p>
<p class="Normal1">&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/article/evening-with-a-general-authority/2015/02/helping-with-the-real-issues?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Be not Afraid, Only Believe,”</a> An Evening with a General Authority, February 6, 2015)</p>
<p class="Normal1">&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;__________________________________</p>
<p class="Normal1">Satan is on a rampage. Yes. But, his temper tantrum is nothing compared to the glorious and magnificent work that God is doing. We have so much to believe in, so much to have confidence in.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Do you remember the story of Gideon in the Book of Judges? For those of you unfamiliar. Gideon was called by the Lord to save Israel from bondage to the Midianites. He saved Israel with only 300 weaponless men. I believe these 300 men are great examples of how to calm fears and replace those fears with peace from God.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Imagine, that invaders have largely destroyed your land. These Midianites have killed many you love and your family is on the verge of starvation. You hear a messenger come through your village claiming that Gideon—someone you do not know—is gathering together an army to fight the Midianites. You want freedom so much, you are willing to fight for it. So you go. You arrive at the army's camp. Sure enough Gideon’s army is large, 32,000 strong. But, from what you hear, the Midianites still heavily outnumber you. Then your leader does something unimaginable. He gathers together your great army and commands, “whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart”. To your astonishment, many, more than two thirds of the army, leave.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Soon, you find out that Gideon is not done trimming your number. One day, after getting a drink of water, Gideon sends most of your army back to their tents. When I say most, I really mean pretty much everyone. In fact, there are only 300 of you left. 300! The tabernacle choir has more members than that. Then, you receive your orders. Your band of 300 are to surround the Midianite host by night, but not with swords, or spears, but with a ram’s horn and a lamp concealed by a water pitcher. On Gideon’s signal, you are to blow your horn, break the water pitcher—exposing your lamp, and yell. Then you are to stand there. Not run, not attack, just stand there. Those are your orders. Imagine you are standing there in the dark. Would you be able to reveal your location to your enemies? Then, stand there, holding your light? Well, they did. And they watched as confusion spread through the Midianite camp and the Midianites slaughtered each other then ran away. How were they able to do this? Here is what I learn from them.</p>
<p class="Normal1">First, Gideon’s people desired to be free of the Midianites more than anything else. I believe that spiritual courage must be driven by a deep and intense desire to do good, to be obedient, and to be free of, fear, doubt, anger, pain &amp; sorrow. A deep desire to enjoy God’s promised blessings, including the blessings of family.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Second, we must realize that we need help and we cannot overcome our fears on our own. Before Gideon formed his army, the children of Israel did try to free themselves from the Midianites without the help of God. They built strongholds and caves in the hills for a defense. Unfortunately, this left their fields and flocks exposed, and the Midianites destroyed “the increase of the earth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/judg/6.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Judges 6:4</a>). As smart as their plan seemed, without the Lord, it only made their situation more difficult.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Too many turn to other sources, including friends, books, experts, or Facebook for answers, comfort, and reassurance. It is not that the advice of others are always evil (even though sometimes it is), these sources of wisdom are more often simply powerless. Just as these 300 soldiers could not be free of the Midianites without God’s help and Gideon’s inspired counsel, all of us cannot be free from the sorrow, sin, fear, and doubt without the Atonement of Christ and the guidance of his prophets. As King Benjamin taught, “And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:17</a>)</p>
<p class="Normal1">I bear my witness that it is only through Jesus Christ the redeemer of the world that we can have joy, peace, and courage in this life.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Third, we must commune with God. After Israel became impoverished from the Midianite destruction, they finally cried unto God for help. Communing with God includes meaningful prayer and consistent scripture study.</p>
<p class="Normal1">After my surfing accident, my family began a tradition of praying before surfing. After we pull the boards out of the truck, we pray, and ask for God’s protection, guidance, and an awe for his creations. This simple act reminds me that God is in control. While I needed to be wise and not take unnecessary risks, I did not need to fear. All of us can pray to God for help. We all can feel the peace that comes from recognizing God is over all, and all things are in His hands. As <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.5?lang=eng#4">D&amp;C 10:5</a> states, “Pray always… that you may conquer Satan”. Conquering Satan includes conquering fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal1">But, seeking God’s help, cannot only include prayer. We must study what he has said through his prophets. One of the interesting parts of the story of Gideon is the phrase they shouted. In the original Hebrew, Gideon simply asks them to shout, “The Lord and Gideon”. However, when the shout came the soldiers added something. They yelled, “The sword of the Lord and of Gideon”. Why did they add sword? It was a reference to an experience of their ancestors, a scriptural story they drew courage from. A few generations earlier the captain of the Lord’s host, who probably was Christ himself, visited Joshua with a sword in his hand. He gave Joshua strange instructions on how to defeat Jericho. Joshua’s army surrounded Jericho, blew trumpets, and the walls came tumbling down.</p>
<p class="Normal1">I am sure this story inspired Gideon’s men. Just like their ancestors, they surrounded their enemy holding horn trumpets and their ancestor’s success gave them courage. We too can draw courage from the scriptures and from our righteous ancestors. Please, brothers and sisters, spend some time everyday with God’s word. Do not neglect this. You cannot afford to. When Jesus warned that in the last days many of his elect would be deceived, including the deception of fear, he gave us all a guarantee against deception. He said,</p>
<p>“And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived, for the Son of Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the remainder of his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.37?lang=eng#36">Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:37</a>)</p>
<p class="Normal1">&nbsp;I love that word treasure. I think it communicates that God’s word is not something read like a novel, or in the case of General Conference, watched like a Movie. God’s word needs to be considered carefully, pondered on, and prayed about.</p>
<p class="Normal1">But, the word treasure also implies an important no-no. You cannot treasure the scriptures and be critical of the prophets. Notice that Gideon did some strange things that would not have made much sense. Decreasing the army to 300. Only using trumpets and lamps, instead of weapons. Your church leaders may do something that you do not understand, or even disagree with. This does not give you the right to be critical of them. Joseph Smith once said,</p>
<p class="Normal1">“I will give you one of the [keys] of the mysteries of the kingdom. It is an eternal principle, that has existed with God from all eternity: That man who rises up to condemn others, finding fault with the Church, saying that they are out of the way, while he himself is righteous, then know assuredly, that that man is in the high road to apostasy; and if he does not repent, will apostatize, as God lives.” (Joseph Smith, DHC, vol. 3 p. 385.)</p>
<p class="Normal1">Joseph knew this from sad experience. Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, David Whitmer — the three witnesses to the Book of Mormon—, Sidney Rigdon — His counselor in the First Presidency—, Thomas Marsh—President of the Quorum of the Twelve—, all fell. If they fell, all of us can fall. All we have to do is say, “The prophet is wrong, I know a better way”.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Fourth - once we know what the Lord expects, we must <strong>act</strong> with courage. Not too long after my surfing accident, I overcame my fear. But I had to get in the water. I know that Satan is using fear on many of you so that you will not step “into the water” of dating and courtship, or marriage. You must believe in Jesus Christ and follow the prophets. They have encouraged you to pursue marriage. They have not said to wait until you finish school or have a steady career. They have not said that you need to enjoy life first. They have not made exceptions from one culture to another. The world teaches you to wait to marry for one reason or another. These beliefs are often driven by fear, usually taught by someone who had a bad experience. Do some have tragic experiences in their marriage? Of course. But this does not mean that marriage is unsafe for everyone else. That is like me, after my surfing accident, standing on the beach and screaming, “don’t get in the water, you will get hit in the head.”</p>
<p class="Normal1">You must be active in your pursuit of an eternal companion. You must follow and exercise faith. Marriage is part of your mission here. Now, I know that some of you will try faithfully to be married while you are here, and will not succeed. That is okay. The Lord has you in mind and will provide marriage in His time. But, for the most part, there is too much complacency and fear among you when it comes to dating and marriage. If you are to enjoy the blessings the Lord has in store, you must hush these fears, and move forward in faith.</p>
<p class="Normal1">As I mentioned, some of you worry over the persecution that accompanies a faithful life. This fear of man may convince you to hide your faith. Acting with courage requires us to act publicly. Just as Gideon’s small force powerfully made themselves known to their enemies, we must expose our faith to others. The world tries to force us to make our faith a private matter. On the other hand, Christ requires that our faith be a public announcement. “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” Now, I know that most of you, especially those here at devotional, are good examples, and you strive to be a good example to others. But, I would like to mention a couple of commandments where we need more good examples.</p>
<p class="Normal1">In 1997 President Hinckley said,</p>
<p>“The Sabbath of the Lord is becoming the play day of the people. It is a day of golf and football on television, of buying and selling in our stores and markets. Are we moving to mainstream America as some observers believe? In this I fear we are. What a telling thing it is to see the parking lots of the markets filled on Sunday in communities that are predominately LDS.</p>
<p>“Our strength for the future, our resolution to grow the Church across the world, will be weakened if we violate the will of the Lord in this important matter. He has so very clearly spoken anciently and again in modern revelation. We cannot disregard with impunity that which He has said.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/10/look-to-the-future?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Look to the Future,”</a> October 1997 General Conference)</p>
<p class="Normal1">Now, let me show you something very interesting:</p>
<p class="Normal1">This graph shows how many new convert baptisms the church received each year, since 1970. You can see in recent years things have flattened a bit. Now, what strikes me is the changing point. If we look at everything before 1997 you can see a pretty steep growth line. But, everything after 1997, is fairly flat. In 1997, when President Hinckley gave this message, that year we had 317,798 convert baptisms. Last year it was 296,803. Now is our inability to live the Sabbath day as a people the sole cause of this this leveling off? I doubt it. In fact in the same talk given in 1997, President Hinckley also included other commandments concerned him. But, I know that those store parking lots in LDS communities are still full. Here, in Laie, we are still using Sunday as a day for watching football, or going to the beach. Far too many of us use the Sabbath as our playday. In our society, even in Laie, there is quite a bit of pressure to break the Sabbath. But, we cannot give in. We must live this commandment and let others know that those who live the Sabbath day live the fuller happier life, and those who do not live it are the ones that are missing out.</p>
<p class="Normal1">I love the Sabbath day. It rejuvenates me and is the happiest day of my week. I get to feel the spirit with great people at church. I enjoy the spiritual time at home with my wife and children. I get to serve others in my calling, meet with them, and feel the spirit with them. I love to do these things. I would never trade these blessings for a football game or surfing. Such a trade would be crazy.</p>
<p class="Normal1">But making our home holy cannot just be a Sunday exercise. One of the phrases that I love in the story of Gideon is: “And they stood every man in his place” I am reminded of <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">D&amp;C 45:32</a>, which reads:</p>
<p class="Normal1">“But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.”</p>
<p class="Normal1">Brothers and sisters are you standing in Holy places? Is your apartment or dorm a holy place? I know that many of you, for some reason, are afraid of what your roommates will think if you tell them that the music they listen to, the video game they are playing, or the show they are watching is offensive to you. But, brothers and sisters, having the place you live be a Holy Place is of primary importance. As great as this campus, the church, and the temple are, they are not enough. Your most important Holy place is where you live. You must work with your roommates at creating a place where the Spirit can truly be always with you. You cannot afford to permit inappropriate video games, music, movies, or language to offend the spirit. Satan does not leave empty homes vacant. Once the Spirit is gone Satan and his angels will move in. You and your roommates must pray together, discuss the gospel together, listen and sing wholesome music together, and invite the spirit through uplifting and positive conversation.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Fortunately, in addition to your home, you have the church and the temple available to you. What an amazing blessing it is to have the temple so close. I know we refer to this school as the Lord’s university. And in many ways that is appropriate. However, the temple is really where the Lord teaches each of us personally. It is a place where He will teach you.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Not only that, the temple is where we recruit ministering angels to help us in our fight against the adversary. Malachi taught through temple work, the hearts of the fathers would turn to their children, and vice versa. Joseph F. Smith taught:</p>
<p class="Normal1">“Our fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and friends who have passed away from this earth, having been faithful, and worthy to enjoy these rights and privileges, may have a mission given them to visit their relatives and friends upon the earth again, bringing from the divine Presence messages of love, of warning, or reproof and instruction, to those whom they had learned to love in the flesh.” (Gospel Doctrine, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1970, pp. 435–36.)</p>
<p class="Normal1">Every time we go to the temple and do work for our families that have passed on, we help them be worthy of the right and privilege to be ministering angels. One of the saddest things I ever heard said on this campus was at a fast and testimony meeting a few years ago. A sister, who was graduating, shared in her testimony that she had been at the school for four years but only attended the temple three times. What a tragedy. Brothers and sisters, please make it a priority to visit the Lord’s house as often as you can. Think how much you would grow if you could say, after being her four years, that you attended the temple 100 times, instead of 3.</p>
<p class="Normal1">I know brothers and sisters that the world is going to get worse. More and more families are going to fall apart. Every generation will have to be better than the one preceding it to have the joy of the gospel, free of fear and doubt. I do not fear the evil of the world, but I do look forward to the day when Christ will cleanse these evils from this earth. But, he will not come until his work is complete. How quickly he comes to save us from an increasingly evil world is partly up to us. The prophets are trying to get us to hasten Christ’s work. But, we cannot hasten His work unless we are more obedient as a people and let that obedience shine. I am reminded of the Savior’s words to Joseph and Oliver,</p>
<p>“Fear not&nbsp;to do&nbsp;good, my sons, for whatsoever ye&nbsp;sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow&nbsp;good&nbsp;ye shall also reap good for your&nbsp;reward.</p>
<p>Therefore, fear not, little&nbsp;flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are&nbsp;built&nbsp;upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</p>
<p>Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and&nbsp;sin no more; perform with soberness the work which I have commanded you.</p>
<p>Look&nbsp;unto me in every&nbsp;thought;&nbsp;doubt&nbsp;not, fear not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behold&nbsp;the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the&nbsp;nails&nbsp;in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall&nbsp;inherit&nbsp;the kingdom&nbsp;of heaven.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.33,34,35,36,37?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">D&amp;C 6: 33-37</a>)</p>
<p class="Normal1">We must be do better. We can do better. We will do better. Of this I am sure. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, Kia Ora and Aloha!<br />I appreciate the introduction given by my daughter, Arapera.&nbsp; She is an example to me in many ways, and I am grateful for her goodness and love her dearly. Thank you, Arapera.<br />I also appreciate the beautiful music performed, the scripture that was read, and the prayer given today, along with the many other efforts offered by all those who have contributed to this devotional. Thank you all. <br />I am grateful for the invitation to speak today, and I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may be with us that all may be edified.</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk about sheep. <br />In the scriptures, the Savior identifies himself as the Good Shepherd, and is also called the Lamb of God.&nbsp; He refers to us as His sheep, the sheep of his fold.</p>
<p>“I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep….</p>
<p>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine….</p>
<p>and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.11-16?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">John 10:11-16</a>)</p>
<p>I imagine most of us here have not spent much time around sheep, so I think it’s important to mention a few things about sheep in order to better understand the Savior’s analogy and reference to them in the scriptures.<br />So here’s a few interesting facts about sheep.</p>
<p>There are over a billion sheep in the world today.&nbsp; Sheep are one of the oldest kinds of domesticated animals and provide wool, meat, milk, wool oil known as lanolin, and other products.&nbsp; We know that Abel, the son of Adam, was a keeper of sheep, as were many of the other Biblical prophets, including Abraham, Jacob, and Moses.&nbsp; Sheep were also an important primary sacrificial animal in religious ordinances in Biblical times.</p>
<p>Sheep have some interesting characteristics.&nbsp; They have great peripheral vision with a range of between 191 to 306 degrees.&nbsp; This means that they can see all around themselves without turning their heads very far. This helps them watch for predators or others who would do them harm.&nbsp; However, sheep have really poor depth perception and have to stop and look at something closely to see the details.</p>
<p>Sheep have a strong herding instinct and prefer being with groups of other sheep. They learn to follow the older members of the flock when they are lambs, and their instinct is so strong that they will even follow the lead sheep over a cliff. (<a href="http://www.sheep101.info/201/behavior.html" target="_blank">http://www.sheep101.info/201/behavior.html</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheep generally have a docile or submissive nature, but they become very distressed when separated from their flock.&nbsp; They are easily frightened and tend to panic and flee from actual or perceived danger; however, they will calm down when they can maintain visual contact with other sheep. Because of this, a good shepherd will keep his or her sheep together in a flock of five or more sheep to reduce sheep stress and to more easily move them. (<a href="http://www.sheep101.info/201/behavior.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sheep101.info/201/behavior.html</a>)</p>
<p>Domesticated sheep also rely on the shepherd to take them to places of safety and good food. In Biblical times, shepherds led their sheep to sheepfolds or shelters at night to keep their sheep safe. These sheepfolds were often enclosures surrounded by walls built of stone or naturally-formed caves with an opening that could be guarded by the shepherd.</p>
<p>Domesticated sheep must be sheared of their heavy wool coats at least once a year. Shearers herd sheep together before shearing to keep them from becoming too agitated. Once a sheep is held by the shearer, however, it will often calm down and become very passive.</p>
<p>Sheep can recognize sheep faces and human faces and can also recognize human voices. They learn to respond to the voice of their own shepherd and will follow the shepherd when called. Sheep can frequently be seen following their lead sheep or their shepherd in single file fashion when moving across an open area.</p>
<p>To put my remarks into a context a little closer to home, let me introduce you to Snowy the sheep.</p>
<p>When my family and I moved to Pipiwai, New Zealand, we built a home, grew a vegetable garden and an orchard, and raised a variety of animals. We had a milk cow, chickens, goats, a turkey, an energetic and very happy dog, and six cats who lived outside and took care of the mice and rat population for us.</p>
<p>When my youngest daughter, Maraea, was ten, she decided to raise a Southdown lamb given to us by a family member. Southdown sheep are among the oldest domesticated breeds. They are a moderately-sized, mild-mannered sort of sheep who don’t need a lot of space, and because of this, they are a good breed for children to raise. (<a href="http://southdownsheep.org/breed_overview.php" target="_blank">http://southdownsheep.org/breed_overview.php</a>) Maraea wanted to raise the lamb for the local Calf Club competitions at her school.&nbsp; And so the adventures with Snowy the lamb began.</p>
<p>Calf Club Day in New Zealand is a big event. Calf Club competitions are held every year at rural schools and at regional levels to recognize the work of children in rearing healthy young farm animals. Children have to carefully feed, groom, and train their young animals in order to successfully compete in Calf Club events.</p>
<p>When Maraea started caring for Snowy, the lamb was very young, only about a month old.&nbsp; Lambs must be fed frequently, so Maraea had to bottle-feed her lamb often throughout the day.&nbsp; When she was home from school, Maraea kept the lamb by her side for much of the day. She took the lamb with her when she fed our chickens, or when she did other chores around our home.&nbsp; Maraea had to remain calm whenever she was with Snowy so that the lamb would not be frightened or upset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As Maraea will tell you, sheep are not fast learners, and training them can be a very frustrating experience. In order to teach the lamb to obey basic commands, such as coming when called, Maraea had to be very patient and spend a lot of time training Snowy every day. Maraea’s persistence, however, met with success. Snowy became very attached to her and eventually followed her everywhere. The lamb even learned to enjoy riding in the car with Maraea. She liked to sit on Maraea’s lap on the back seat so that she could look out the car window.</p>
<p>Through Maraea’s love, care, time, and attention, Snowy the lamb developed a close bond with her. When Maraea called Snowy by name, the lamb ran to her. When I called Snowy by name, the lamb completely ignored me.</p>
<p>As you can see in this photo, Snowy was a very healthy, well-cared for lamb at 4-months old when Maraea and Snowy competed in Calf Club Day at Maraea’s school. They entered several events in the competition. They won a highly commended ribbon in rearing— that’s when animals are judged on their physical conditioning and appearance. They also won the second place prize in calling—when animals are judged on their response to coming when called by their owners.&nbsp; The second place award in calling allowed Maraea and Snowy to enter regional Calf Club events. They subsequently earned the First Place award for the regional calling competition.&nbsp; It was a happy achievement for both of them.</p>
<p>In Maraea’s experiences with her lamb, she learned to do many things that are required of a good shepherd.&nbsp; As she later explained, a person who cares for sheep needs to be fully invested in all ways, emotionally and otherwise, in the well-being of the sheep, because the animal requires a lot of care and direction. Sheep are grazers and dependent on their shepherd to be led to good pasture. Maraea observed that sheep also may well be the most vulnerable and defenseless of the larger domesticated farm animals. Because sheep panic when frightened, they will not be able to find safety without assistance from the shepherd.&nbsp; Shepherds must be willing to protect and defend their flock of sheep and even put themselves in harms’ way if needed to save their sheep from danger. In order to be fed and safe, sheep must learn to trust and follow the shepherd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shepherds, in turn, rely on their sheep for their livelihood and sustenance. Maraea depended on her sheep for a little pocket money each year. She appreciated the money she earned from Snowy’s thick wool when the sheep was annually sheared.</p>
<p>In her experiences, Maraea also learned that the close bond between the shepherd and the sheep is short-lived and will not last unless the shepherd consistently nurtures the sheep. As Maraea and Snowy grew up and spent less time with each other, Maraea found that Snowy did not respond as well, sometimes refusing to come when called.</p>
<p>As Maraea learned with Snowy, it takes time and effort to for lambs to recognize and follow the voice of the shepherd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if we return to the Savior’s analogy of the Good Shepherd, we might ask what can we do to learn to better recognize the voice of our Good Shepherd?</p>
<p>One way we can effectively learn to hear the voice of the Lord is to communicate directly with the Lord through prayer.</p>
<p>Throughout the scriptures, the Lord has counseled us:</p>
<p>“And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/29.13?lang=eng#12 " target="_blank">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).</p>
<p>“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you….”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7</a>)</p>
<p>“Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good….”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.37?lang=eng#36" target="_blank">Alma 37:37</a>)</p>
<p>“Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing—yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth….”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">D&amp;C 19:38</a>)</p>
<p>As we listen for the answers to our prayers, we learn to recognize the inspiration and revelation that come to us in the voice of our Good Shepherd.</p>
<p>We have also been counseled to learn the voice and will of the Lord through scripture study.</p>
<p>Along with other prophets and Church leaders, President Ezra Taft Benson taught:</p>
<p>“I add my voice to these wise and inspired brethren and say to you that one of the most important things you can do…is to immerse yourselves in the scriptures. Search them diligently. Feast upon the words of Christ. Learn the doctrine. Master the principles that are found therein…. There are few other ways to gain greater inspiration as you serve.</p>
<p>….when individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently….Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow.”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/04/the-power-of-the-word?lang=eng&amp;query=the+power+of+the+word" target="_blank">“The Power of the Word,” Ensign, May 1986, 80–81.</a>)</p>
<p>The Savior Himself asks us to, “Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.”(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">D&amp;C 19:23</a>)</p>
<p>Our study should also extend to the messages of the Holy Prophets and modern-day revelation given through them. We live in a blessed time when we have many resources to help us know the will and word of the Lord.&nbsp; General Conference talks from the prophet and other Church leaders are readily available in multi-media formats for us to study. Church publications and videos have been designed and widely distributed for our use.&nbsp; Our Church meetings offer us gospel study to help us learn the word and will of the Lord. The Lord will hold us accountable for the knowledge that He offers to us:</p>
<p>“What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">D&amp;C 1:38</a>).</p>
<p>President Benson also warned us:</p>
<p>“…if we ignore what the Lord has given us, we may lose the very power and blessings which we seek….</p>
<p>Oh, my brethren, let us not treat lightly the great things we have received from the hand of the Lord! His word is one of the most valuable gifts He has given us. I urge you to recommit yourselves to a study of the scriptures. Immerse yourselves in them daily so you will have the power of the Spirit to attend you….”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/04/the-power-of-the-word?lang=eng&amp;query=the+power+of+the+word" target="_blank">“The Power of the Word,” Ensign, May 1986, 82</a>.)</p>
<p>When we keep the Sabbath Day holy, partake of the Sacrament, attend the temple, and obey the Lord’s commandments, we are blessed with other sacred opportunities to learn about the Savior and His will for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has also given us the charge to follow and serve Him by feeding His sheep, to be members of His flock and at the same time serve as His under-shepherds or shepherds in training. The Lord knows that when we care for each other, and help to bring others to the safety of His fold, we become more like Him. As Maraea explained from experience, a person who cares for sheep needs to be fully invested in the well-being of the sheep that requires a lot of care and direction. It can be a lot of work to take care of the Lord’s sheep. Nevertheless, in modern revelation, the Lord has told us, “…Arise…take up your cross, follow me, and feed my sheep.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">D&amp;C 112: 14</a>). He has not excused us from this responsibility.</p>
<p>In the October 2007 General Conference, Sister Silvia H. Allred, former First Counselor in the General Relief Society Presidency, asked us to,</p>
<p>“Consider the principle taught in John 21:15–17. The Lord asked Peter, ‘Lovest thou me … ?’ Peter answered, ‘Thou knowest that I love thee.’ And the Lord replied, ‘Feed my lambs.’ The Lord asked him the second time, ‘Lovest thou me?’ Peter again answered, ‘Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.’ The Lord said to Peter, ‘Feed my sheep.’ The Lord asked a third time, ‘Lovest thou me?’ Peter answered, ‘Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.’ Jesus said unto him, ‘Feed my sheep.’</p>
<p>As disciples of Christ, we too declare that we love Him. So how do we go about feeding His sheep?”<br />(<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/feed-my-sheep?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Feed My Sheep”, October 2007 General Conference</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has commanded us first to start at home, to care for His lambs in our families. In “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” we are told:</p>
<p>“Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&amp;cid=PA0414-02" target="_blank">“The Family: A Proclamation To The World”, The First Presidency of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was blessed to grow up in a home with loving parents and extended family members who were great examples for me.&nbsp; It was easy to follow them.&nbsp; My father and mother raised my sister and me with love and taught us through word and deed about service and kindness to others, the importance of hard work, and the characteristics of integrity and charity.&nbsp; I remember the times my parents opened the doors of our home as a place of safety and refuge to those in need.&nbsp; I also observed the times they spent with friends in distress, offering love, support, and counsel.</p>
<p>Some of us here today may not have this ideal at home.&nbsp; However, the Lord has provided us all with the great examples of others, righteous men and women in the scriptures, in our communities around us, and in the leadership of the Church.&nbsp; We also have the ultimate example of all righteousness, our Lord and Savior.</p>
<p>In her conference talk, Sister Allred reminded us of another important way that we feed the Lord’s sheep:</p>
<p>“One of the ways Relief Society sisters can feed His sheep is through visiting teaching. ‘The purposes of visiting teaching are to build caring relationships with each sister and to offer support, comfort, and friendship. ’Our service should be selfless, quiet, and be done willingly, with our hearts full of the love of God and His children. There must be genuine concern to shepherd the flock, to invite them unto Christ.'<br />….It is my prayer that we will pledge an increased commitment to extend our arms of love and compassion to bless, help, and strengthen each other as we go about doing our visiting teaching with a willing and joyful heart.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/feed-my-sheep?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Feed My Sheep”, October 2007 General Conference</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as Maraea’s lamb Snowy needed constant nurturing to remain close to Maraea, so we need the constant nurturing of visiting and home teaching to help us feel the love and concern of the Lord and stay close to Him.&nbsp; Visiting and home teaching are not about our guilt trips for failing to make the monthly quota.&nbsp; They are sacred responsibilities to feed and nurture the Lord’s sheep so that we all may be safe in the Lord’s fold.</p>
<p>Elder Ulisses Soares of the First Quorum of the Seventy said:</p>
<p>“To follow the Savior’s example, each one of us must look around and reach out to the sheep who are facing the same circumstances and lift them up and encourage them to proceed on the journey towards eternal life.<br />This need today is as great as or perhaps even greater than when the Savior walked on this earth. As shepherds we must understand that we should nurture each one of our sheep to bring them to Christ, which is the purpose of all we do in this Church….<br />People are most receptive to our influence when they feel that we truly love them, and not only because we have a calling to fulfill. As we express true love for people, they will be able to feel the influence of the Spirit and may feel motivated to follow our teachings.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/feed-my-sheep?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Feed My Sheep," October 2007 General Conference</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma taught the people at the Waters of Mormon about the covenant we make when we are baptized.&nbsp; He explained that if we ”are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people,” we should be “willing to bear one another’s burdens… mourn with those that mourn… comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things...that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you….” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:8-10</a>)</p>
<p>The Lord is also very concerned for His sheep that may be lost. I have always loved His parable of the lost sheep and the way the Savior emphasized the tender, loving regard He has for each one of us.</p>
<p>“And he spake this parable unto them, saying,<br />What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?<br />And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<br />And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.3-6?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Luke 15:3-6</a>)</p>
<p>This photo was taken in front of our LDS chapel in New Zealand.&nbsp; Our bishop was a shepherd by profession and loved his work in caring for these sheep and his sheep dogs that worked with him.&nbsp; As our local “good shepherd,” our bishop also exhibited many of the traits of the Savior as he led his spiritual flock.</p>
<p>As you can see in this picture, one sheep has left the flock, distracted by something interesting off to the side.&nbsp; It doesn’t look like the distraction is anything very significant; nevertheless, the sheep is no longer following the other sheep and could become lost.</p>
<p>President David O. McKay once commented,</p>
<p>“I ask you tonight, how did that sheep get lost? He was not rebellious.&nbsp; If you follow the comparison, the lamb was seeking its livelihood in a perfectly legitimate manner, but either stupidly, perhaps unconsciously, it followed the enticement of the field, the prospect of better grass until it got out beyond the fold and was lost.”&nbsp; (David O. McKay, Conference Report, April 1945, 120, as cited in Latter-Day Commentary on the New Testament, The Four Gospels, Ed J. Pinegar et al, Covenant Communications, Inc., 2002, 254)</p>
<p>So what does the Lord expect us to do to rescue His lost sheep?</p>
<p>In a General Conference, our Prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, stated the following:</p>
<p>“The Lord expects our thinking. He expects our action. He expects our labors. He expects our testimonies. He expects our devotion….<br />…we can reach out to those for whom we are responsible and bring them to the table of the Lord, there to feast on His word and to enjoy the companionship of His Spirit and be “no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2001/04/to-the-rescue?lang=eng" target="_blank">“To the Rescue," April 2001 General Conference</a>)</p>
<p>To heed the Lord’s command to feed and rescue His sheep, we need to allow the Holy Spirit to guide us in our efforts.</p>
<p>One morning soon after we first arrived in New Zealand, our shepherd bishop gave us a wild sheep. He had caught the sheep while tending to his flock in the mountains around our valley. He thought we could use the sheep as our lawnmower. I think he also wanted us to learn how to take care of a sheep as part of our new experiences living in the country.</p>
<p>Later the same day, the sheep escaped his tether in our yard, scrambled under our gate, and escaped across the nearby paddocks. The bishop, my children, and other family members in the area helped us chase after the sheep. The poor animal was very frightened.&nbsp; As the sheep tried to jump across a ditch in a field, he suddenly collapsed and died. We were very sad to lose the sheep. We couldn’t understand why the sheep died. He was healthy, and he did not suffer any injuries in his escape.</p>
<p>Our bishop explained that the sheep became so frightened and distressed that its heart broke—it basically had a massive heart attack—and the sheep died. In his experience as a shepherd, he had seen this happen before.</p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring, First Counselor in the First Presidency, stated in a General Conference talk:</p>
<p>“Our comrades are being wounded in the spiritual conflict around us. So are the people we are called to serve and protect from harm. Spiritual wounds are not easily visible, except with inspired eyes.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/man-down?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Man Down!” April 2009 General Conference</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may feel overwhelmed at times with the Savior’s charge to feed His sheep.&nbsp; It is easier to rejoice with others in their happier times, but we may feel inadequate to help those suffering from broken hearts, illness, loneliness, sadness, homesickness, culture shock, or hunger. However, the Lord has already commissioned us, blessed us, and endowed us with power to do this sacred work.</p>
<p>As He has said in modern revelation:</p>
<p>“ And that ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto me a righteous people, without spot and blameless—<br />… you shall be endowed with power from on high;<br />And from thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever I will, and no power shall stay my hand.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.31-33?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">D&amp;C 38:31-33</a>)</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, as we do what is required to recognize and listen to the Voice of the Good Shepherd, do His will, and bring others to His fold, we will be blessed beyond measure and become more like the Savior.</p>
<p>The Savior has told us:</p>
<p>“Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God….<br />And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!<br />And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!<br />Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation.<br />Ask the Father in my name in faith, believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are expedient unto the children of men.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 18:10</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.15-18?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">15-18</a>)</p>
<p>We have many wonderful examples around us of brothers and sisters feeding the Lord’s sheep. Here are a few examples that I have observed of you, the student body of this university.<br />I have seen you care for sick roommates and help them get to doctor appointments.<br />You decorate, serve, and help with transportation for student wedding receptions.<br />You teach, fellowship, and encourage Church investigators who are studying with you.<br />You mourn with those that mourn, offering many kinds of loving service for those who have lost loved ones.<br />You run fundraising events and set up websites to raise money to assist in relief efforts for countries devastated by natural disasters.<br />You serve as temple workers.</p>
<p>I’ve witnessed the same kinds of service among my colleagues, university faculty, staff, and administrators, here at the university and among extended members of our ‘ohana’ in our surrounding community. I have had the blessing of helping others in similar ways.<br />I’ve also been on the receiving end of service throughout my life—from assistance with home and family during the birth of my children—to small and random acts of kindness that have surprised and delighted me and lifted my spirits.<br />All of these kinds of service represent examples of charity, the quality of the Savior we are asked to develop in our lives on the earth.</p>
<p>Mormon teaches us:</p>
<p>“But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.<br />Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may…purified even as he is pure.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47-48?lang=eng#46" target="_blank">Moroni 7:47-48</a>)</p>
<p>The Lord teaches us in modern revelation:</p>
<p>“And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.125?lang=eng#124" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:125</a>).</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to share with you one final personal experience about feeding the Lord’s sheep.</p>
<p>This is my faculty photo composed and taken by our campus photographer, Monique Saenz, and her crew.&nbsp; I always appreciate Monique’s work.&nbsp; She makes us all look great, and in this photo I look better than I ever usually do.<br />But I’m not really showing you this photo to have you admire my looks.&nbsp; I want to share with you the backstory of this photo.</p>
<p>A short time before this faculty photo was taken, I had lost my husband to cancer, and his death left me tired, sad, and heartbroken.</p>
<p>I was serving as a counselor in our ward Relief Society presidency at the time of his death.&nbsp; One day, my Relief Society president and the other counselor in the presidency showed up at my door with a box.&nbsp; Inside the box were two beautiful dresses. I am wearing one of these dresses in this photo. I was literally clothed in charity…in the charity of these two dear sisters.</p>
<p>Because of this, the photo serves to remind me of the kindness and love of these sisters, and also of the many other acts of charity that were shown to me and my family at this difficult time. My colleagues, including faculty, staff and administrators, and students at this university, and also our extended family members in our community, helped me in so many ways, teaching my classes, visiting me and my family, providing food and service at our home, and offering kind words of love and comfort. I cannot begin to completely list all that was done in service at that time, but I remember it all, and have thanked the Lord many times for what was offered by so many.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, our lives are beautiful to the Lord.&nbsp; He knows each of us personally and acknowledges all the kind and good service we do in caring for one another.</p>
<p>May we always recognize and follow the voice of our Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Our work is not over; our efforts to love and care for one another are needed now and in whatever ways the Lord calls us to serve Him and our brothers and sisters. May we be fully invested in the care of the Lord’s sheep that we may bring souls to Him that we may truly be of one fold and one Shepherd.</p>
<p>I testify to you that the Lord is our Good Shepherd who loves us. He leads us, guides us, carries us in His arms, and desires that we come unto Him. He is the Lamb of God who was sacrificed for us through His great Atonement.&nbsp; Because of His willingness to submit to His Father’s will and to willingly lay down His life for us, we have the opportunity to repent, follow Him, become like Him, and return together to our Heavenly Father’s presence.&nbsp; May we all return safely to His fold, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015<br />Elder Stephen L. Graham<br />University Chaplain<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha my dear brothers and sisters. It’s wonderful to be with you today, in this beautiful setting. Aren’t we fortunate to live in this great day of promise—the greatest of all dispensations? I testify that the true Gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in our day, and that we are led by some of the greatest prophets and apostles who have walked the earth. I also testify that you wonderful students are among some of the most valiant of our Heavenly Father’s children whom He has reserved to come forth in these last days. I pray that we may all be taught by the Spirit as we visit about our own individual journey on this road of mortal life.</p>
<p>In Ghana, Africa, where my wife and I recently served a mission, they have a special expression when bidding farewell. &nbsp;To the person leaving they say, “Safe Journey!” That’s what I would like to express to you today:&nbsp; “Safe Journey” to all of you on this road of mortal life that we are all on! As a college freshman, many years ago, at BYU-Idaho (then known as Ricks College), I remember sitting in a meeting similar to this one and listening to a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles when he said this,</p>
<p>&nbsp;“There is an old man up there ahead of you [on this road of life] that you ought to know.<strong>…</strong> Whether he is [happy] or sad depends on you. For you made him. He is you grown older.”&nbsp; (Elder Richard L. Evans, Improvement Era, September 1969, p. 63)</p>
<p>I remember thinking to myself, “I’ll never get old!” That’s the way we feel, I guess, when we are young, but here I am! I want to visit with you about what is happening on your road of life, and share a few thoughts that may be helpful to you since we are pretty much at opposite ends of the road! The scriptures tell us that we shouted for joy when we first learned that we would have the opportunity to come to this earth and experience mortality. From where I am now at this point in my journey, I must say that it has been a marvelous experience, not without its challenges and heart-aches, but I feel like shouting for joy today because I’ve actually experienced much of the journey, rather than just anticipating it. There are five things that I would do if I were in your place near the beginning of my journey on the road of life, and I promise you that if you will do them, they will bring you great joy and satisfaction. I must add that I am far from perfect myself in these things, as my sweet companion can attest, but they will make all the difference in your life none-the-less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Always put the Lord first! &nbsp;For example:</p>
<p>Pay your tithes and offerings first, regardless, and you will always have peace of conscience and protection. You will be able to sleep at night! Speak with the Lord in prayer every day, and listen with your heart for his direction. Prayer to Father in Heaven was the mainstay, even in the life of the Savior. Read, study, and pray over the Lord’s words <em>first</em> before you read and study other things—every day—regardless—so that His words may fill your mind and heart with wisdom and good judgment, and you will always be ready to withstand worldly and secular doctrines, and not be tossed to and fro. Nephi said it so well, “… feast upon the words of Christ; for behold the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">2 Nephi 32:3</a>) &nbsp;Again, the secret behind the greatest life that has ever been lived, that of Jesus Christ, from pre-mortal realms, through mortality, and continuing into the eternities, is this very point— He always sought <em>first</em> to know the will of his Father, and then he did it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Cultivate genuine love for people!</p>
<p>Begin with your spouse, your family, then reach out every day to someone. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listen</span> to people. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Look</span> into their eyes. Seek for opportunities to serve every day. Look for someone who needs encouragement, for the one who seems lonely, and you will discover a whole new world! Never forget that every person you meet is a literal son or daughter of Heavenly Father, regardless of who they are! A prophet of God has counseled:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“On this day, mend a quarrel. Seek out a forgotten friend. Dismiss suspicion and replace it with trust. Write a letter [or an email]. Give a soft answer. Encourage youth. Manifest your loyalty in word and deed. Keep a promise. Forgo a grudge. Forgive an enemy. Apologize. Try to understand. Examine your demands on others. Think first of someone else. Be kind. Be gentle. Laugh a little more. Express your gratitude. Welcome a stranger. Gladden the heart of a child. Take pleasure in the beauty and wonder of the earth. Speak your love and then speak it again. Speak it still one more time!” (Author unknown – quoted by President Howard W. Hunter)</p>
<p>Let us follow the example of the Master who “went about doing good” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">Acts 10:38</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Seek to enjoy daily the fruits of the Spirit!</p>
<p>The Gift of the Holy Ghost is probably the greatest gift that God can give to mortal man. As you know, through Him we can be taught, comforted, guided, be given power, and be cleansed and purified from sin and all unrighteousness, just to name a few. What a marvelous gift! The Savior instructed His disciples thus:</p>
<p>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">John 14:26</a>)</p>
<p>Wilford Woodruff, fourth president of the Church, recounts the following experience, which occurred in the 1890s, over a hundred years ago. They were traveling in the southern part of the state of Utah by horse and buggy—there were no trains or airplanes in those days:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"During my travels in the southern country last winter I had many interviews with President [Brigham] Young and with Heber C. Kimball, and Geo. A. Smith, and Jedediah M. Grant, and many others who are dead. They attended our conference, they attended our meetings. And on one occasion, I saw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in a carriage ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to attend conference; and they were dressed in the most priestly robes. When we arrived at our destination I asked President Young if he would preach to us. He said, 'No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh, I shall not talk to this people any more. But (said he) I have come to see you; I have come to watch over you, and to see what the people are doing. Then (said he) I want you to teach the people—and I want you to follow this counsel yourself—that they must labor and so live as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the kingdom; without the Spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles and as elders in the church and kingdom of God.'" (Wilford Woodruff, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, vol. 21, 318 – General Conference – 10 October 1880)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Keep a record!</p>
<p>Keep a record of those moments when you see the hand of the Lord in your life, with all of His tender mercies toward you, and ponder it continually in your heart. Mortal life is like climbing a mountain. It is hard work and makes us sweat, especially in the heat of the day when we face the difficult challenges and discouraging moments. It is, therefore, very important for each of us to stop now and then and turn and enjoy the panoramic view and the satisfaction that comes from seeing where we have been, and how far we have actually come—to take counsel from our strengths and accomplishments, and especially in seeing the hand of the Lord in our lives.&nbsp; I know for me personally I often see the hand of the Lord more readily when I look back than when I look forward, or even at the present moment. When I look back I often think “Oh my goodness, why didn’t I recognize that?”</p>
<p>If we don’t keep a record, we lose sight of, and forget, these wonderful treasures. There are few things in life that are more satisfying than to know what your true purpose and destiny are, and to be able to look back as well as forward, and see your life unfolding as you know it should. In the words of Moroni, “…I would exhort you …that ye would remember how merciful the Lord has been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder<em> it </em>[emphasis added] in your hearts.”&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Moroni 10:3</a>) &nbsp;If we don’t record them, we lose track of them.&nbsp; If we record them and ponder on them, they build and strength us. &nbsp;Again in the words of Alma,&nbsp; “…I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Alma 38:5</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Go the second mile!</p>
<p>I want to share a story with you that you are all pretty much familiar with, but this time I want you to become part of the story, if you don’t mind. Imagine the following:<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span></p>
<p>Imagine that you live at the time of Christ. You work in the city of Jerusalem but live four miles outside the city, and so you have to walk to and from the city every day. You also understand that it is the law that when any citizen of Palestine, which you are, meets a Roman Soldier, and there are plenty of them around, that he can legitimately compel you, the citizen, to carry his belongings for one mile, regardless of where you are or in what direction you may be going.&nbsp; So, here is the scenario that I want you to picture in your mind: Are you ready?</p>
<p>It is Friday afternoon at the end of a long week of work. You are tired and anxious to get home. You decide to stop at the market before you leave the city, to pick up a few food items. You do so and put them in a sack, and fling it over your shoulder. As you go out of the city gate and begin your journey home, you have this feeling come over you—that just because it’s Friday and just because you are tired, and just because you have four miles to walk, it is going to be just your luck to run into a Roman soldier on the way home. Do you ever get those kinds of feelings, that just because of how things have been going on a particular day, something crazy is going to happen? You just know it!&nbsp; Well, that’s the way you are feeling today. You walk a couple of miles. It’s dusty and hot. The bag over your shoulder is kind of heavy, and you can’t wait to get home, get a cold drink, and put your feet up to rest. You keep walking and you begin thinking, “Oh, I’ve come over two miles already! Maybe I’ll be lucky after all. Maybe that was just one of those crazy thoughts I get because I am tired!” Then you see an object off in the distance on the road. You can’t tell exactly what it is, but you keep walking, hoping that it isn’t what you think it is. As it gets closer you can see that it is clearly a Roman soldier, and he’s a big one! You keep walking on the opposite side of the road from him, of course, and look down at the road pretending not to notice him. But, you know that he is looking right at you, and you know exactly what he is going to ask you to do! Finally you can see his feet. You pretend not to see him, then you hear a big voice roar at you, “You—come and carry my stuff!” You have only a half mile to go before you get home, and he is going the other way! He has a huge metal shield and heavy iron sword, plus a large sack on his back, and he throws them down in the dust at your feet! Of course you don’t want to leave your own sack at the side of the road, so you have both his things and your sack to carry! Picture yourself picking up his sword and shield, and his sack, as well as your sack, and trying to get them situated on your shoulders. This isn’t going to be easy. Now, brothers and sisters, would you mind closing your eyes and picturing yourself walking with the soldier while I ask you some questions about how you might be feeling as you make this journey? Would you do that?</p>
<p>You begin walking—just picture it in your mind. Question: Who is in control in this situation? What might be some of your thoughts and feelings toward the soldier as you walk? We all know how anger, frustration and resentment can build up within us at moments like these.&nbsp; Another question:&nbsp; Where would you walk—beside him, in front of him, behind him—and why? Would you be talking with him? Would there be any conversation at all between you? Now, after walking for some time lost in your thoughts and feelings, you notice the mile marker is coming up on your right. There is just a short distance to go to complete your obligation to him, and he cannot force you to go any further! But then you have this crazy thought come into your mind and heart—“I think I’ll go another mile, just to see what happens!” And the more you think about It, the more excited you become. Your heart begins to beat faster within you. You get a big smile on your face. Your step quickens, and you feel new energy flow into you; you can’t wait to step across that line! Now you’ve had these kinds of thoughts and experiences haven’t you—to go an extra mile, to do something good that no one is expecting you to do? It’s so fun!&nbsp; You decide that you won’t say anything; unless he asks, you will just keep going! Joy fills your heart. This is one of the most exciting moments you’ve had recently! At the very moment you step across the line into the second mile, everything changes! He stops in his tracks with a look of unbelief on his face, and yells, “Hey you, what are you doing?” You look back at him, and tell him you just decided to go a little further with him, and turn and keep going. He starts to follow you; he actually hurries to catch up with you and walks beside you. He then stops you—puts his hand on your shoulder and looks you in the eye—he wants to know why you are doing such a crazy thing? Yes—things are very different now in this second mile—you are now in control—and you now have great opportunities and privileges that you didn’t have before during the first mile!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters (you can open your eyes now), the moment we step across the line into the second mile in living the gospel of Jesus Christ, everything changes from what it was during the first mile. The biggest change will probably be within us, but it can also have a powerful ripple effect in the lives of those around us. Some of the sweetest, most delicious, and greatest blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ are found only in the second mile, but we have to go the first mile in order to get into the second. The Lord has counseled us:</p>
<p>“For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</p>
<p>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</p>
<p>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</p>
<p>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.“ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26-29?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">D&amp;C 58:26-29</a>)</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, as you spend your time here, and then leave this university and go back out into the world, the Lord is counting on you to be pro-active—to initiate righteousness, to be a righteous and powerful force in accomplishing much good, and much righteousness, and many wonderful things—without having to be told!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ must be our model on this road of life! It is extremely important that He be on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> road, and on mine! He it is who calls to us to “come follow him”, and He is the only one who can really show us the way! He is the one on whom we must keep the “affections of our hearts” and our full attention focused (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.36?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">Alma 37:36</a>). He is our friend; He should be our best friend!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This beloved hymn expresses it so well:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abide with me; ‘tis eventide.</p>
<p>The day is past and gone;</p>
<p>The night is coming on.</p>
<p>Within my heart a welcome guest,</p>
<p>Within my home abide.</p>
<p>Thy walk today with me</p>
<p>Has made my heart within me burn,</p>
<p>As I communed with thee.</p>
<p>Thy earnest words have filled my soul,</p>
<p>And kept me near thy side.</p>
<p>And lone will be the night</p>
<p>If I cannot commune with thee</p>
<p>Nor find in thee my light.</p>
<p>The darkness of the world, I fear,</p>
<p>Would in my home abide.</p>
<p>O Savior, stay this night with me;</p>
<p>Behold, ’tis eventide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He beckons to us—to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> and to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>—to study his words diligently—to honestly and sincerely make and keep sacred covenants with him, and follow his example in word, in thought, and in deed. In Book of Mormon language, we must “feast upon the words of Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">2 Ne. 32:3</a>), “talk of Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">2 Ne. 25:26</a>), “rejoice in Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">2 Ne. 25:26</a>), “[be] made alive in Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.25?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">2 Ne. 25:25</a>), “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny [ourselves] of all ungodliness…and love God with all [our] might, mind and strength, then [will] his grace [be] sufficient for [us], that by his grace [we] may be perfect in Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Moroni 10:32</a>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we again ask the question: Where will you be in ten years, or twenty? Remember that there are many things in this life over which you will have little or no control at all (for example; health problems, economic conditions, political affairs, the weather, and natural disasters to name a few), but fortunately you do have complete control over the eternal things—the things that matter most.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>You can decide today that for the rest of your life you will be at the sacrament table every Sunday worthily partaking of the sacrament. Isn’t that wonderful? You can decide that today!</p>
<p>You can decide today that thirty years from now, you will still be a worthy holder of a temple recommend, and still be using it as often as your circumstances will allow.</p>
<p>You can decide today to be happy—to radiate the joy of the gospel—regardless of your circumstances! And in doing so, I testify that you will find that the Savior will support and sustain you! One of the most important themes of His life was, “…be of good cheer; I have overcome the world!” (John 16:33)</p>
<p>You and I can decide these eternal things today, and, if I were you, I would do so!</p>
<p>An apostle of the Lord once wisely said, “There is no road that is too long or too difficult if it is the right road. And there is no journey that is satisfying, no matter how easy or short, or even how long it may be, if it is a journey on the wrong road. Consult the Spirit which our Father in Heaven has placed within each of you for your guidance and direction if you will heed it. Cultivate it and listen to it. Don’t try to tell the Spirit within what you think it ought to want you to do, but listen to it and let it tell you what you know you ought to do.” (Richard L. Evans, <em>The Man and the Message</em> [1973], p187)</p>
<p>Let us never forget that all of these wonderful, eternal blessings are possible only because our Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ was willing to perform the infinite and eternal Atonement in our behalf!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love Him, and I testify of the reality of His existence. I testify as well that he loves you—each and every one of you—and as He has promised, He will draw near unto you as you draw near unto Him! (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/4.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">James 4:8</a>;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63?lang=eng#62" target="_blank"> D&amp;C 88:63</a>)</p>
<p>May we all,      through sincere, heart-felt prayer, the study of His word, and our complete      obedience, come to know Him better than we ever have before, is my humble      prayer for all of us. In his sacred name, even Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>April 28, 2015<br />Daniel Bradshaw<br />Department Chair, Music and Theatre Arts<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear sisters and brothers, I am honored to address you and pray the spirit may be with you and me as we spend a few minutes together today. Thanks to Emily for the kind introduction. I’ll talk more about her later. I will only say of her now what Joseph Smith said of Emma: “I would go to hell for such a woman.” (<em>Joseph Smith, the Prophet</em>, Truman G. Madsen, 1989) She would be worth the journey. Thanks to Mike Belnap and Stacy McCarrey for the music and to all who have made their usual but unseen efforts to make this devotional an uplifting experience; lighting and sound engineers, setup crews, power-point display preparers, secretaries, camera &amp; production crews. These devotionals are a team effort.</p>
<p>In my almost nine years in this community, I have grown to appreciate the Polynesian way of introducing oneself, and I would like to follow it here. I am Daniel Bradshaw, son of Merrill and Janet Bradshaw. My father comes from the Bradshaws of Lancashire, England. His great, great grandfather, John, immigrated to the US when he converted to the gospel in the 1850s. My mother’s family also comes from England and Ireland, and each line has its own story of immigration upon hearing the gospel preached by the early LDS missionaries. I am grateful for this British Isle heritage. I honor the lives of my faithful ancestors and recognize that much of the ease and many of the opportunities I enjoy in my life are a direct result of their faith, and sacrifice. I also wish to recognize the sacrifice of so many saints, labor missionaries, visionaries and community members in the building and maintenance of this unique university, whose labors allow us to meet together today, and whose sacrifices make our spiritual and secular learning possible. What a beautiful thing that we are all bound together by the faith and sacrifice of previous generations! May we be ever mindful of this fact. It is in this spirit, bound by our common gratitude to those who have come before, and by our common debt to God and His Son, that I say: brothers and sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>I want to start today by asking a simple question: Is the world good or bad? Whatever your immediate thoughts might be, you are bound to quickly recognize that the answer may not be simple. The world, of course, has both good and bad in it, even evil if you prefer that term. What’s more, “the world” is a fuzzy term that can mean a number of different things. But I think you know what I mean. Is the world good or bad? Is it good with bad things in it, or is it bad with good things in it? As Alan Keele recognized in his 1996 BYU Devotional address, this is a bit like asking if a Zebra is black with white stripes or white with black stripes. And does it really matter? Either way, both good and bad are with us daily, and how we perceive them won’t change the way the world is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Or will it?</p>
<p>I think this question is an important one for how we perceive the world and how we perceive life itself. Is life a hardship to be born with occasional moments of happiness? Or is it essentially good with some moments of difficulty? Is it a necessary evil to be endured before landing in paradise for eternity, or a beautiful, rich experience designed for our benefit and enjoyment? How we view these questions has a bearing on how we treat others in the world, how we go about learning and experiencing new things, and how we perceive our place in the world as Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>In our normal discourse, our treatment of the world is not kind. Most often, “the world” is another name for “sin.” Jesus says, “I am not of the world” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">John 17:14</a>) and John follows with, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">1 John 2:15</a>). We are to be <em>in</em> the world, but not <em>of</em> the world. It’s a dirty substance we need to avoid.</p>
<p>And yet, we are all here, in the world, surrounded by sin. And some of us aren’t perfect ourselves.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a poem by Frank O’Hara, called “Song.” I think it has something to say about our question.</p>
<p>Song by Frank O’Hara</p>
<p>Is it dirty<br /> does it look dirty<br /> that's what you think of in the city<br /> <br /> does it just seem dirty<br /> that's what you think of in the city<br /> you don't refuse to breathe do you<br /> <br /> someone comes along with a very bad character<br /> he seems attractive. is he really. yes. very<br /> he's attractive as his character is bad. is it. yes<br /> <br /> that's what you think of in the city<br /> run your finger along your no-moss mind<br /> that's not a thought that's soot<br /> <br /> and you take a lot of dirt off someone<br /> is the character less bad. no. it improves constantly<br /> you don't refuse to breathe do you</p>
<p>What does this poem say to you? What does it say about the world? Is it dirty? Using the city as a metaphor for the world, I think we would have to say, yes! The city is dirty. The world is dirty. And yet, here we are. You don’t refuse to breathe, do you? This poem beautifully articulates the paradox of living in a dirty world. We all cringe at the grime, yet none of us are above breathing. And, lest any of us think we are squeaky clean, O’Hara asks us to run our finger along our “no-moss” mind, only to find soot! We are dirty! I’m delighted by the down-to-earth way he puts us in our place.</p>
<p>Let me pause here to say, I understand that there are things we don’t want or need in our lives. I take seriously the admonition to “touch not the unclean thing.” If the world we’re talking about is sin, then unquestioningly, we should avoid and shun it. Sin is an empty bag. It looks appealing but yields no bounty. What I am talking about is the world that we more often live in, where people, thoughts, theories, etc., are neither expressly sinful, nor expressly scriptural. This is the land where we are to exercise our best judgment to discern what is good, true, right and what is false, fleeting or deceitful. In this land of agency, we need to decide if it’s dirty, and whether or not to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>The Good World</strong></p>
<p>But we haven’t really answered our question. Is the world good or bad? Well, yes! Both are true, depending on how we see things. But will we choose to see it as primarily bad or good?</p>
<p>To that end, I’d like to invoke an analogy of tree skiing.</p>
<p>When you first look at this picture, what do you see? Trees! Trees everywhere!! How could anyone make it down that mountain without running into a few trees? Tree skiing is a potentially dangerous activity, but I can say from experience, that it can also be incredibly fulfilling. One of the tricks any tree skier has to learn is to focus on the space between the trees. If you focus on the tree itself, you usually end up running right into it. Your skis tend to follow your eyes. Your focus determines where your skis will go. As you continually look to the next space between the trees, you find you are able to make your way down, and the way seems to open up where there seemed to be no way before. As you focus on what artists would call the negative space, you find there is actually a lot of room for skiing and for having a great time while you’re doing it.</p>
<p>Now, tree skiing takes some skill. I probably wouldn’t take my kids down this run here. But as they gain confidence and experience, I might take them down it some day.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think that you as university students are skillful enough to handle some tree skiing. I think that your spiritual maturity and your intellectual acuity have progressed to engage in the fulfilling activity of tree skiing. You are poised to navigate the world of ideas in a safe and enjoyable way.</p>
<p>You may have already recognized a key point of my metaphor: the world is good. Yes, there are lots of trees and plenty of dangers associated with them, but there is also plenty of space between the trees! The opportunity for a fulfilling life awaits you! The world is good!</p>
<p>How can I say this? Let’s start with a very important scripture, which Prof. Ned Williams pointed out to me a while ago:</p>
<p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/3.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">John 3:16</a>)</p>
<p>If that’s not proof enough for you, I’m not sure what to say. God loves the world. He cares about it deeply. He rejoices in its beauty and weeps when it is abused. This is true whether you think of it as the physical earth, or the people who inhabit it. He loves the world. He wants us, even commands us, to learn about it in every respect. Listen to this list and just try to tell me your major isn’t included in these verses from <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.78-80?lang=eng#77" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:&nbsp;78-80</a>,</p>
<p>“Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in…all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand; …things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms—That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the…mission with which I have commissioned you.”</p>
<p>This university is a tangible attempt to fulfill this commandment. God loves the world and wants us to share his joy by learning about it. And by learning about it, we are better able to magnify our roles in his kingdom. Did you ever notice that about this scripture? To be sure, we need to be rooted in gospel truths, but this verse plainly states that learning about the world prepares us for our gospel missions. In one interpretation of this phenomenon, there is hard data to back this assertion up. People who receive degrees from LDS institutions of higher learning are far more likely to stay active and contribute to the church for the long term. Their education helps them to stay active in the church. This has been verified by actual research.</p>
<p>But I think there is another, broader interpretation of this phenomenon which is astoundingly far-reaching. Who can calculate the number of conversations that have turned away from ignorance or offense because of a university education? How many would-be enemies of the church have been treated with dignity and respect because they were understood by a dedicated student? How many doors have been opened because LDS members had taken the Lord’s admonition to learn seriously? I sense that if we could gather and view this data, it would be a jaw-dropping experience. The implied effect of learning about the world is that we are better able to understand it, perhaps even invite it in as a friend. Education tends toward understanding, where ignorance tends toward fear and alienation.</p>
<p>My metaphor of tree skiing isn’t really unique. It’s quite like Lehi’s dream and the mists of darkness. Lehi’s dream is probably better because of one important aspect: the rod of iron. Lehi sees that only those who cling to the rod of iron make it through the mists of darkness to partake of the precious fruit (notice the intensity of that word—clinging! With both hands, I presume).</p>
<p>This vision also holds meaning for our discussion today. Have you ever been in thick fog? Or anything close to Lehi’s mists of darkness? I remember one day when I was about 10 years old. I was walking to school in the thickest fog I had ever seen. You couldn’t see more than ten yards ahead. It was magical, but a bit unnerving. Objects or people in the distance first appeared as mysterious, even menacing forms. But as I came closer to them, I began to see them for what they actually were and my fears subsided.</p>
<p>The world, shrouded in mists of darkness, can be a similar experience for us. I’m speaking here about your education, your way of confronting or interfacing with the world. As you come to see new ideas, they may at first be mysterious or menacing, especially if they seem to conflict with your accepted beliefs. But often, as you come closer to them and study them (while still clinging to the rod of iron), you may find they are not so threatening as they first seemed. You may learn as Nephi did, that to be learned is good.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at this oft-quoted phrase.</p>
<p>“To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.29?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:29</a>)</p>
<p>This follows a scathing critique of the learned, who suppose they know of themselves. Consequently, this verse is often turned to mean: beware of the learned! Shun worldly learning—it’s just too dangerous to risk!</p>
<p>However, I’ve just quoted the Lord’s admonition for us to be learned. He wants us to be learned. And if we are earnestly striving to do what’s right, to stay close to the Lord, to listen to the Spirit and heed its promptings; in other words, “If we hearken to the counsels of God,” then…“to be learned <em>is</em> <em>good</em>!” As long as we humble ourselves before the Lord, then…“to be learned <em>is</em> <em>good</em>!” As long as we try to live out our covenants, then…“to be learned <em>is</em> <em>good</em>!”</p>
<p><strong>The World is Charged with Glory of God</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, we’ve established that learning about the world helps us to magnify our gospel mission. I now want to reverse that sentence: learning about the gospel helps us to magnify the world. Which is to say, to see it for what it truly is. Here I quote a Catholic Monk, Thomas Merton:</p>
<p>“Every word that comes from the mouth of God is nourishment that feeds the soul with eternal life . . . By the reading of Scripture I am so renewed that all nature seems renewed around me and with me. The sky seems to be a pure, a cooler blue, the trees a deeper green, light is sharper on the outlines of the forest and the hills and the whole world is charged with the glory of God and I feel fire and music in the earth under my feet.” (<em>Thomas Merton, Master of Attention</em> by Robert Waldron. Paulist Press, 2008)</p>
<p>Have you ever heard a better explanation of why we need to immerse ourselves in the scriptures? We become more aware of things as they really are. Light is sharper, trees are greener. I will add that I notice a greater measure of patience with my children, more measured reactions to things that don’t go my way, when I study the scriptures. The world, I finally understand, is not set against me. In fact I feel a kinship with the world, my fellow beings, even all creation. I feel fire and music in the earth under my feet. In short, the world is charged with the glory of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Charged” is a wonderfully peculiar word. In our day, the image of a cell phone immediately comes to mind. Envisioning the world humming, full of electricity, vibrating to capacity with the life of charged particles is a fulfilling image for the way God’s glory infuses the world. But I want to take this image to its source, which is a poem by Gerard Hopkins, who lived in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century before the advent of electricity. He was likely acquainted with the word in a different context, as Webster’s dictionary tells us:</p>
<p>charge</p>
<p><em>verb</em></p>
<p><em>(1)</em> <strong>:</strong>&nbsp; to place a charge (as of powder) in</p>
<p><em>(2)</em> <strong>:</strong>&nbsp; to load or fill to capacity</p>
<p>Whether the world is ready to explode with God’s glory, or whether the world is filled to capacity with it, either definition gives wonderful meaning to the word, seen here in Hopkin’s original poem:</p>
<p>THE WORD is charged with the grandeur of God.</p>
<p>It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;</p>
<p>It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil</p>
<p>Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?</p>
<p>Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;</p>
<p>And all is seared with trade, bleared, smeared with toil;</p>
<p>And wears man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the soil</p>
<p>is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for all this, nature is never spent;</p>
<p>There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;</p>
<p>And though the last lights off the black West went</p>
<p>Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs––</p>
<p>Because the Holy Ghost over the bent</p>
<p>World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This poem is charged with too much meaning for me to share in this setting, but I wanted to point out three things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Doubt</strong></p>
<p>So far, everything is good. The world is good, and to be learned is good. But what happens when you’re learning about the world, and you confront something that causes you to doubt—doubt your previously held knowledge or assumptions, or even to doubt your testimony? This is a serious question. And it’s bound to happen. As our knowledge expands, it inevitably exposes new areas of ignorance. With any deep learning, we begin to realize how little we know! This may cause us to doubt, but it doesn’t have to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t think that this kind of not-knowing is, in itself, a failure. I think it’s just life. And, as Mormons, we can’t hide from this not-knowing, because, more than anything else, Mormonism is a way of living rather than dodging life. Part of not dodging life is owning this ignorance.” (<em>Letters to a Young Mormon</em>, Adam S. Miller, Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, 2014)</p>
<p>If this not-knowing is a problem for your testimony, you may want to rethink your approach. If your faith is built on the water-tight idea that you have all the answers, there’s bound to be a serious leak at some point. A far healthier approach is, as Adam Miller advocates, to own your ignorance. Admit you don’t know. This doesn’t mean to doubt your faith. On the contrary! Owning ignorance allows you to trust in your faith, which is based in belief, not knowing. Just be honest and humble enough to realize your own limitations. This can be liberating, and it need not lead us to doubt.</p>
<p>But if new ideas do cause you to doubt your faith, take care, especially if you find yourself leading with your unbelief, as <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe?lang=eng" target="_blank">Elder Holland</a> observes:</p>
<p>“When those moments come and issues surface, the resolution of which is not immediately forthcoming,&nbsp;<em>hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When problems come and questions arise, do not start your quest for faith by saying how much you do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;have, leading as it were with your “unbelief.” That is like trying to stuff a turkey through the beak! Let me be clear on this point: I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;asking you to be true to the faith you <em>do</em>&nbsp;have.”<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I love this man and his faithful counsel: hold fast to the faith you do have. Lead with your belief. When difficult things come in life, say first, “Lord, I believe.” And only then, “help thou mine unbelief.”</p>
<p>However, I would also like to point out that doubt does not have to be a bad thing. It may be a natural part of the learning process. Briefly consider two episodes from the life of Peter.</p>
<p>First, when he asks Christ to bid him walk on the water. He displays extraordinary faith in getting out of the boat and walking on the water, completely trusting in Christ’s power to hold him up. Yet he doubts when he sees the waves boisterous, and as he doubts, he sinks, and is only saved by the Lord grabbing him by the hand. Jesus clearly chastises this kind of doubt: “O ye of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” The moral of the story? Don’t doubt the Lord’s power.</p>
<p>Second, when Peter has the great vision leading to the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles. After seeing a great sheet full of “wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air,” he hears a voice: “Rise, Peter, kill and eat!” This is a strange vision indeed, so it’s no wonder that as the vision leaves him, “Peter doubted in himself what this vision…should mean.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/10.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Acts 10:1</a>7) This sort of doubt seems to be okay. Peter is no longer questioning the Lord’s power, but how he should interpret his newfound knowledge. This kind of doubt has the same spirit of inquiry that Mary has as she ponders things in her heart, or that Enoch has when he questions, “how is it thou canst weep?” or that Moses has, when he proclaims, “For this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.” In each case, there are doubts about how they should understand some new idea. In Mary’s case, she may have pondered years before understanding came. Yet her faith and patience in spite of her questions are exactly the qualities I would like to advance today. Her patient questioning and pondering is what I imagine Dostoevsky speaks of when he says,</p>
<p>“It is not like a child that I believe in Christ and profess faith in him, but rather, my <em>hosanna </em>has come through the great <em>crucible of doubt</em>.” (Fyodor Dostoevsky, <em>The Unpublished Dostoevsky: Diaris and Notebooks</em>, Ann Arbor: Ardis, 1976), 175.</p>
<p>When endured faithfully, leading with belief, clinging to the word of God, our experiences with doubt can actually purify and strengthen our faith.</p>
<p>Now, I want to share with you two stories about drool. Yes, drool.</p>
<p>Story Number One:</p>
<p>This was an idyllic day. I had taken my four-month-old baby, Quinn, out for a stroll one beautiful December day. With my hand on his back to steady him, I sat him on the ground and allowed him to feel the blades of green grass for himself, perhaps for the first time. As he became engrossed with the feel of the lawn, he leaned forward, and a strand of drool stretched from his mouth to the grass, briefly connecting him with this new-found mystery. In that moment, my mind became aware of the sky above us, the wind in the trees, and this strand of drool was a visible symbol of my son’s connection to all of creation, he being a visual manifestation of God’s grace himself. I felt the beauty of creation all around me and my own connection to God through this creation, including my son, Quinn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Story Number Two:</p>
<p>This was a very serious day. I was driving my wife, Emily, to the hospital as quickly and safely as I could. She had had a miscarriage which was hard enough to bear, but now she was in serious trouble, shaking from loss of blood. As I wheeled her into the Emergency Room, she went into shock, filled with panic and a sense of doom. Of course the medical staff tried to calm her down, but only after she had been on an IV for a few minutes and replaced some of her lost fluids did she return to her normal self. I was seriously concerned for her. After a couple of hours, when she had a chance to rest and was looking much better, and after many assurances that she felt well enough to stand, she needed to be helped to the bathroom. She stepped into a wheelchair and I rolled her into the restroom around the corner. I stayed to steady her, which was a good thing, because as she got up, her forehead resting on my shoulder, she fainted. Somehow, I was able to keep her knees from buckling. As her head rested on me, her weight and mine teetering in a delicate balance, I tried to reach for the red emergency cord to signal the hospital staff for help. I couldn’t reach it. Finally, after some careful maneuvering of Emily’s useless limbs, I reached and pulled the cord and waited. There was no response. No bell, no buzzer…nothing. Even after an extremely long minute, no one had come. We were completely alone and Emily’s strength was spent.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized that this was a tangible representation of our struggle for the past few years to have a baby: both of us yearning and praying, pulling on the spiritual emergency cord, hoping that some divine help would come to our aid. There were times when we felt completely alone. I thought of the many nights of tears, of difficult decisions about which medical avenue to pursue next, of the many priesthood blessings that made promises yet unfulfilled.</p>
<p>At this moment, in Emily’s unconscious state, a long string of drool fell from her mouth to the cold tile floor. In this moment that could have easily been filled with panic, I had a moment of reverence for the sacrifice of my wife. She was utterly spent. She had exerted every ounce of physical, mental and spiritual energy in her attempt to follow a prompting from the Spirit that we would have another child. I was awed by her diligence and perseverance, by her faith that stayed strong despite times of doubt, grief, and consternation at why promised blessings refused to come. These thoughts came quickly, powerfully and calmly to me as I stood, paralyzed by my vanishing options. Eventually, I managed to pick her up and carry her back to her room. But it was amazing to me at the time, and still is, that this moment, of all the things it could have been, was a moment that became precious, even sacred to me. It was, surprisingly, charged with God’s grandeur. In what may have been our moment of greatest defeat (remember that meaning of “foil?”), inspiration flamed out, like shining from shook foil.</p>
<p>This trial of our faith continues to flame out in our lives. It continues to enlighten our understanding.</p>
<p>We value and cherish the life of our new child (yes, priesthood promises were eventually fulfilled) more than we ever could before our souls had been stretched and hollowed by the waiting and wanting. In fact, though we still stumble as parents, we cherish all of our children more, as well as our relationship as integral parts of an eternal family.</p>
<p>Our connection to God is tempered by our experience. When nothing seemed to be going our way, we learned more about patience and faithfulness. We felt to say often, “Lord, I believe. Help Thou my unbelief!” And there were times when I appreciated Job’s declaration, “Though God slay me, yet will I trust in him.” We also have a greater capacity for empathy for the trials of others, especially for the pain of miscarriage or infertility which, although not uncommon, often goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>And let me remark at this point, that there are those whose story ends differently than ours does. Some must continue to wait. Some may never have the child they desire. Some may adopt. Others may not. There are as many different stories as there are people who live them, and there are myriad ways to be faithful as we live through our trials. May we be sensitive to the hidden stories of others as we interact with those around us.</p>
<p>So, there you have it: two stories of drool. The story of my boy on the grass symbolizing our connection through God’s creation, the other indicating our connection through life’s harrowing experiences. To me, both stories are a manifestation of a loving father’s attempt to connect with his children, to draw them close, to exalt them, to broaden their faith and experience. And, both stories are a manifestation of “the world.” The world as creation, and the world as our (sometimes difficult) life experience.</p>
<p>I want to end with the Hawaiian myth of Hāloa. Emily and I happened upon this myth on a hike to Waimea Falls a few years ago. Because it was not long after a miscarriage, it spoke to both of us deeply. It is the legend of Taro.</p>
<p>Wākea (Father Heaven) and Ho’ohokukalai (the stars) had a child and named him Hāloa, but he was stillborn. They buried the infant in front of their house and a taro plant grew from it, watered by the mother’s tears. Later, when another child was born, also named Hāloa, he was nourished with the taro plant and grew to be strong, even the principal ancestor of the Hawaiian people, now symbolized by the taro plant.</p>
<p>I know of no better illustration than this story of how our difficult experiences may bloom into life-sustaining nourishment. This is why our son now bears the name Quinn Hāloa Bradshaw, so that we (and eventually he) will remember this special truth.</p>
<p>Sisters, brothers, my message today is simple. This life, this world, is precious. The experience and learning we gain here is invaluable. Since our perceptions matter, I hope you will remember that this world is a manifestation of a caring Father’s love, of his wise purposes, of his desire to share joy with his children not just in the eternities, but here and now. I hope that as you go about your studies this semester, and as you move into life beyond your university experience, that you may remember this important reality: that the world is charged with the glory of God. And that as you seek learning in the gospel and in the world and in your own life experiences, you will feel fire and music in the earth under your feet. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
