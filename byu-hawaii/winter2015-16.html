<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #262626;">I was on a Church assignment in Hong Kong in 1996 (before many of you were born). I was attending the Hong Kong temple dedication -- what would be the first temple in China. The day before the dedicatory sessions I was sitting in a missionary meeting at the back of a chapel with rows of elders and sisters filling the room.</span><span style="color: #262626;">&nbsp; </span><span style="color: #262626;">I was there just as an observer, waiting to hear President Gordon B. Hinckley and President Thomas S. Monson address the young missionaries. As the two came in the door everyone stood in quiet reverence.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">But I wasn’t expecting what came next. A powerful spiritual manifestation came over me as President Monson strode down the aisle, his broad smile and his 6 foot three frame a commanding presence.&nbsp; At that moment I was filled with the pure knowledge that he was called of God, a prophet for our time.&nbsp; And then the spirit confirmed to me that he would someday lead the Church.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">There was nothing special about me. I knew President Monson only by his messages at General Conference and I wondered why the Lord had given me such a profound witness. Indeed, I felt like Jacob who wrote, “I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, . . . wherefore I could not be shaken.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn1"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[i]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">It would be years before that singular moment in time would make sense to me.&nbsp; I was in England, serving with my husband who was President of the England London South Mission.&nbsp; It was June 18, 2008 – you know how events are imprinted in your mind and in your heart; this was one of those. I was in the kitchen doing what every good mission mother does, I was making cookies when my husband came into the room and said the phone was for me. The phone was never for me.&nbsp; We didn’t even have a phone in the kitchen.&nbsp; I only got phone calls if it was some poor missionary who had just gotten dumped by his girlfriend back home.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">He continued rather seriously, “Heidi, it’s President Monson.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I said quickly, “What missionary thinks that’s funny.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then he soberly said, “It really is President Monson and he wants to talk to you.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">All I could think of was “What have I done?”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I picked up the phone with some trepidation and said with a tremor in my voice, “Hello.”&nbsp; On the other end of the line came that all familiar voice we know from the pulpit, “Heidi, how are you?”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I thought to myself, “I don’t know. How am I?”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson then began to chat.&nbsp; That’s what he does.&nbsp; He reaches into your heart and finds a spot and settles in speaking with genuine interest.&nbsp; It’s like he is pulling a chair up to the kitchen table and saying, “How are you today?”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;">After more than 30 minutes of chatting, me terrified the whole time, he explained that he had pondered and prayed and he wanted me to write his biography.</span><span style="color: #262626;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I remember asking him one day, “President, why did you ask me to write your life story?&nbsp; I was not in your inner circle.” He responded immediately, “There are 14 million in my inner circle and you are one of them.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">And so the next two and a half years, one of them while I was on the mission, I worked at shaping his life into a narrative for you and everyone else to read. He had only been the prophet for a few months when I began.&nbsp; We needed to know him, to learn from him as we follow him, the sixteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think of the song “We Thank Thee, Oh God, for a Prophet” but it’s the next line that makes so much difference.&nbsp; “To guide us in these latter days”.&nbsp; Following a prophet requires trust.&nbsp; We must trust that he listens to the Lord and speaks for the Lord. Recall the words from the Doctrine and Covenants, “Whether by mine own voice or the voice of my servants it is the same.” Do you trust the prophet of God and those apostles who work at his side? Do you listen to their counsel and then act accordingly? Or are you casual, sometimes cavalier, choosing to be obedient only when it’s convenient or when it suits your own personal style?</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">People often ask me what I learned in this singular experience of writing about a prophet of God. Put simply, I learned to trust the Lord. Our trust in our Father in Heaven, in Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost is an expression of our faith and our willingness—no questions asked--to follow God’s plan for us – individually.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson is such an example of trust. &nbsp;He has said, “As we journey through mortality, let us remember from whence we came; let us be true to the trust vested in us. Let us remember who we are and what God expects us to become.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson trusts that we all can have “joy in the journey.” But that joy comes from being obedient to the Lord’s commandments, having a humble heart, treating others with kindness and respect and being steadfast amidst our many challenges, for they will come.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">On October 6, 1963, Thomas Spencer Monson, age 36, stood at the pulpit in the Salt Lake Tabernacle at General Conference.&nbsp; Newly called to life-long service as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, the youngest in 53 years and almost 20 years younger than the next apostle, he took the chair at the end of the row where he would sit next to Gordon B. Hinckley. Bearing his testimony to the Church membership, only 2.1 million at the time, he said, “I know that God lives, my brothers and sisters. There is no question in my mind. I know that this is his work.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn2"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[ii]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">He has been about that “work” of the Lord now for 53 years.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">At General Conference a few years ago President Monson closed the final session with this statement:&nbsp; “Our Heavenly Father is mindful of us. Of that I testify. I acknowledge His hand in all things.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then he quoted a verse from Proverbs:</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">“In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn3"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[iii]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;">He concluded by saying this: “That has been the story of my life.”</span><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;"><a href="#_edn4"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[iv]</span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">My question is, has it been yours?&nbsp; Do you trust the Lord, his promptings and his commandments as the only way of life for you and those you love? Think about it.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">When a young man President Monson came home on leave from the Navy to see his beloved Frances only to find she was out on a date with another suitor. He finally won her heart and the two got married. &nbsp;World War II ended but there were rumblings that war in Korea was eminent and he was in the Naval Reserve. He did not want to go to war as an enlisted man; so, he applied for Officer Candidate School and was accepted.&nbsp; At about the same time he was called to serve in the Bishopric of his ward, the ward in which he grew up.&nbsp; In a quandary about what to do since the Reserve meetings were on the same night as Bishopric meetings and he would be missing many Sunday services as well, he went to his former stake president Harold B. Lee, then an apostle and eventually president of the Church, and asked for his advice.&nbsp; Tom trusted that Elder Lee would help him sort out the problem.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">As he put his letter of acceptance before Elder Lee and explained his situation, this wise apostle sat back in his chair and took a long look at the earnest young man before him.&nbsp; “Tom,” he said, “I want you to write back to the Navy and decline the invitation to attend Officer’s Candidate School. Then I want you to write to the headquarters of your Naval Reserve unit in San Francisco and ask to be released from the rest of your service obligation.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Tom was stunned.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Lee then looked at him with clear, penetrating eyes and said, “The military is not for you. The Lord has other plans.” (And what were those plans? To serve in the highest councils of the church and some day become the prophet. Tom didn’t know that just like we do not know what is ahead.)</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson remembers thinking, “If he turned down the Officer’s Candidate School he would serve as an enlisted man if the country went to war. And, if he asked to be released from the Naval Reserve they would refuse; they didn’t do that especially with a war on the horizon. That might even call him up to service for even asking.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">But Tom trusted the Lord was speaking to him through Elder Lee and he went home and wrote the two letters. He did not attend Officer Candidate Training and to his great surprise, he miraculously was released from the Naval Reserve. Just a few weeks later, the nation went to war.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson speaks from experience when he says, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn5"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[v]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Lord entrusted each one of us to a family.&nbsp; It is curious that Tommy Monson went to a home where his parents were less active.&nbsp; But they were the best of people in the way they served and cared for others.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">As a child, he grew up in a section of Salt Lake by the railroad tracks.&nbsp; Dirt alleys were his ball fields and his friends came from families desperately poor. He learned all about “love one another” in his home.&nbsp; On Sundays he visited a crippled uncle with his father; time and again he watched his mother feed meals to tramps that knocked at the door.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">His grandfather Tom, who lived just up the street and owned a number of properties on the block, was a favorite companion of his.&nbsp; He was named after his grandfather. Grandpa Tom, a man of few words, was a sheepherder and delighted young Tommy with stories of living on the range, riding his horse, and caring for his sheep. Little did Tommy know that he, too, would care for sheep in his adult years. Just not on horseback.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">One day Tommy and grandpa were sitting on the front porch swing.&nbsp; Down the road came one of their neighbors, an elderly Englishman named Bob.&nbsp; He walked with shoulders slumped and a sorrowful cast on his face.&nbsp; Tom Condie called out, “Bob, how are you today.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Bob just shook his head.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Tom continued, “Come up and sit with us a spell.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Bob joined Tom and Tommy on the swing and after a few minutes, Grandpa Tom said, “So Bob, how are you doing.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Bob just shrugged at first and then said, “I’ve been thrown out of my place; they’re tearing it down and I don’t have anywhere to go. I don’t have much. I don’t have any family and I don’t know what I am going to do.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">The three kept swinging. Grandpa Tom. Tommy and Bob.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Finally Grandpa Tom reached his hand into his pocket and pulled out a little leather change purse with a snap.&nbsp; He opened it and reached in and pulled out a key.&nbsp; “See this key,” he said to Bob?&nbsp; It’s to that house next door.&nbsp; I own it.&nbsp; I want you to take the key and move your things in there.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Bob protested.&nbsp; “I can’t afford it.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Tom said, a bit sharply, “I didn’t ask you to pay for it.&nbsp; It’s yours as long as you want to live there.&nbsp; All I ask is that you just be my good neighbor.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson will tell you, “That lesson was not lost on me.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">It is no wonder that President Monson has taught: “The Master could be found mingling with the poor, the downtrodden, the oppressed and the afflicted. Yet, the Master brought hope to the hopeless, strength to the weak, and freedom to the captive.&nbsp; He taught of a better life to come—even eternal life.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#endnote6"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[vi]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I remember asking President Packer one day how he would introduce President Monson to a group of people who did not know him.&nbsp; President Packer leaned back in his chair, smiled and said, “That’s easy.&nbsp; I would tell them President Monson is more Christ-like than the rest of us. More Christ-like than anyone I know.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">But you know, that way can be lonely.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I asked President Monson what it was like to the president since he had been a counselor for more than 20 years and had dedicated temples, called mission presidents, general authorities, all the things done in the Quorum of the First Presidency.&nbsp; What he said surprised me.&nbsp; “It’s lonely.” &nbsp;I wanted to say – call BYU Hawaii – tell them to send flowers! And then he said: But, you know Heidi, I am never alone; “the Lord is always on my right hand and on my left.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Peter described the ministry of the Savior saying, “Jesus Christ went about doing good . . . for God was with him.”<a name="_ednref7" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[vii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a> President Monson has trusted that example all of his life.&nbsp; The question is, do we?</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">In the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus Christ spoke openly of the incredible weight he carried – your sins and mine and everyone else’s. He asked His Father, “If it be possible let this cup pass from me.”&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, that moment was hard.&nbsp; Harder than we can ever imagine. But he then he put his trust in his Father in Heaven’s plan with these telling words, “Nevertheless not my will but thine be done.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn8"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[viii]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">We had trusted him in the pre-earth life to fulfill his part of the plan and he did. Now he trusts us to do our part. Never lose sight of that responsibility. Trust goes two ways.&nbsp; We trust the Lord to be there for us.&nbsp; The Lord trusts us to be there for him.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">“Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings,” Alma instructed his son Helaman, “and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Sister%20Swinton/Sister%20Swinton%20Talk%20Final.docx#_edn9"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[ix]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson trusts in the spirit of revelation and inspiration. He counts it a privilege to be “on the Lord’s errand.” For decades he has reached out to rescue the lonely, bereft, unnoticed and the unrecognized. He gave the clothes off his back and the shoes off his feet to the people behind the Iron Curtain when he visited them frequently for more than 20 years. They had nothing.<a name="2"></a></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">He has spent countless hours with widows and those in care centers and hospitals who were his former primary teachers and Sunday School teachers. They had taught him the gospel trusting in their call to teach not knowing they were teaching a future prophet of God. Familiar to so many of his visits to the elderly, though sometimes late in the evening, was their welcome, “I knew you’d come.” They trusted him.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">He has given comfort and encouragement to those discouraged, those lacking faith in the Lord and he has put his big arms around struggling missionaries far from home.&nbsp; He has shared his cheerful nature with everyone in his path and to the delight of so many youth – he has wiggled his ears.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">“I know that the sweetest experience in all this life,” he says, “is to feel the Lord’s promptings as He directs us in the furtherance of His work.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn10"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[x]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">That kind of “faith forged in the furnace of trials and tears is marked by trust,” President Monson has said. “Only God can count the sacrifice; only God can measure the sorrow; only God can know the hearts of those who serve Him. Pause and remember that divinely given promise: ‘Wherefore, … ye are on the Lord’s errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord’s business.’”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn11"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xi]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">When President Monson was a young Bishop –only 22—he had 84 widows that he cared for and nurtured until he finally spoke at each one of their funerals.&nbsp; One of them was a former Primary president named Melissa.&nbsp; He went to see her when she was in a nursing facility.&nbsp; She was in the lunchroom, sitting all alone, staring at her plate of food with a blank look and touching nothing on the plate.&nbsp; He sat down and started to chat as he does so well.&nbsp; As he talked he took the fork and began to feed her speaking of their experiences in Primary where she showed such love for the boys and girls. From one of the other tables came a loud comment from one of the other residents.&nbsp; “Don’t talk to her,” the woman said. “She doesn’t know anyone—even her own family.&nbsp; I don’t think she has said a word in all the time she’s been here.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson was undaunted and continued his commentary.&nbsp; As he stood to leave, he took her hand, frail and aged in his, and said, “God bless you, Melissa.&nbsp; Merry Christmas.”&nbsp; And then, she looked up at him.&nbsp; “I know you,” she said. “You’re Tommy Monson, my Primary boy. How I love you.” She kissed his hand as tears ran down her cheeks.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">When he was a mission president, age 32, in Toronto, Canada, he woke one morning and felt a strong impression to visit a small branch up north. It was a change of plans and a quite a drive so he had to hurry.&nbsp; He arrived just after the meeting started and went in and sat down on the backbench.&nbsp; The branch president said to the congregation, we have a surprise, President Monson is with us today. We are going to ask him to come sit on the stand.&nbsp; So he began the walk to the front.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">Unknown to him was the plight of one of his missionaries assigned to the branch.&nbsp; He had been out only a few months and was so discouraged he had decided to go home. In his mind, he and his companion had no investigators, no one was listening to them, the members were not helping; no one cared about him or even knew he was there. He had determined it was pointless to stay.&nbsp; He had packed his bag, slipped it under his bed intending to leave just after church and catch the train west.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">So Mission President Monson is walking up to the front and feels impressed to stop—just for a second—and pat that new elder on the back. Then he leaned over and whispered in his ear, “The Lord loves you.&nbsp; He loves you for how hard you are trying and so do I.”&nbsp; And then he went up and sat on the stand.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">That young elder didn’t go home.&nbsp; He stayed and became a great missionary.&nbsp; “I knew that he loved me,” the missionary has said.&nbsp; “That’s what I needed.”&nbsp; &nbsp;And he points to that moment when President Monson, prompted by the spirit—as he always is—had heard the voice of the spirit say, “Stop, say something.” And he did.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson has taught, “We are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness—be they family members, friends, acquaintances or strangers.&nbsp; We are the Lord’s hands here upon the earth.”<a href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span>&nbsp;</a></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">How is it for all of you?&nbsp; Do you stride from class to class oblivious to those around you. Do you plan your day leaving no room for the Lord or his work? Do you partake of the Sacrament with the promise “to always have his spirit with you” and then set aside that sacred covenant during the week? Do you sometimes think of those words from the Primary song, “Heavenly Father, are you really there?”<a name="_ednref13" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xiii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a> and then ignore the small and tender offerings of kindness from someone at your side?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">President Monson has taught, “The actions whereby we demonstrate that we truly do love God and our neighbor as ourselves will rarely be such as to attract the gaze and admiration of the world. Usually our love will be shown in our day-to-day associations with one another.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn15"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xv]</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I remember going into his office when I had experienced a series of very bad days following a big disappointment. I was seriously discouraged.&nbsp; I couldn’t shake the sadness I felt. I had done all the things I could think of. I had prayed and fasted and been to the temple.&nbsp; I had looked for answers in the scriptures. And still I couldn’t bounce back. &nbsp;Finally, I thought perhaps the President could help me.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I had watched so many people file into his office with heads down and leave with light in their eyes, renewed hope and a brighter countenance.&nbsp; So I sat down in his office and began to tell him my story.&nbsp; I was maybe two sentences into the account, hadn’t gotten to the really bad part, when he suddenly leapt to his feet, put his hand in the air like he does in Conference when he is reinforcing a point, when he wants us to pay attention, and he said, “Heidi, trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not on thine own understanding. I knew the scripture. I knew it was close to his heart and that he knew it was true.&nbsp; Trust the Lord, he was saying.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">And so he is saying to all of you.&nbsp; You are disappointed that you aren’t married yet; you didn’t get the job; you have too many commitments and not enough time; you bombed a test. You are carrying a weight of guilt or a hardened heart for something someone did to you. Life isn’t working out the way you planned.&nbsp; It isn’t working for you.&nbsp; President Monson would tell you, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">You are not alone in the journey. When the Lord says, “I will go before your face,” he says, I am out in front, taking the wind and the rain for you, I am picking up every bad day and every disappointment that seem too many to count.&nbsp; I have been there for you, he is saying, and I have already paid that price of that pain.&nbsp; Feel the peace that I have given you.&nbsp; “My peace I give unto you, not as the giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither left it be afraid.”<a name="_ednref16" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xvi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a>&nbsp; In other words – trust in the Savior, your Savior.&nbsp; It may take time; you have it. It may take a change of course at his prompting; do it.&nbsp; Just know that if you trust him, you are recognizing he can make more of your life than you can.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Lord prepared Thomas S. Monson to be a prophet of God. I bear witness that he is a prophet of God.&nbsp; He was a printer by trade, a cowboy at heart but a disciple of Jesus Christ to the core of his being.&nbsp; He has said to all of us, “Your future is as bright as your faith.”<a name="_ednref17" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xvii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a> His testimony of Jesus Christ reaches deep into my heart.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &amp;amp; color: #262626;"><span style="font-size: small;">I was so taken by the beautiful music that began this session.&nbsp; “I Know That My Redeemer Lives” is my favorite song.&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn’t know that.&nbsp; But I can hardly get through it.&nbsp; Especially when we get to that part that says “He lives, he lives who once was dead.”<a name="_ednref19" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: #262626;">[xix]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a>&nbsp; I know that is true and I trust that truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>February 16, 2016<br />Jeffrey C. Swinton<br />Laie Hawaii Temple Visitors’ Center Director<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha.</p>
<p>I suspect that many of you have walked into the Laie Hawaii Temple Visitors’ Center. My first experience there was exactly one month ago today—the first morning after our arrival to serve as the Director of the Temple Visitors’ Center. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most such centers around the world, visitors immediately come face-to-face with an oversized representation of the risen Lord, Jesus the Christ. In our Temple Visitors’ Center the 5 ton, 10 foot marble statue, standing 14 feet in the air is called simply, the Christus. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been given voice, in 31 languages—sharing some of His most precious and comforting teachings, like:</p>
<p>“Behold, I am Jesus Christ. . . . &nbsp;I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. ” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">3 Nephi 9:15</a>]</p>
<p>“ . . . I came into the world to do the will of my Father . . . My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the Cross . . . that I might draw all men unto me . . . “ &nbsp;[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-14?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:13-14</a>] &nbsp;and,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet . . . behold I . . . have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent . . .“ [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.37?lang=eng#36" target="_blank">D&amp;C 6:37</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">19:16</a>]</p>
<p>What have you thought about when you have stood in front of the Christus? Why do you think it is there?</p>
<p>My hope today is that you will never look upon the Christus in the same way again; that your appreciation for the Savior’s Atonement will be expanded; and, that your understanding of your responsibilities will be made more clear.</p>
<p>This morning I want to take you back in time to some experiences we shared in our pre-mortal life. I don’t know how far back. Some day we will see our past more clearly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We were living at that time as spirits with distinct and unique identities. We wanted to become like our Heavenly Father and learned that the only way to do so was to experience mortality and return home to His presence with a resurrected body. &nbsp;We also learned that there were certain conditions that must be satisfied before we would be qualified to return to His presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President John Taylor has taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There are certain eternal laws by which the Gods in the eternal worlds are governed and which they cannot violate, and do not want to violate. These certain principles must be kept, and one principle is, that no unclean thing can enter into the Kingdom of God.” [Journal of Discourses 25:165-166]</p>
<p>What that meant to us back then is that we would not ever be able to become like our Father in Heaven unless we could return from our mortal life unblemished from our experiences on earth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a practicality, I imagine that seemed to us to be virtually impossible, because once we sinned we would no longer be eligible to return. Without living a perfect life on earth we could never come home to live in our Father’s presence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe we realized then how improbable it was that we could live a perfect life on the earth. I suspect that was discouraging to us, but we learned that our Father in Heaven had a solution for us. From latter-day revelation we have been taught that we all participated in a Grand Council in Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that setting we heard details of our Father’s plan that included granting us agency with all the associated personal growth that would come to us through our proper exercise of that agency. It also included a means for any disqualifying sins or transgressions to be removed from the record of our lives, thereby enabling us to return to our Father in Heaven without blemish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learned that if one of His children could live an impeccably perfect mortal life and then willingly suffer for the sins, pains and afflictions of every one of the rest of us, that child of our Father in Heaven would have the authority to share the eternal rights he had earned with us and allow us to escape the inevitable punishment of our own sins if we kept His commandments. It was, in the words of Jacob, to be “an infinite Atonement”. One stepped forward and accepted that role. We know Him here on the earth as Jesus the Christ.</p>
<p>It was explained to us that in some miraculous way, blessed by being born to a mortal mother but at the same time having an immortal Father, the firstborn spiritual son of our Father in Heaven would be able to overcome the odds, live that impeccably perfect life and then, if He was still willing, take upon Himself all of our sins, our pains, our sufferings and, yes, even our very bad days, and then, after all of that, freely allow His life to be brutally taken. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been taught that an alternative plan was introduced for our consideration by one of our siblings whom we now call Lucifer. He appealed to us by pointing out the risks we would be assuming by accepting our Father’s plan. &nbsp;Among those risks were whether Jesus Christ would or even could really do everything He promised to do and also whether we would have the personal strength to exercise our agency in a way that would entitle us to be exalted. &nbsp; Inexplicably Lucifer promised we could all be saved through a plan of compulsion controlled by him—abandoning our agency and the associated growth and experience it would bring us--and for which we would give him all the glory.</p>
<p>Each one of us here today made a decision to trust in the promises of our Father and of Jesus Christ as distinguished from those of Lucifer. That was our first lesson in exercising faith. We made that decision knowing full well that our Father’s plan would only be successful if Jesus Christ did everything He promised He would do. If He failed in any particular, our eternal future would be in jeopardy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When we voted to accept the Father’s plan, we were expressing faith in our Father in Heaven---and we were expressing faith in our spiritual brother, Jesus Christ. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflect with me on one of many prophecies of the coming of Jesus Christ that was received and written here on the earth long before His birth. &nbsp;Remember when King Benjamin was speaking to his people at the temple erected in the land of Zarahemla approximately 124 years before the birth of Jesus Christ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I love King Benjamin. I love the message he shared with his people on that occasion in chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the Book of Mosiah. His message was given to him by an angel. We know that so many people came at his request to hear him that he built a tower on the grounds of the temple on which to stand so his voice would carry over a longer distance. That effort proved inadequate and, to quote from the record:</p>
<p>“. . . therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.“ &nbsp;[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:8</a>]</p>
<p>Now, I don’t have any unique insight into the number or nature of the records that Mormon had in his possession 500 years later as he completed his abridgment of what has become known as The Book of Mormon. Because King Benjamin’s words were written at the time they were spoken, Mormon may well have had a copy of King Benjamin’s talk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes sense to me that Mormon may have merely included the entire talk the way it was originally written, without abridgment—in the first person--in King Benjamin’s own words, in the early chapters of Mosiah. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen to what King Benjamin said and imagine that you lived and were present on that occasion—124 years before the birth of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>“1 And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2 And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;3 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5 For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6 And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7 And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;8 And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.1-8?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:1-8</a>]</p>
<p>That is one of the very clear prophecies of what the Savior would do for us—given by a prophet of God to a people living 124 years before Jesus Christ was even born. Remarkably, the people listening to King Benjamin “cried with one voice, saying: Yea we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us”. &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2?lang=eng#1" target="_parent">Mosiah 5:2</a>) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Put yourselves in their place. Imagine the Savior had not yet come to the earth and we were listening to a prophet today telling us that a Savior would be born 124 years from now—in the year 2140. Would you believe all the words which he spoke to you? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Gratefully we don’t have to worry about how we would respond to that hypothetical because we have the benefit of looking back. &nbsp;Christ has come. &nbsp;Even so, with the perspective that we have, ask yourself, how much do I really believe? What do I really feel about Jesus Christ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout this talk I want you to reflect upon your own personal testimony of Jesus Christ as your Savior and Redeemer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My testimony of Him and His role in my life has evolved over the years. When I was young, my seminary teacher, Richard Chidester, quoted from the 13th verse of the 46th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants as he was preparing to bear his testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>He read from verse 13:</p>
<p>“To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.13?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">D&amp;C 46:13</a>]</p>
<p>He then bore his testimony that he was one of those to whom it was given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
<p>I remember sitting there in a classroom in the innocence and honesty of youth saying to myself “I don’t know that”.</p>
<p>He then made me feel better by reading verse 14 in that same Section:</p>
<p>“To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">D&amp;C 46:14</a>]</p>
<p>That gave me some comfort and for years thereafter I viewed my seminary teacher as, what I called, a “Verse 13 guy”—one who knew for himself through the Holy Ghost. At the same time I viewed myself as a “Verse 14 guy”—one who believed on his words. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years as I have come to recognize how the Holy Ghost communicates with my spirit---and how my spirit communicates with my body, I have learned to recognize certain feelings and impressions as coming to me directly from the Holy Ghost. With that uniquely personal insight, the time did come when I became a Verse 13 guy. When it was given to me by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in life when I was called as an Area Seventy I read in the 107th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants that the Seventy are called to be “especial witnesses” of the name of Christ. I was comforted by the reality that I could fulfill that assignment with authenticity. I already knew and could honestly testify of my personal witness.</p>
<p>Where are you on that continuum? How strong is your witness of Jesus Christ? &nbsp;Are you struggling to even become a Verse 14 brother or sister—to even believe in the words of someone else? Or are you already a Verse 14 brother or sister with a belief that is founded upon the words of another? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever you are, contemplate what stands in the way of your becoming a Verse 13 brother or sister? &nbsp;One to whom “it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God”. You can be, you know.</p>
<p>We often refer to verses 3 and 4 of the 10th Chapter of Moroni as the key to obtaining a witness of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon where we are taught that: “having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me encourage you to read a bit further. &nbsp;In verses 5, 6 and 7 we learn:</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;“And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;“And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.</p>
<p>7 “And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost. . . .” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.5-7?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Moroni 10:5-7</a>]</p>
<p>The “he” spoken of in Verse 7 is Jesus Christ. This is not a privilege reserved for apostles and prophets. It is a scriptural promise to each of us; each of us in this room today. Each of us may know that Jesus Christ is, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Now, continue to listen with your heart as we talk more about Jesus Christ today.</p>
<p>I want you to imagine in your mind your pre-mortal life. Contemplate what you might have been feeling in the Heavens at the time the Savior was on the earth and coming to the end of His mortal life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, we all took a huge gamble at the time of the Council in Heaven. We put all our future in the hands of Him who would be known as Jesus Christ. &nbsp;We expressed faith in Him by accepting our Father’s plan. &nbsp;Our future was literally placed in His hands. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier we read a prophecy of his Atonement made 124 years before His birth. &nbsp;Read now in the 22nd Chapter of Luke of the actual experience as it took place in the meridian of time. This was the moment for Him to make good on the promise He made to each of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</p>
<p>40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.39-40?lang=eng#38" target="_blank">Luke 22:39-40</a>]</p>
<p>I don’t know if we were watching as Jesus Christ walked across the Kidron Valley to the Garden of Gethsemene. I don’t know if we saw Him kneel or heard his prayers—but I like to think that perhaps, because of the importance of this singular moment to our eternal futures, we were allowed to observe Him from the Heavens. If so, imagine that singular moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps we sensed how hard it would be for Him to complete the atonement and were doing our best at a distance to cheer Him on--hoping He would not quit. Perhaps we voiced renewed faith in His promise.</p>
<p>Again in Luke we read:</p>
<p>“41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</p>
<p>42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.41-42?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">[Luke 22:41-42</a>]</p>
<p>I wonder if we worried that the plan would be interrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then we heard Him say: &nbsp;“nevertheless not my will but thine, be done.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42?lang=eng#41" target="_blank">Luke 22:42</a>]</p>
<p>At that moment I can imagine that we must all have cheered at His expressed resolve to complete His promised mission, while ominously sensing that we certainly could not personally feel what He must have been experiencing or would experience in the coming hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And then something very tender occurred. We only find it in the account of Luke:</p>
<p>“43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.43?lang=eng#42" target="_blank">Luke 22:43</a>]</p>
<p>I love this representation of that moment. &nbsp;The Danish artist, Frans Schwarz, envisioned and painted this masterpiece in 1898. &nbsp;Look at the anguish in the face of our Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at the angel. I even like the wings. I believe our Father sent someone to His Son whom Christ knew well and whose mere presence would have given Him strength and comfort. &nbsp;That visit was tender, important, and yet short lived, as the angel must have departed to allow the full impact of the Atonement.</p>
<p>Now think about what came next:</p>
<p>“44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.44?lang=eng#43" target="_blank">Luke 22:44</a>]</p>
<p>He completed that portion of His ministry—for us. That first and perhaps most difficult step in the events leading up to His death. &nbsp; &nbsp;I imagine I would have both wept for Him as I watched Him suffer, and shouted for joy that the plan was working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so it occurred. &nbsp;I know it occurred. &nbsp;We can’t ever comprehend how difficult it was for Him, but we have heard Him reflect upon it as recently as 1830. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In March of 1830, 1,800 years after He had fulfilled His role in the Atonement, Jesus Christ graphically recalled the pain He suffered in the Garden and on the Cross in a revelation directed to Martin Harris and given through Joseph Smith. &nbsp;We find it in the 19th Section of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants. &nbsp;Perhaps what the Savior said to Martin Harris could also be said to each of us at one time or another in our lives:</p>
<p>“13 Wherefore, I command you to repent, and keep the commandments which you have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name;</p>
<p>14 And it is by my almighty power that you have received them;&nbsp;</p>
<p>15 Therefore I command you to repent—repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</p>
<p>16 For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</p>
<p>17 But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.13-17?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">D&amp;C 19:13-17</a>]</p>
<p>Now listen to how pointedly He described his suffering 1,800 years after the event; how fresh the experience was in His mind. &nbsp;He said to Joseph Smith:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“18 Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink—</p>
<p>&nbsp;19 Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.” [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.18-19?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">D&amp;C 19:18-19</a>]</p>
<p>Because He did finish His preparations, every one of our Father in Heaven’s children born on the earth will be resurrected. There is nothing more you or they need to do for that to occur. Jesus Christ opened that door. We may have seen it occur from the Heavens.</p>
<p>We knew from what we were taught in the pre-earth life that for us to return to the presence of our Father and live with Him and His Son forever, we needed to be worthy, to continually repent, and to receive every saving ordinance and enter into significant covenants with our Father in Heaven. That is required for you and for me—for every one of our Father’s children. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of us born at this time the additional responsibility has been given to identify individuals who have lived without having the blessings of baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the Priesthood, and the temple and then to receive every saving ordinance and enter into every required covenant vicariously for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without us ultimately engaging in family history and temple work, the purpose of the Savior’s atonement for all of our Father in Heaven’s children cannot be fully fulfilled. He is relying on us now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We live here in Laie on sacred ground. You know it. You can feel it. There is a reason you have come here, and it is not only to obtain an outstanding education. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You are blessed to live and study so near to a Temple; and, are doubly blessed to have a Temple Visitors’ Center nearby. Only a handful of Temples in the world are blessed to have a Temple Visitors’ Center on their grounds. A Temple Visitors’ Center is designed to focus our attention on the blessings of the Temple. It is a unique place to learn about the Temple and those promised blessings; to connect with the Spirit; to contemplate the purpose of your life; and, to share that spirit and knowledge with others.</p>
<p>I can’t walk into the Temple Visitors’ Center and face that magnificent marble Christus without sensing the pain of His suffering for us; feeling His love; and being overwhelmed with gratitude. It both humbles and motivates me.</p>
<p>I can’t listen to the narration of some of our Savior’s teachings from the text of Holy Scripture while sitting at His feet without wanting to personally hear His voice, to see His face, to be better, and to be entitled to live forever in His presence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How about you? Come to the Temple Visitors’ Center frequently. No recommend is required. I promise you that if you come seeking, you will be blessed.</p>
<p>Now, in my later years I look back with deep gratitude at the choices I made while your age to strengthen my testimony of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now a “Verse 13 brother.” And you can be so as well. Everyone of us may know by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ lives, that He is the only Begotten Son of the Living God. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not there yet, then trust in Verse 14 and believe on the words of those who do know, while continuing to seek to know for yourselves. Nothing for you will ever be the same once you really know Him and understand His role in your life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I witness that I know that Jesus Christ lives and is our Savior and Redeemer; and, I share that witness with you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>February 9, 2016 <br />Marynelle Chew<br />Head of Access and Collections Services<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I received the initial invitation to speak last October, I was shocked. I am a behind-the-scenes type of girl and my first thought was, “Oh, this must have been sent to the wrong person.” Shock soon gave way to panic and, like Jonah running away from Ninevah, I set the letter aside and pretended I hadn’t received it. Child psychologists call this “magical thinking,” or the belief that thinking something is so makes it so. This is childish behavior, not childlike behavior, which is an important distinction as we will see. A few weeks later I received a follow up call from Sister Faonelua and I did firmly commit to the calling of speaking with you today. I hope that you and I will find the experience to not be as daunting as three days in the belly of the whale!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I was pondering over what to talk about, a phrase from President Uchdorf’s November 2015 conference address, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/it-works-wonderfully?lang=eng" target="_blank">It Works Wonderfully</a>", came to mind. “This beautiful Gospel is so simple a child can grasp it, yet so profound and complex that it will take a lifetime—even an eternity—of study and discovery to fully understand it.” Yes! It is so simple that a child can grasp it! And it is so simple that I have something to share with you!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In speaking to the Nephites, the Lord twice exhorted them to become like a little child:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">37 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">38 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.37-38?lang=eng#36" target="_blank">3 Nephi 11:37-38</a> (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clearly, it’s important to become as a little child. While the Apostle Paul tells us to put away childish things (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>), the Savior teaches us to become as a little child. What, then, differentiates childlike from childish? The Guide to the Scriptures defines the “Children of Christ” as those who have accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Scripture references in this section say that these are the humble, the believing and those who put off the natural man. In preaching to people of Gideon, Alma listed qualities that I associate with being childlike: “… be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Alma 7:23</a>) &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Childish behavior, on the other hand, sounds to me like what Paul described in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:2 </a>– selfish, covetous, disobedient, unthankful. The opposite of childlike.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What then must we be doing to acquire the characteristics and traits listed by Alma and the scriptures to become as a little child? I say let’s go to Primary! Better yet, let’s go to Sharing Time and learn the songs of Primary!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many years ago, B.I.—Before Internet—I read about a hierarchy of remembering information. This book (which I haven’t been able to re-find) claimed that recalling information set to music was associated with the highest levels of retention. Information set as a story was second and other types of retention and recall—seeing, hearing, reading—fell far below. Have you ever woken up with a song stuck in your head? My grandson loves the “Hickory Dickory Dock” song from the Mother Goose Club and plays it constantly. I can’t tell you how many times that song pops into my head at random times. While I don’t have evidence to support the contention that remembering things set to music is most effective, I do believe that music is a strong factor in helping us remember things. &nbsp;And I do believe that the songs of Primary, which are “so simple a child can grasp” can help all of us grasp and remember the beautiful principles of the Gospel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like many of you, I joined the Church after childhood and did not get to attend Primary. But as an adult and a parent, I have now learned many of the songs. &nbsp;Those of you who have heard me sing may rest easy: I shall not be singing anything to you today. I will only recite lyrics; however, for those of you who may not have attended Primary or who need a refresher, both the music and lyrics for most of these songs may be found in the Children’s Songbook at <a href="https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng" target="_blank">LDS.ORG</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What are the most primary teachings of the Church? I think they are found in the Articles of Faith.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let us then begin to review the basic truths of “this beautifully simple Gospel” with the first Article of Faith:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Articles of Faith 1:1</a>) &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the January 2016 Ensign, Apostle Jeffrey R. Holland reminds us of Joseph Smith’s teachings: ““It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the character of God.” Furthermore, he added, “I want you all to know Him, and to be familiar with Him.” We must have “a correct idea of his … perfections, and attributes” and an admiration for “the excellency of [His] character.”” (Jeffery R. Holland, January 2016 Ensign, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2016/01/knowing-the-godhead?lang=eng" target="_blank">Knowing the Godhead.</a>)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What do Primary songs teach us about the character of Heavenly Father? Primary teaches us that He lives and that He loves us! Listen to the lyrics from “I Know My Father Lives” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/i-know-my-father-lives?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 5</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. I know my Father lives and loves me too. The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me it is true…</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. He sent me here to earth, by faith to live his plan. The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me that I can…</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Did you hear that? The Spirit tells us that we have the ability to succeed. Sometimes we look at others who seem to be doing better than we are. We look at ourselves and think that we’re just not celestial material, that we’re just too imperfect to possibly reach exaltation. When you think that, to borrow another phrase from President Uchdorf, “Stop it!” Stop listening to that negative, discouraging self-talk and listen to the Sprit tell you that Heavenly Father sent us here to live His plan. And we can! (President Dieter F. Uchdorf, April 2012 Conference,<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/04/the-merciful-obtain-mercy?lang=eng" target="_blank"> The Merciful Obtain Mercy</a>.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The song “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/my-heavenly-father-loves-me?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 228</a>) reminds us that all things testify of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Whenever I hear the song of a bird Or look at the blue, blue sky, Whenever I feel the rain on my face Or the wind as it rushes by, Whenever I touch a velvet rose Or walk by our lilac tree, I'm glad that I live in this beautiful world Heav'nly Father created for me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. He gave me my eyes that I might see The color of butterfly wings. He gave me my ears that I might hear The magical sound of things. He gave me my life, my mind, my heart: I thank him rev'rently For all his creations, of which I'm a part. Yes, I know Heav'nly Father loves me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you not rejoice when you see the beauty of the earth around you? The patchwork variety of greens in the mountains and crazy quilt of blues in the sea? Have you ever stroked the hilahila or sleeping grass plant and marveled at the way it curls up? Have you listened to the music of the waves at night? My heart gladdens whenever I see the radiance of a rainbow and I am also reminded of His covenant and that He will always keep His promises. I invite us all to look, to hear, to feel and to use all our senses to rediscover a childlike delight for and to rejoice in the beautiful world that Heavenly Father has created for us. I invite us all to pause from time to time, be still and breathe, and remember as we breathe who gave us our lives. I invite us to remember as we learn new things in our studies who gave us our mind. I invite us to look for connections to see that all things testify of God. And I invite us all to rejoice and give thanks as we do all these things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Along with knowing who Heavenly Father is, Primary teaches us who we are in the beloved song, “I Am a Child of God.” Isn’t that a marvelous and gladsome thing to know? That we are children of the Almighty Creator of the heavens and the earth and that He loves us and cares about us individually! Yes, there are bumps and bruises, disappointments and sorrows in this earthly experience. But even though it rarely seems like it at the time we’re going through it, these mortal trials are truly just a small moment to us. Take a child’s perspective. Children don’t dwell on the scraped knees of yesterday. They fall down and then they jump back up. They may cry, ask for a Band-Aid and a hug. And maybe a cookie. But they don’t stop and wallow in the bad. They move on. They find the joy in the moment. Let us, too, rejoice in the moment and rejoice in being children of God!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What does Primary teach us about Jesus Christ? In the song “This is My Beloved Son” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/this-is-my-beloved-son?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 76</a>), we learn that Jesus Christ is God’s Son and we learn that the Savior accomplishes the Lord’s plan:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Jesus entered Jordan's waters When His work had just begun. God the Father spoke from heaven: &nbsp;"This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Nephites gazing into heaven Saw their white-robed Savior come. And they heard the Father witness: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. Joseph saw two glorious beings Shining brighter than the sun. God again presented Jesus: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. As I read the scriptures daily--Words of Christ, the Holy One--In my heart I'll hear God tell me: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The last verse is especially important. Gaining a personal testimony of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, isn’t just for prophets, apostles and other Church leaders. It’s for you. It’s for me. As we study, pray and strive to obey, we can also receive a witness from the Father that Jesus Christ is His Beloved Son.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Primary teaches us of Heavenly Father’s Plan and the essential role of the Savior in His plan. &nbsp;One of my favorite songs, “He Sent His Son” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/he-sent-his-son?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 34</a>), beautifully expresses The Plan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How could the Father tell the world of love and tenderness? He sent his Son, a newborn babe, with peace and holiness. How could the Father show the world the pathway we should go? He sent his Son to walk with men on earth, that we may know. How could the Father tell the world of sacrifice, of death? He sent his Son to die for us and rise with living breath. What does the Father ask of us? What do the scriptures say? Have faith, have hope, live like his Son, help others on their way. What does he ask? Live like his Son.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What does Primary teach us about the Holy Ghost? Primary teaches us about the role of the Holy Ghost and how He communicates with us in the song “The Holy Ghost” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/the-holy-ghost?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 105</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. When Christ was on the earth, He promised he would send The Holy Ghost to comfort us, Our true, eternal friend. The Holy Spirit whispers With a still small voice. He testifies of God and Christ And makes our hearts rejoice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. And when we are confirmed By sacred priesthood pow'r, The Holy Ghost is giv'n to us To guide us ev'ry hour. Oh, may I always listen To that still small voice. And with his light I'll do what's right Each time I make a choice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">C. S. Lewis, a British novelist perhaps best known for The Chronicles of Narnia, wrote an autobiography entitled Surprised by Joy in which he tells of his conversion to Christianity from atheism. The title phrase, “surprised by joy’” always makes me think of the Holy Ghost. How often have you felt the spirit give you a hug or whisper encouragement or felt a flood of joy for seemingly no reason at all? May we all unplug from our electronics and retreat from the din of daily life from time to time so that we can feel and hear the still small voice in our lives and be surprised by the joy he brings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The First Article of Faith has given us a correct knowledge of the Godhead, foundation of our faith. The Fourth Article of Faith teaches us more about what we need to do: &nbsp;“We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Articles of Faith 1:4</a>)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What does it mean to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ? It’s more than a belief, although belief is the beginning. We don’t merely believe in the historical Jesus who walked the earth 2,000 years ago. Faith is an action word, not a passive word. We must actively follow the living Savior’s admonition in<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank"> 3 Nephi 27:27</a> “…Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of my favorite songs, “I’m Trying to Be like Jesus” <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/im-trying-to-be-like-jesus?lang=eng" target="_blank">(Children’s Songbook, p. 78</a>), teaches us how we can be even as He is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. I’m trying to be like Jesus; I'm following in his ways. I'm trying to love as he did, in all that I do and say. At times I am tempted to make a wrong choice, But I try to listen as the still small voice whispers, "Love one another as Jesus loves you. Try to show kindness in all that you do. Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought, For these are the things Jesus taught."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. I'm trying to love my neighbor; I'm learning to serve my friends. I watch for the day of gladness when Jesus will come again. I try to remember the lessons he taught. Then the Holy Spirit enters into my thoughts, saying: “Love one another as Jesus loves you. Try to show kindness in all that you do. Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought, For these are the things Jesus taught."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we try to be like Jesus, our faith grows and the more our faith grows, the more we are able to be like Jesus. So wonderfully simple!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second principal of the Gospel is repentance. The Gospel Topic, “Repentance” found on Lds.org clarifies that, “Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our Father in Heaven has provided the only way for us to be forgiven of our sins. Jesus Christ suffered the penalty for our sins so we can be forgiven if we sincerely repent. As we repent and rely on His saving grace, we will be cleansed from sin.” Please do not mistake my next words that I am making light of our need to repent, or saying that it is an effortless thing of no consequence. Repentance is “essential to our temporal and eternal happiness.” (Gospel Topics, Repentance, LDS.ORG) &nbsp;But, it’s not a difficult principle to grasp. While not necessarily easy, the steps are simple. They’re right in your hand: 1) Recognize that you are doing something wrong or not doing something right; 2) Regret your actions or inactions. This regret is a godly sorrow that you have offended God and others, not a worldly sorrow or embarrassment at having have been caught; 3) Report to Lord in your prayers, and to an ecclesiastical authority if necessary; 4) Restore to the best of your ability—if you’ve injured someone or something, do all that you can to make it right; 5) Resolve to sin no more. &nbsp;And if you slip up, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat these steps with all sincerity of heart. Like a child learning to walk, you might not get it right the first time. Please remember, you don’t have to do it all alone. You don’t have to be perfect before you ask for help. Like an earthly parent teaching a toddler to walk, your Heavenly Father is there, waiting to help you, just a prayer away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The song “Help Me Dear Father” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/help-me-dear-father?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 99</a>) reassures us that help is near to hand.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Help me, dear Father, to freely forgive All who may seem unkind to me. &nbsp;Help me each day, Father, I pray; Help me live nearer, nearer to thee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Help me, dear Father, to truly repent, Making things right, and changing my ways. Help me each day, Father, I pray; Help me live nearer, nearer to thee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Spencer W. Kimball’s slogan was “Do it.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/do-it-now?lang=eng" target="_blank">Donald L. Hallstrom, October 2007 Conference, Do It Now</a>)This slogan is particularly applicable to repentance. &nbsp;Do it. Do it now. The longer you wait, the harder it is. I want to share a story I call the allegory of the stove. I am a terrible cook. I grew eating over-cooked, fairly bland meals. We seasoned food only with salt, pepper and onions. Garlic was considered an exotic spice. My husband, on the other hand, is an excellent cook, well acquainted with garlic and other exotic spices. Early on in our marriage he took over the cooking duties in self-defense while I assumed the kitchen clean-up tasks, which I am good at. This went fairly well until after baby number five joined our family. At that point caring for children, working full-time and trying to keep house became too much for me. Something had to give, and even though we had other little hands to help (and hinder), housework was the thing I let go. Every once in a while, though, I’d have a fit of energy and try to do a deep clean. While scrubbing away at some stubborn, burnt-on food on the stove one day, it occurred to me that scrubbing at this stain was a lot like sin and repentance. Had I taken care of the spill immediately, I would not have had to work so hard to remove it. And, as is true with sin, despite my best and sincere efforts, I could not completely remove the stain by myself. I had need of a Savior to redeem that which was beyond my ability to do. So, don’t delay. Don’t let your sin get “baked on.” Clean it up now.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The third principal of the Gospel is baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:8-9</a>, Alma discusses the change of heart and commitments we make at baptism. Some of the words he used include “willing to bear one another’s burdens … mourn with those that mourn … [and] comfort those that stand in need of comfort.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The lyrics of one of my favorite songs, “I’ll Walk With You” were written by Carol Lynn Pearson (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/ill-walk-with-you?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 140</a>), and beautifully illustrate how we can bear one another’s burdens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you don't walk as most people do, Some people walk away from you, But I won't! … &nbsp;If you don't talk as most people do, Some people talk and laugh at you, But I won't! … I'll walk with you. I'll talk with you. That's how I'll show my love for you. Jesus walked away from none. He gave his love to ev'ryone. So I will! I will! Jesus blessed all he could see, Then turned and said, "Come, follow me." And I will! I will! … I'll walk with you. I'll talk with you. That's how I'll show my love for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fourth principal of the Gospel is the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. We already learned a little about the Holy Ghost in the First Article of Faith, and the song “Listen, Listen” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/listen-listen-round?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 107</a>) reminds us what to do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1) Listen to the still small voice! Listen! Listen! (2) when you have to make a choice. He will guide you always.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to assistance from the Holy Ghost, God has given us more tools help us on our journey back to Him: scriptures and prayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Have you ever heard children sing the song “Scripture Power?” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/text/other/scripture-power?lang=eng" target="_blank">Music for Children</a>) They sing the chorus with incredible gusto. Sing this to yourself when you are tempted to skip reading your scriptures, and I guarantee it will put you in the “mood” to study your scriptures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Because I want to be like the Savior, and I can, I’m reading His instructions, I’m following His plan. Because I want the power His word will give to me, I’m changing how I live, I’m changing what I’ll be. Scripture power keeps me safe from sin. Scripture power is the power to win. Scripture power! Ev’ryday I need The power that I get each time I read.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. I’ll find the sword of truth in each scripture that I learn. I’ll take the shield of faith from these pages that I turn. I’ll wear each vital part of the armor of the Lord, And fight my daily battles, and win a great reward. Scripture power keeps me safe from sin. Scripture power is the power to win. Scripture power! Ev’ryday I need The power that I get each time I read.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second tool is prayer. Here is a story about a child’s prayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many years ago Saturdays were very hectic when we had four of our children playing soccer and going to many different fields. Usually my husband and I would divide and conquer, each taking some of the children. One particular morning was more chaotic than the usual flurry of getting kids up and dressed, soccer snacks prepared and everyone out the door on time for their respective games. One child came to me and said she couldn’t find her shoes. Instead of responding like one of those kind mothers you read about in the children’s magazine, The Friend, I snapped at her that she’d best find those shoes or she wouldn’t be playing. This sweet child went to her room and, believing God and His promises that He hears and answers prayers, she knelt in prayer, asking her Heavenly Father where her missing shoes could be found. He blessed her and told her where to look—in a place none of us would have thought of! How simple the faith of a child! The Lord said “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you;” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7</a>) He also said, “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 82:10</a>) When we ask in faith, we receive. It may not be the answer we want and it may not be as quickly as we would prefer, but we will always receive.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have a second story about prayer to share. This time it is of an adult who sometimes forgets to become like a little child. Yes, that adult is me. One day a few months ago I was the last person to leave the house and when I got to the door, I discovered that I did not have my keys. Now I am admittedly old and often forgetful, and I am very particular about keeping my keys in one place. But this morning, no keys. I retraced my steps through the house, while sending up what Cynthia Compton called “little sparrow prayers” in her <a href="http://devotional.byuh.edu/node/347" target="_blank">devotional</a> of November 18, 2008. Sparrow prayers are the quick prayers in your heart: gratitude for rainbows, a prayer for the hurt when an ambulance goes past, and asking for help in finding your keys. As I was frantically looking in the spots I’d already checked, I received the impression to look in the trash. I dismissed that impression and even told the Lord that while I knew I was old and losing it, I was positive I hadn’t thrown them in the trash. I even looked in the refrigerator, but no keys. I continued looking and sending up my sparrow prayers and the impression to look in the trash persisted. I finally heeded the prompting and looked in the trash. No, the keys were not there. What was there was an empty packet of cat treats, which reminded me that I had given the cat a treat a few minutes previously. When I returned to the place where we feed the cat, lo and behold, there were my keys. Now I know the Lord could have told me that in the first place. And I’m sure He had a wry chuckle while He waited for silly daughter to stop scrambling around before finally heeding His prompting. But, mostly I think the experience was to remind me of two lessons: 1) It was a reminder that I can’t do everything by myself; and 2) when we ask the Lord for assistance, we need to be prepared to follow His prompting without questioning it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In conclusion, I believe a good reason to seek Gospel truths in the simple songs of children is that they do get stuck in your head. If you’re going to have something stuck in your head, why not make it something uplifting? The song “Hum Your Favorite Hymn” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/hum-your-favorite-hymn?lang=eng" target="_blank">Children’s Songbook, p. 152</a>) sums it up best:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. If on occasion you have found Your language is in question, Or ugly thoughts come to your mind, Then here's a good suggestion. &nbsp;Just hum your favorite hymn, Sing out with vigor and vim, And you will find it clears your mind. Hum your favorite hymn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Before you say an angry word, Remember you'll regret it, For once it's said the harm is done, And some folks won't forget it. &nbsp;Just hum your favorite hymn, Sing out with vigor and vim, And you will find it clears your mind. Hum your favorite hymn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your mind can only entertain one thought at a time. So, make it a good one!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and Sisters, this Gospel is indeed “…so simple a child can grasp it, yet so profound and complex that it will take a lifetime—even an eternity—of study and discovery to fully understand it.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/it-works-wonderfully?lang=eng" target="_blank">President Dieter F. Uchdorf, November 2015 Conference, It Works Wonderfully</a>.)The simple truth is that God the Father lives and He loves us. Jesus Christ is His Son and He is the only way home to the Father. May we all revisit Primary Sharing Time and fill our minds and hearts with the Gospel truths found in the simple songs the children sing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>February 2, 2106 <br />Edward Kinghorn<br />Psychology Department Chair<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Matthew 5:16</a>)</p>
<p>Throughout our married life Sister Kinghorn and I have tried our best to be active in the Church and fulfill whatever callings or assignments that we have received from our leaders. &nbsp;In addition, we have tried to actively participate in our community. &nbsp;Sister Kinghorn has been a substitute teacher, taught a G.E.D. class at the county Jail, served on the library Board, been a member of a local literacy board, and served as a political party county chairman.</p>
<p>I too have tried my best to remain active in our community. My participation in local and state politics has been particularly rewarding. &nbsp;However, some of my greatest enjoyment has come from my participation in service activities associated with my profession as a licensed Neuropsychologist. &nbsp; I began my academic career as an experimental psychologist conducting animal research and teaching courses in biopsychology. &nbsp;Because of a very influential colleague and mentor, I began retraining as a clinician in the 1990’s. &nbsp;I obtained my license to practice in 2000. &nbsp;My department chairman at the time was a licensed counselor. &nbsp;He had been active as a volunteer counselor with the American Red Cross and suggested that I might find the volunteer service rewarding. &nbsp;He encouraged me to participate in the upcoming disaster mental health training. &nbsp;I finished my Red Cross training in the Fall of 2001 and my very first assignment was to work at a Family Service Center in New Jersey following the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Often we find ourselves in a quandary trying to figure out who might need our service. &nbsp;In an October 2006 General Conference talk Elder Jeffery R. Holland said;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“They are everywhere, on our right hand and on our left, in our neighborhoods and in the workplace, in every community and county and nation of this world. Take your team and wagon; load it with your love, your testimony, and a spiritual sack of flour; then drive in any direction. The Lord will lead you to those in need…..” (Elder Jeffery R. Holland, October 2006,<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/prophets-in-the-land-again?lang=eng" target="_blank"> Prophets in the Land Again</a>)</p>
<p>This was certainly the case in the New York City area after September 11th. &nbsp;Desperate, hurting people were everywhere. &nbsp;A significant number of those who died in the World Trade Center had lived in New Jersey. &nbsp; I spent long difficult days over my Christmas Break in 2001 working with families of the victims and with those who had survived, but were now unemployed and suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress. &nbsp; I returned home in January physically exhausted and emotional spent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure how I mustered the courage and strength to serve a second tour of duty in New York, but with the encouragement from my family, colleagues, and a very supportive university president, I returned again to New York in February 2002 to serve as an out-reach counselor in Lower Manhattan. &nbsp;It was while I was working on this assignment that I met Dr. Frances Menlove. &nbsp;She was a seasoned and experienced clinician. &nbsp;We often worked together on the same outreach team and she helped teach me the skills I needed to be an effective disaster mental health worker. &nbsp;Shortly after I returned home from this assignment I received an e-mail with the text of Sermon she had written about our experiences in New York. &nbsp;She asked me to edit her work for accuracy and sought my permission to use my real name in her sermon. &nbsp;I am humbled and just a little embarrassed about how she portrayed me in the Sermon.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foot Care</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;“Foot Care” was delivered by Frances Lee Menlove as a guest sermon to the Lincoln City Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, on March 10, 2002. &nbsp;By permission I would like to share with you a significant portion of her sermon.</p>
<p>“Jesus got up from the table, took off his robe, and tied a towel around himself. &nbsp;Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around Him….. &nbsp;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them ‘Do you know what I have done to you? &nbsp;You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am. &nbsp;So, if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. &nbsp;For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. &nbsp;Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.1-17?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">John 13: 1-17</a>, New Revised Standard Version of the New Testament).</p>
<p>The story of the Last Supper in the Gospel of John is unlike that in any of the other Gospels. &nbsp;John’s account is the only one that includes this story of Jesus washing the disciples’ feet. &nbsp;We don’t know whether the Christian community John wrote for actually practiced physical foot washing. &nbsp;It is clear, however, that they understood Jesus’ action to symbolize<strong> humble service in love toward one another. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Humble service in love toward one another.</strong></p>
<p>I returned a couple of week ago from New York City, where I was working for the American Red Cross in their ongoing efforts to help victims of September 11th. &nbsp;I was assigned to a Red Cross Center in lower Manhattan about three blocks from Ground Zero as one of six mental health workers. &nbsp;We made house call on people who requested information about counseling resources available. &nbsp;We tried to match peoples’ needs with the resources available and offer help from the Red Cross. &nbsp;The rule was, no one could go alone, so there were always two or three workers at every appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my first day, a colleague told me to be sure to visit St. Paul’s Chapel near Ground Zero. &nbsp;St. Paul’s has been set aside as a sanctuary for workers who were still toiling around the clock to clear the debris of the Twin Towers and to search for human remains.</p>
<p>One day during my second week, I got back early from my morning appointments and decided to head up to St. Paul’s. &nbsp;I had talked with a women that morning whose nine-year-old son had been evacuated from his school, and only since Christmas is he able to sleep without a gas mask in bed next to him. &nbsp;Now he is content if the mask is on the shelf near his bed where he can see it. &nbsp;His mother said the roar of the fighter jets that periodically fly overhead comfort him, although she finds them terrifying.</p>
<p>I was tired that morning. &nbsp;The afternoon before, Ed Kinghorn, another mental health worker who teaches at the Idaho campus of Brigham Young University, asked if I would go with him after work to visit someone he had already visited twice but was still uneasy about. &nbsp;The client had not worked since September 11th and had seldom left his room. &nbsp;The future looked bleak. &nbsp;Late that afternoon we got on the subway for the twenty-five-minute ride to 148th Street in Harlem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This was Ed’s second tour of duty in New York since 9-11. &nbsp;His first was at the Red Cross Center at Liberty Park in New Jersey. &nbsp;He told me about a little boy of about five of six who came into the center with his family soon after 9-11. &nbsp;The boy kept asking why we didn’t stop the terrorists. &nbsp;They tried their best to explain that we were unable to stop them because we did not know they were coming. &nbsp;The boy responded to this by asking, “How many big buildings do we have in New York? &nbsp;Why didn’t we stop them?” &nbsp;They eventually realized with horror that every time the boy had seen a re-run of the attack on TV, he had thought another attack was underway. &nbsp;In his mind, we were being attacked over and over. &nbsp;“Why didn’t we stop them?” he pleaded.</p>
<p>The tenement where Ed’s client, Matt, lived was about two blocks from the subway. &nbsp;Matt, a twenty-seven-year-old African American man, greeted us warmly at the door. &nbsp;He clearly liked Ed and knew Ed cared about him. &nbsp;We sat in a small room on folding lawn chairs. &nbsp;Matt’s bed was a mattress in the corner. &nbsp;Blankets but no sheets. &nbsp;Ed had warned me that there were holes near the floorboard where the wall was rotting and rats could get into the room.</p>
<p>Matt told us he was working in the basement of the second tower when the plane hit. &nbsp;As the tower began to crumble, he heard his grandmother’s voice saying “Run down, Matt, run down.” &nbsp;So he ran. &nbsp;And he ran. &nbsp;He ran through the Path Train Tunnel below the World Trade Center. &nbsp;The next thing he remembered was waking up in a hospital. &nbsp;He was unhurt physically, but since then he had kept to his room. &nbsp;He had not entered the subway once. &nbsp;He hasn’t worked. Friends coax him out once or twice a week but for never more than a few minutes. &nbsp;He had been in the room for about three days, afraid to leave and get milk for his cat, but agreed to visit the corner store if we went with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we walked down the four flights of stairs, he asked where I was from. &nbsp;Oregon, I said. &nbsp;I told him I had a useful piece of information from Oregon that he might not know. &nbsp;“You wonder,” I said, “why seagulls fly over the ocean but not over the bay. &nbsp;The reason is that if they flew over the bay, they wouldn’t be seagulls: &nbsp;they’d be bay gulls.” &nbsp;He laughed and told us about pigeons he had known. &nbsp;We got the milk, walked him back to his room, and he assured Ed he would keep his Thursday appointment with the local trauma counselor. &nbsp;As we left, he smiled and told me to say hello from him to our Oregon seagulls. &nbsp;I looked at him, grinned and promised “I will.”</p>
<p>St. Paul’s was a four-block walk straight up Broadway, past the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange, past the explosive-sniffing dogs, and security guard that still checked every vehicle going down the street. &nbsp;The church was closed to the general public but was open to the workers twenty-four hours a day. &nbsp;The wrought iron fence surrounding the church grounds was covered with thank you notes, crafted flowers, and garlands of origami cranes. &nbsp;The workers from Ground Zero had a short walk to the front gate. &nbsp;My Red Cross badge got me through the gate, but I felt a bit sheepish about intruding, so I quickly slid into a pew and tried to look inconspicuous.</p>
<p>I was totally unprepared for what I saw. &nbsp;The entire chapel was covered with banners, hand-lettered posters, small and large pictures by school children expressing thanks and appreciation. &nbsp;There were notes taped to the sides of very pew, up and down the aisle. &nbsp;Several Banners hung from the balconies.</p>
<p>One four-by twelve-foot pennant had a multitude of hand-drawn green mittens, each signed by a child, with a headline that said “Warm your hearts with our mittens.” &nbsp;Another huge streamer lined up dozens of red children’s hand prints to form the stripes of an American flag. &nbsp;There were notes in the pews. &nbsp;The one tucked in by me said: “Dear Hero, thank you for making us safe. &nbsp;I like soccer. &nbsp;I don’t like baseball. &nbsp;Do you like soccer? &nbsp;Your new friend, Craig.”</p>
<p>The altar was the only place unadorned by posters, notes and banners. &nbsp;Several votive candles were burning. &nbsp;In front of the altar, a flute player from the New York Symphony played lilting melodies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a lot of quiet activity. &nbsp;Along the back wall of the chapel sandwiches and soup were being served. &nbsp;Along the left side of the chapel, tables held first-aid supplies, candies, lip balm, socks, aspirin—anything someone might want coming in from the cold after a shift of spirit-wrenching labor. &nbsp;There was a bowl of power bars, each with a homemade valentine wrapped around it and held tight with a rubber band. &nbsp;All were free for the taking.</p>
<p>In front of me, one man was lying down on the pew, apparently asleep. &nbsp;Others were sitting in the pews eating, or just resting. &nbsp;I didn’t know then that these workers had found four more bodies that morning.</p>
<p>A small enclosed area about eight feet square caught my attention on the right side of the chapel. &nbsp;A large bronze plaque announced that this was George Washington’s pew, the place he worshiped on the day of his inauguration, April 30, 1789. &nbsp;Right next to this official plaque was a large, carefully printed sign “Foot Care.” &nbsp;The workers were having trouble with their feet, so it was decided to devote George Washington’s pew to “Foot Care.” &nbsp;Each day a podiatrist (a lower limb physician) volunteered. &nbsp;One worker had his shoes off and another one was waiting to be examined as I sat scrunched in my own pew.</p>
<p>I remembered the Gospel of John: &nbsp;Jesus got up from the table and tied a towel around himself. &nbsp;Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. &nbsp;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “I have set you an example that you also should do as I have done to you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">v. 15</a>).</p>
<p>Humble service in love toward one another. &nbsp;When Ed from Idaho had asked me that afternoon if I would go on a house call with him to Harlem after work, perhaps he was saying he needed to do some foot care and couldn’t go alone. &nbsp;Perhaps walking with a traumatized man to the corner store to get milk for his cat is foot care.</p>
<p>I thought about what goes on every week in our congregations. &nbsp;Some days you can hear the laughter and buzz of youth side-by-side with adults rehearsing a new production of the family players. &nbsp;Foot Care. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some days the women’s fellowship prepares food for a celebration. &nbsp;Foot Care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some in our congregation play music for Sunday services at the nursing home. &nbsp;Foot Care.</p>
<p>Some of us make sure that a neighbor has a ride to church or the store. &nbsp;Foot Care.</p>
<p>Someone organized a letter-writing campaign to improve health care for the poor. &nbsp;Foot Care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone made sure that a motion-activated light was installed by the side door. &nbsp;Foot Care.</p>
<p><strong>I think that these small acts of service bind us together in a community of love. &nbsp;Maybe foot care is our glue.</strong></p>
<p>Pastoral activity in the face of death was what Jesus did the night of the Last Supper when he washed his disciples’ feet. &nbsp;Pastoral activity in the aftermath of death was the temporary ministry of St. Paul’s Church. &nbsp;The Vicar of St. Paul’s noted in the monthly parish newsletter that the St. Paul Ministry is;</p>
<p>“the only relief effort housed in a church, the only one hosted by clergy, the only one where Bibles and Prayer Books are as much in evidence as hot soup and sandwiches. &nbsp;The ministry of presence is making small but essential steps toward consoling what undoubtedly feels inconsolable in the hearts of many.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder what the architect or planners or builders of St. Paul’s would have thought if they had looked into the future 200-plus years and seen Washington’s pew occupied by a podiatrist. &nbsp;My guess is they would have been both astounded and overjoyed. &nbsp;My guess is that George Washington, who surely knew about death and sore feet, would be honored to have a podiatrist in residence in his pew. &nbsp;What a blessing it would be for us if one hundred years from now we could be astounded and overjoyed with the use of our own church spaces.</p>
<p>We live by stories. &nbsp;We become the stories we tell. &nbsp;I will tell my grandchildren how I went to New York during Lent a few months after September 11th and sat in the chapel where George Washington worshiped on the day he was inaugurated. &nbsp;I will tell them that a professional musician in a long black dress was standing in front of the altar playing “Greensleeves” on the flute. &nbsp;I will tell them there were thank you notes and valentines to the workers tucked in between the hymnals and Bibles. &nbsp;I will tell them Washington’s pew had a sign over it that said “Foot Care” and that a volunteer podiatrist had set up shop there and was examining the bare foot of one of the recovery workers. &nbsp;I will tell them about Ed from Idaho’s compassion and Matt from Harlem’s plucky dignity. &nbsp;I will tell them what foot care can mean beyond podiatry. &nbsp;I will tell them that St. Paul’s Chapel on that afternoon was a sacred place—a sanctuary. &nbsp;A holy place. &nbsp;I will tell them also why, each day, I say hello to the seagulls.”</p>
<p>Thank you for allowing me to share Dr. Menlove’s sermon. &nbsp;I used her words because she was able to express my feelings about service in New York better than I could have done myself.</p>
<p>My experiences working with Red Cross over the years, particularly my first two assignments in New York, have been life changing. &nbsp;The privilege I had of going daily to St Paul’s Episcopal Church during my second assignment has created memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. &nbsp;Words can’t express my feelings of love and gratitude for the clergy and volunteers at St. Paul’s Chapel. &nbsp;They were loving and kind, and their service to me personally enabled me to fulfill my own difficult assignment. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2002 Sister Kinghorn and I were flying to New York to visit our son and his family. &nbsp;Seated next to us on our flight out of Salt Lake City was a man, not a member of our Church, who had been visiting family in the Salt Lake City area. &nbsp;Sister Kinghorn, who has always been braver, more outgoing, and social than I, engaged him in conversation. When he came to the realization that we were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints he immediately made it very clear that he knew “all” he wanted to know about our Church and wasn’t interested in knowing anymore. &nbsp; I then asked him if he was an active member of another church. &nbsp;He proudly stated that he was a lay-minster in the Episcopal Church. &nbsp;I looked at him, smiled, and spent the rest of our flight telling him about my experiences working in New York and the wonderful interactions I had with the clergy and volunteers at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church. &nbsp;I thanked him for their goodness and kind service that they rendered to me. &nbsp;As we exited the plane he turned to us, right in the middle of the jet-way, and said “thank you, as soon as I get home I am going to call my minster and tell him that I met a Mormon who appreciated the good work of the faithful members of our church.” &nbsp;We shook hands and went our separate ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, as the Scriptures have foretold, “We live in perilous times” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">2nd Timothy 3:1</a>). &nbsp;Our natural tendency is to hide ourselves behind real or ideological barriers. &nbsp;But, never more than now has the World needed the “peaceable followers of Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.3-4?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Moroni 7: 3-4</a>) to walk with the children of men. &nbsp;Service opportunities here at BYU Hawaii are all around us. &nbsp;I would encourage all of us to take the time out from our busy schedules and seek out those in need of our help. &nbsp;They are everywhere here, too. &nbsp;In the coming months or years we all will be called upon to leave this wonderful institution to walk, work, and serve among our Father in Heaven’s children. &nbsp;Don’t be afraid or intimidated by the World in which we have been called to live. &nbsp; We were prepared, before the foundations of this World, to be here on the Earth at this time. &nbsp;These are our days. &nbsp;Our Father in Heaven has granted us gifts and talents that will allow us to shine our light before men and glorify our Father in Heaven. &nbsp;I pray that we will ever do so. &nbsp;In the Name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, malo ’e lelei,</p>
<p>Before I begin my devotional talk, I would like to acknowledge my Tongan Heritage with a formal greeting of respect to those who have made this day possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I pay tribute to my Heavenly Father for my being here,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I pay tribute to President David O. McKay for his vision and foresight in choosing this sacred land on which this school stands,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; •<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I pay tribute to President Tanner for this honor that I never thought possible,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; •<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Lastly, I respectfully pay tribute to all of you for your presence here at devotional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being asked to speak is a humbling experience. In all my years here as a student and then a teacher, I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to speak at a devotional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This situation reminds me of a Tongan proverb I learned as a child growing up in Tonga.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tongan Proverb:</p>
<p>’ufilei fie ‘ufi “baby yam trying to be a big yam”</p>
<p>At this moment, I feel like a baby yam that is playing at being a big yam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bring up this proverb not only as a metaphor for my situation today, but as an introduction to who I am.</p>
<p>The origin of the aforementioned proverb is Tongan. I was born and raised in Tonga by goodly parents. My mother was Hawaiian and my father Tongan. They met here at church college of Hawaii as students, and married in the Hawaii LDS temple, then returned to Tonga to teach and work in the Church Educational System. It was always my dream to come to BYUH, which I did as soon as I graduated from Liahona High School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My parents were a fulfillment of President David O. McKay’s promise that this school would produce leaders. They were leaders in Tonga that many people looked up to. My parents were a great example to me of what I should aim to be. I can’t help but feel like a ‘ufilei (young baby yam) in comparison to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I share with you my background because the allegory or story that I’m about to explain is a very important part of my Tongan heritage and a very big part of my own family traditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Allegory of the Yam:</span></strong></p>
<p>As a child growing up in Tonga, ‘ufi or yam, was a main staple in our household. My father was a yam farmer just like his father before him. Dinners usually consisted of yam, which was normally cooked in coconut milk, and some kind of delicious meat dish carefully prepared by my mother. I would like to note that Tongan yams are not to be mistaken for what many people here in America call the sweet potato. They are two very different things.</p>
<p>This tuberous root can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow up to 6 feet in length. The outer skin is dark brown in color, and the inside, a soft substance that can range in color from white or yellow to purple or pink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Tonga, the yam is a valuable commodity because of all the hours of labor put into it. It typically takes 10 months to a year for it to grow. There are many varieties of yam grown in Tonga. In an interview with my father, he listed at least 14 different varieties of yam. Of the long variety are the: kahokaho, kaumeile, takulevu, kapakau’ikava, kivi, solomone, and lose. Of the short variety are the: mahoa’a, voli, paholo, Hawaii, kulo, manisela, and ‘ufilei. Of those 14 mentioned, 7 grow deep into the ground, while the other 7 grow similarly to sweet potato or kumala.</p>
<p>The planting process is usually between the months of June and September. There are two harvest seasons. The main harvest season or as the Tongans call it, Ta’ulahi, is 10 months to a year after planting, so if you plant in August, your harvest season will be in July of the following year. The smaller harvest season, Tokamu’a or Fakapeito, is 7 to 8 months after planting, so if you plant in June, harvest falls during Christmas. This crop is not usually as impressive in size and weight as the main harvest crop.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seed Yams:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> To grow yams, you need seed yams. Seed yams are cut from a mature yam. Every part of the yam can become a seed yam. One yam can yield many yams depending on its size. The yams produced from the body of the seed yam reach up to three feet. However, the head of the yam (where the leaves grow), or a whole average size yam, planted as a seed yam, can grow up to six feet in length. The best seed yams are ones from your own harvest.</p>
<p>As a yam farmer you have to decide if you want to grow short and fat yams, or long yams. As I previously mentioned, there are different types of yams, long and short. Once the farmer has decided on his choice of yam he prepares the land. The holes that are dug in preparation need to match the seed yam. If you are planting a seed yam from the body of the yam, the hole will be about three feet deep. For the seed yam that is the head of the yam (where the leaves grow), the depth of the hole needs to be deeper than three feet. Many farmers, like my dad, will dig the hole to its maximum potential, which is six feet in depth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After digging the hole, the hole is filled to the top with loose top soil. The seed yam is laid down at the top of the loose top soil which now fills the hole. The seed yam is then covered under a mound of dirt to protect it from the rain and the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Felei” or Support: In addition to the mound of dirt is another layer called “felei.” “Felei” are thick plants with many branches that are laid over the dirt to act as nature’s trellis to catch the vines that grow from the yam. The “felei” keeps the leaves of the yam off the ground. One way to kill a yam quickly is to let the yam leaves burn on the hot ground. If there are no leaves, there are no roots.</p>
<p>During the months after planting the farmer will often visit the yams to clear out the weeds. The more visits the better. In my father’s words:</p>
<p>’Ufi is a special kind of plant. Manako ma’u pe ‘ufi ki he mafana koia koe ‘oe sino ‘ae tangata. (The yam likes the heat and warmth that radiates from the presence of people around them). They like people who are planting them to be present all the time. When it is hot they love the person who grew them to be present, moving their leaves, moving part of the soil, they feel it. If the ‘ufi is neglected, they will not grow well, or “foha” (bear fruit).”&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my father, the best “foha” or crop, is the one whose owner was always present during its growing stage. The lack of attention of a farmer can cause the ‘ufi to not “foha” or produce. He says yams want to be yams, “’oku fie ‘ufi ae ‘ufi,” because of the special care they receive from their growers. It is interesting to note that “foha” also means “son” in Tongan.</p>
<p>“Mahunu”: Another important stage of the growth of the yam is knowing when to leave the yam alone. During the rainy season, farmers know to keep away from the yams. This is called “mahunu.” Digging and weeding during rainy season can actually kill the yams. This is because the activity of digging can splash mud onto the stem and leaves of the yam, and when the sun eventually appears, it burns the mud on the leaves, killing the leaves. This kills the yam because without the leaves, the roots die.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harvest Season:</span> </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Growing season ends and harvest season begins around ten months to a year after planting. Harvesting yam is hard work as the long yams need to be dug out of its six foot home. The process can take half an hour or more. It takes special skill to remove the yam from its home without scarring or breaking it. For storing, long yams can be stood on its end. The end closest to the ground will spoil first. If the yam rests on its head, the yams roots will begin to grow in the ground, this is better for storing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many Tongans, the harvest time is a time for celebration. Farmers will gather their yams and compete for the best looking yam: longest, heaviest, and overall prettiest. During special events held by the royal family or nobles of the land, farmers will gather their best yams to offer up as gifts. Any other gift is considered a lesser gift. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interpretation:</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, one way to interpret this allegory is to look at the whole story as a representation of our life here on earth. The farmer is Heavenly Father. We are the yams. He has “planted” us here on earth and knows what we are capable of. He knows our potential. It is up to us to “grow” to that potential. As stated by Alma (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Alma 42:10</a>) “this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.” Also, just like the Tongan proverb, “’oku fie ‘ufi ‘ae ‘ufi,” or “yams want to be yams” because of the special care they receive from their owners, we also find comfort at the presence of Heavenly Father in our life. His presence allows us to become the best versions of ourselves. Lastly, once we have grown to adulthood, just as the seed yams are produced from a mature yam, we also can produce our own “foha,” or children, and fulfill the commandment made to our first parents of multiplying and replenishing the earth.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret this allegory is by looking at some of the lessons that can be learned through the process of farming yam. The Tongan yam farmer knows that the best seed yams are the ones from his own harvest. This is likened to how a father knows that the best lessons are the ones planted through their own example. Two such lessons planted by my father are the lessons of hard work and faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another lesson that can be pulled from the farming process mentioned earlier is that of anticipating your harvest. The farmer anticipated the potential growth of the yam and dug to a depth that reflected that potential. We also can show our Heavenly Father our faith in Him by becoming the best versions of ourselves that He knows we can become.</p>
<p>The rest of my talk will focus on these three lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeds of Hard Work: &nbsp;To understand the first two lessons lets revisit the story of the yam. As I explained previously, yams take ten months to one year to grow. It is labor intensive and grueling work. It cannot be done alone. It takes many people to plant and maintain a yam farm. Not many people choose to grow yams for this very reason. However, my father chose yams because of the lesson of hard work he wanted to sow in my brothers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have five brothers and keeping them busy, so they stayed out of trouble was a priority for my father. He was never an idle man. I remember him always hard at work. He put into practice the principle (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">D&amp;C 58:27</a>) “[of being] anxiously engaged in a good cause,” and taught all of his children the importance of “laboring with [our] own hands” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">D&amp;C 56:17</a>). He truly believed in the saying (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-thes/3.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>) “that if any would not work, neither should he eat.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical day in Tonga was to wake up early in the morning, read scriptures, shower, eat breakfast, say family prayer, go to school, come home, go to the bush (for the boys), clean house and cook (for the girls), eat dinner, do homework, shower, and then sleep. There was no time to be idle. My dad believed that living off of the fruits of the land like breadfruit, or cassava (which I understand takes very little work to grow), made a man lazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teaching the boys how to farm yam was my father’s way of keeping them out of trouble but also his way of sowing seeds of hard work. Today all five of my brothers are hard workers. Three of my brothers live in Utah. They work very hard to provide for their families. I have one brother, a marine, stationed in Japan. His job speaks for itself. I also have a brother here in Hawaii, he also works tirelessly to provide for his growing family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeds of Faith: In addition to sowing seeds of hard work, my parents sowed seeds of faith. They both taught me the importance of living the gospel principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a child, I remember I couldn’t understand the language of the Book of Mormon, and that upset me because every family home evening my mother would give a quiz on a chapter from the Book of Mormon. I wanted to take the quiz, but I couldn’t understand the Book of Mormon (you can see the seeds of teaching were planted in me at a very young age). My mother found for me a copy of the Book of Mormon that was in simple English. She could have very easily had said “wait till you grow up and you’ll understand,” however, she found a copy that I could understand, which showed me how important I was to her. She gave of her time, her knowledge, and her experience, just like the farmer, and like the yam who wants to be a yam (‘ufi fie ‘ufi), I bloomed and grew in the gospel.</p>
<p>My parents planted the seeds of faith when they taught the importance of prayer, scriptural study, family home evening, attending church meetings, fulfilling church callings, doing service, fasting, paying tithing, visiting teaching, home teaching, missionary work, the list goes on. They taught through example. We have a family song that my mother wrote for our family as a mission statement to remind us of who we are and our purpose here on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It follows the tune of Give Said the Little Stream:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moleni Family Song</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By Ana Kahililani LaBarre Moleni</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are the Moleni, family as you see<br />Pate, Remi, Anela, too, <br />Nini, Leola, and Georgie, <br />John, Dan, Alana, Ana, Tuki, and George<br />An eternal family.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chorus:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Learning, missions, temple work,<br />Is our goal, here on Earth.<br />Family love will always last<br />When we pray and fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kapau te tau lava ke hoko ko ha mama,<br />[If we can become a light]<br />‘I he ‘e tau lea, mo ho tau ‘ulunganga.<br />[In our words and actions]<br />Ke tau ‘ofa, fie tokoni, talangofua, moe fai lelei,<br />[To love, want to help, be obedient, do good]<br />‘Oku tau hoko leva ai, ko ha mama ngingila<br />[We will become a bright shining light]&nbsp;</p>
<p>My parents followed the commandment issued in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40?lang=eng#39" target="_blank">D&amp;C 93:40</a> that states: “But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.”</p>
<p>Let’s return for a moment back to the yam story. If you remember, after planting the seed yams, a farmer will cover the seed yam with a mound of dirt and then lay branches over the mound of dirt to support the yam leaves as they begin to sprout out of the ground. Without that layer of support, or “felei” as the Tongans call it, the yam leaves will lay on the dirt and be burned by the intensity of the sun. This is a sure way to kill the yam as it cannot survive without its leaves.</p>
<p>The lessons and church principles that my parents taught our family to live by are like the “felei” that is laid over the growing yam. These church principles like prayer, family home evening and so forth protected and strengthened us children while we were yet young, so that when the time was right, we could stand on our own. That early support system resulted in all 9 children serving missions and 8 marrying in the temple (I have one brother who is not married.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the “felei” or the support provided by parents, friends, church programs, and so on, will not prevent the weeds, the insects, or the hot sun from appearing. We will still face trials. We will still face hardship. It will be our responsibility as an adult, after we have left the care of parents and home, to take the seeds of faith planted in us and cultivate it as Alma stated in: (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Alma 32:28</a>)</p>
<p>"Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me."</p>
<p>As we cultivate the seeds of faith planted in us by our parents and teachers, we can become “felei” to our own children and to those who are in need of shade and support from the blistering fire of adversity that none of us can escape from.</p>
<p>Your True Potential: If you remember from my yam story, during the planting stage, the farmer will dig a hole to the size that he anticipates the yam will grow. If the farmer plants a long yam in a three foot hole, the yam will grow down until it hits the hard floor - the three foot marker - and stop growing. Most farmers, like my dad, will dig a hole to the maximum length of six feet in anticipation of the yam growing to that length.</p>
<p>Like the yam farmer and his hope that his yam will grow to reach its maximum potential, our earthly and Heavenly Father both want us to reach our maximum potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reach our potential we need to have a clear understanding of who we are and where we came from. Elder Nelson speaks on this point when he says:</p>
<p>"It is important to know who you are and who you may become. It is more important than what you do, vital as your work is. You pursue an education to prepare for life’s work, but you also need to prepare for life—eternal life. I emphasize this because some people on life’s journey forget who they really are and what is really important. Without sure identity and priority, blessings that matter most are at the mercy of things that matter least." (<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/russell-m-nelson_identity-priority-blessings/" target="_blank">Elder Russell M. Nelson</a>)</p>
<p>Knowing who you are and where you come from is very important in Tongan culture. In Tonga it is customary at a first meeting of a stranger to ask for their genealogy. “What is your name? Who are your parents? Who are your grandparents? What island are you from?” Such are the types of questions you could be asked. This is their way of identifying a person and of making connections. It is very difficult to get in trouble in Tonga because everyone knows who you are and who your parents are. Any misdeeds will always get reported back to them.</p>
<p>A Tongan’s identity is strongly tied to their name and that name is tied to their past. How many of you know a Mele? Or a Sione? These names were not given because there were no other names around. These names have been passed down from generation to generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This naming tradition is a common theme in the Book of Mormon. One example is that of the brothers Nephi and Lehi. Their father Helaman tells them:</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.6-7?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Helaman 5:6-7</a> it reads:</p>
<p>"… Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</p>
<p>7 Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them."</p>
<p>Helaman’s hope was that by giving his sons the names of their ancestors, they would be reminded of what good they could do and thus fulfill a parents hope of their child doing good in life.</p>
<p>A name can be a promise. A promise to live up to. Just as the depth of the hole to plant the yam is the potential of the size of the yam, the name given to a child represents the hope the parents have that their child will realize their potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two daughters and as is usual in the Tongan culture, the names given to them have special meaning. Both my daughters were named in honor of their ancestors. My eldest daughter’s first name, Kahililani, is the middle name of my Hawaiian mother. This name was given to my mother by her own mother. It represents her Hawaiian heritage. My daughter’s second name is Kaye, this name represents her palangi or haole side and is the middle name of my husband’s mother. My daughter’s third name is Fetutuki. This name is Tongan. Fetutuki is the middle name of my step-mother, who married my Dad after my mother passed away when I was eight years old. My step-mother took on the role of mother to nine children when she married my dad. The last name that is part of my daughter’s identity is Solis. This name is Mexican and represents her Mexican heritage. My husband’s family is part Mexican on the father’s side.</p>
<p>My youngest daughter was also given a family name. Her middle name, Malia, is to honor all the Marys and Meles on both sides of the family, as there are many.</p>
<p>These names were given to my daughters as a tribute to those who came before them and as a reminder to do good, just as Helaman’s naming of his sons, Nephi and Lehi, were a reminder for them to do good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In life, others will give us names. As a child, I was labeled a “hafikasi” (half-Tongan), as a teenager, I was labeled a “fiepalangi” (wannabe white person), and as an adult a “Tongan.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on what community of practice, or subculture, we are a part of, we may carry the name of daughter, sister, wife, mother, woman. I am all of those. I am also Tongan, Hawaiian, American, hafikasi, fiepalangi. In a different setting I am a student, teacher, colleague, friend, employee of BYUH, Mormon and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have different names that identify who we are. Because our identity is fluid and changes according to the community of practices we are a part of, we can become confused as to which name to follow. If we choose the wrong name to follow, we can be like the farmer that chooses to limit the yam to three feet instead of aiming for the maximum potential of six feet. Elder Oaks warns us of this when he says:</p>
<p>We have our agency, and we can choose any characteristic to define us. But we need to know that when we choose to define ourselves or to present ourselves by some characteristic that is temporary or trivial in eternal terms, we de-emphasize what is most important about us and we overemphasize what is relatively unimportant. This can lead us down the wrong path and hinder our eternal progress. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2013/06/how-to-define-yourself?lang=eng" target="_blank">Elder Dallin H. Oaks</a>)</p>
<p>Out of all the names that we use to define ourselves, I think the name that best defines who we are and helps us realize our true potential is that of “child of God.” Knowing that we are His child should free us to become the best versions of ourselves that He knows we can be. Every day of our life we should remember President Packer’s words:</p>
<p>You are a child of God. He is the father of your spirit. Spiritually you are of noble birth, the offspring of the King of Heaven. Fix that truth in your mind and hold to it. However many generations in your mortal ancestry, no matter what race or people you represent, the pedigree of your spirit can be written on a single line. You are a child of God!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/to-young-women-and-men?lang=eng" target="_blank">(President Boyd K. Packer)</a></p>
<p>Knowing who we are gives us a better understanding of where we are going. We are His children. He has created us in His image. He knows us and knows what we can do. He has not put limits on what we can do. So, we should not put limits on what we can do, but instead, aim, like the farmer, on obtaining our maximum potential.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters. I hope that the lessons shared with you today provide some guidance in your journey on this earth. I hope that the story of the sowing seeds of hard work and faith inspire you to be a good example to those around you. I hope that you have the chance to offer shade and shelter to friends and family and be offered the same in return, so that the sting of adversity is lessened. It is my prayer that you remember that you are a child of God. That we were sent here to this earth by Him. That we have the capacity to become like him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>January 12, 2016 <br />Roy Bauer <br />Former Fiji Suva Mission President<br /> Former Hilo Hawaii Stake President<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>President and Sister Tanner, Administration, Faculty, Staff, and Students of Brigham Young University-Hawaii; Aloha! It is great to be back in Hawaii. Last August we moved to California after, for myself with my younger mission, spending nearly forty years living in the Pacific Islands. We have lived as a family in Fiji, Kiribati, Guam, here on Oahu, in Hilo on the Big Island, and for a few months in New Zealand. As a younger missionary, I also lived in the Cook Islands. We lived on Oahu for four years and in Hilo for twenty-five years excluding three years as the Fiji Suva Mission President and our nearly two year couple mission to Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We miss Hawaii and the wonderful people here. We are so blessed to have family here with our daughter Laura, our son-in-law Liam, and four fantastic grandchildren. Families are so important! It reminds me of the story of little Nathan who was an only child who wanted desperately to have a brother to play with. So in his prayers he always asked for a little brother. After many months with nothing happening, Nathan finally gave up. Soon after that, his mother became pregnant, and eventually went to the hospital where she had twin boys. “My heavens!” Nathan exclaimed when he heard the news. “It’s a good thing I stopped praying when I did.”</p>
<p>A father was trying to read the newspaper. His young son wanted to play with his father. To keep the boy busy, Dad pulled a full-page map of the world out of the current events section of the newspaper, cut it up into fairly small jigsaw pieces, scattered them on the floor, and said to his little son, “See if you can put these back together as a map of the world. Just follow the colors and shapes.” The father had barely begun to read his newspaper when he felt his son tugging at his sleeve. In about three minutes this young boy had reassembled the map correctly. How did you do that? asked his father. I got a clue, his little son said. On the other side of the page was a big picture of a family. All I had to do was to put the family together and the world fell into place.”</p>
<p>It is true that the traditional family today has come under attack from many sides. We need to continue to stand steadfast in support of the family as the Lord has ordained. In Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, we find great counsel regarding the family: In<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/5.25?lang=eng#24" target="_blank"> Ephesians 5:25</a>, we read “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.” In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.1?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:1</a> we read, “Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Verse 2</a>:“Honor thy father and mother . . . “<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/6.4?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Verse 4</a>: “. . . fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng" target="_blank">Family: A Proclamation To The World</a>, we read in the 6th paragraph, “Husbands and wives have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. Children are an heritage of the Lord (Psalm 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Paragraph 7 we read, “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Shortly after moving to California, I was invited by dear friends, Inoke and Ateca Suguturaga, to be part of the circle for the naming and blessing of their new grandson born to their son Sivo and his wife Luana. We were honored to be so invited and traveled to the Patterson Ward for the sacred event this past September. After Church, we were invited to Sivo and Luana’s home for the haircutting ceremony of another grandson. After the ceremony, we partook along with the others invited to a fantastic Fijian feast. So many fond memories flooded our minds and our hearts.</p>
<p>Around thirty-five years ago while serving as a branch president in Fiji. I often went home teaching with my favorite companion, Sister Bauer, in searching out particularly the less active members of the branch--male and female. We came across Inoke and Ateca’s home in our looking for the home of Inoke’s less-active cousin. Inoke was not home at the time so we visited with Ateca. A very strong impression came to me to ask Ateca to receive the missionaries and to be taught the gospel. At first, I put the impression aside with the reasoning that we had just met this young lady, Ateca. However, the impression came back even stronger and I could literally feel my heart beat within my chest. I invited Ateca to receive the missionaries and she accepted the invitation. Both Ateca and Inoke were taught by the missionaries. The rest is, as they say, history. Three generations of the family are now in the gospel. The Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ can indeed bring great happiness and success. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Quentin L. Cook, an Apostle of the Lord, related about a longitudinal study conducted over approximately seventy years with the goal to find out as much as possible about success and happiness. He related this in his talk entitled, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/07/reaping-the-rewards-of-righteousness.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Rewards of Righteousness</a>” delivered at the BYU Women’s Conference on May 2nd, 2014 and included in the July 2015 Ensign. Here are some results of the study:</p>
<p>-College entrance scores and grade averages did not predict either success or happiness in later life.</p>
<p>-Childhood family happiness had a high correlation with happy, successful adults.</p>
<p>-In particular, the mothers of these children verbally expressed love and affection and did not use severe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;discipline.</p>
<p>-Both parents were demonstratively affectionate with each other and&nbsp;available and accessible to their children, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with whom they had warm and&nbsp;emotionally expressive relationships.</p>
<p>-The parents created a stable family environment and were believed to&nbsp;have respected the autonomy of their &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A concluding book on the study published in 2012 reported: “. . . A warm childhood correlates with achievement more than intelligence, social class, or athleticism.”</p>
<p>My doctoral dissertation of over twenty years ago is entitled “Factors Affecting the Academic Success of Pacific Island International Students.” Brigham Young University Hawaii Pacific Island International students were my focus group. There were a number of factors that I looked at including English language proficiency, socioeconomic status, college credits completed, area of origin, gender, marital status, and type of secondary education (American, British, or French). The study concluded that none of these factors were significant in determining the academic success of the Pacific Island International students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three significant factors were autonomy, self-confidence, and attitude combined with effort. It seems to me these three significant factors are very much instilled in a happy home with a happy childhood when gospel principles are taught and practiced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From August 2012 to July 2014, Sister Bauer and I had the blessing of serving a mission in Turkey. We came to love the wonderful people of Turkey. Turkey is 99.8% Muslim but the Istanbul Turkey Branch President, Murat Cakir, has stated that 75-80% of the Muslims in Turkey are in name only-or we might say “Jack Muslims.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever we have served on the Mainland U.S., in the Pacific Islands, or in Turkey-the children are for the most part the same and are for the most part happy, fun-loving, and appreciative of their loving parents and their brothers and sisters. I would venture to say this is true for all children in all the nations of the world.<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.37?lang=eng#36" target="_blank"> Alma 26:37</a> states, “. . . we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth . . . “ It is indeed very sad when much too often children are taught to hate and have prejudice against other religions and cultures.</p>
<p>I remember an <a href="http://childbiblesongs.com/song-30-jesus-loves-the-little-children.shtml" target="_blank">old song</a> that used to go:</p>
<p>“Jesus loves the little children; all the children of the world; red and yellow, black and white; makes no difference in his sight; Jesus loves the little children of the world.”</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated at Disneyland with the exhibition, “It’s A Small World”, with all the little child mannequins dressed in their cultural attire. Over this past Thanksgiving, we had the opportunity to visit Disneyland and I particularly wanted to go see this exhibit in preparation for this address. We were again impressed with the theme that it is indeed a small world after all as represented by the children of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the last year of our couple mission in Turkey, we lived in a traditional Turkish neighborhood and it was wonderful. We lived on the fifth and top floor of an apartment building with no elevator. Ladies in the neighborhood would lower their baskets by rope when a produce cart would pass by putting their money for the purchase in the bucket and the produce vendor after taking the money would then put the produce in the bucket for the lady to haul up to her apartment. Children played soccer in the narrow streets of our traditional Turkish neighborhood and sheep were herded at times through the narrow streets. For the most part, the Turkish people were very honest, friendly, and helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>İstanbul, the largest city in Turkey is a big city. Formally it has 13.9 million-but at any one time there are 20 million including Syrian and other refugees, migrant workers (many from the Philippines and Africa), and tourists mainly from Europe and Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example of how honesty is a guiding principle in Turkish society, the İstanbul Branch President’s son’s friend accidentally left his backpack with his computer in it on a subway seat and the next morning, he was able to go back and find it untouched where he had left it. &nbsp;Often the buses are very crowded so the people get on the back of the bus and pass their travel card or money up to the bus driver through all the people to the front and the card or change is then passed back. When someone falls walking on the streets, many gather around to give a helping hand with bottled water, assisting them in getting up, and making sure they are okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had many Muslim friends in Turkey-most of whom did not speak English. One was the brother of the real estate agent who helped us find apartments for a set of our Elders and Couples. Zekeriya, the brother of our real estate agent, ran a small, humble hardware store. We would have long conversations with him about Gospel values. We would speak in our broken Turkish and he would help us with our language. One day he asked my wife to sing to him-she got me to join her. We sang to him, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/i-am-a-child-of-god?lang=eng" target="_blank">I Am a Child of God</a>” in English. He liked the tune, although he did not understand the words; however, we could see he was touched by the Spirit of this beloved song. The next time we visited him we took the Turkish lyrics. After reading over the lyrics, he looked up and with a smile on his face said, “Problem!” The word “problem,” by the way, is the same in Turkish and English.</p>
<p>In Islam, they believe we are not children of God because to them God, Allah, is an ethereal being-in other words, an essence. Of course, we know that God is our loving Heavenly Father and we are His literal Spirit children. With that said, many Muslims are very Christ-like in their actions. One other note: Muslims accept Jesus Christ as a prophet but not as the Son of God for the reason as stated they do not believe God has a physical body. They do, believe, however, that there will be a Second Coming of Jesus Christ. They truly have elements of the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Church in Turkey is blessing many of God’s children there. We were officially recognized as an Association on 19 October 2011, not really that long ago. We were not recognized as a Church, however, as they only recognize churches established before Turkey became a Republic in 1923. Before that Turkey was part of the Ottoman Empire. Churches recognized besides Muslim are Jewish, Roman Catholic, and Greek Orthodox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our recognition as an Association in October 2011, we were then able to bring in four young Elders in February 2012. However, due to visa challenges these four young Elders had to leave in July 2012. From the early 1990s, we have had humanitarian couples in Turkey but not proselyting missionaries. We arrived in August 2012 and the next four Elders came in October 2012. We now have sixteen young Elders in Turkey. I was assigned during our mission as a counselor in the Bulgaria Sofia Mission Presidency (Turkey was then part of the Bulgaria Sofia Mission) with responsibility for Turkey. I was assigned by the Area Presidency as the Association President. We traveled around Turkey to train in the four branches of the Church in Turkey under the direction of the Bulgaria Sofia Mission President-Michael Wilstead. Besides the İstanbul Branch there are four other branches including the Ankara Branch, the Izmir Branch, the Gaziantep Branch, and the Adana Branch. The Adana Branch is on the Incırlık Air Force Base and is a military branch. It is located near the Syrian border.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Istanbul, Turkey is the headquarters for the Central Eurasian Mission as of last July. The Central Eurasian Mission consists of besides Turkey; Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The Central Eurasian Mission President is James Toronto, himself being a scholar of Islam.</p>
<p>The young Elders meet people on the public transportation systems-the subways, the trains, the ferries, the buses, and in parks. The Elders do not go out in public with their name tags nor do they track or street contact. They are, however, constantly teaching investigators who learn about the Church through the internet or talking with the Elders on the public transportation systems.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about three Turkish converts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one is Murat Çakır who is serving currently as the İstanbul Branch President. Murat grew up as a Muslim but his parents were not active in the Mulsim religion. He started going to the mosque as a young man but knew something was missing. One day, he prayed to God that if He would help him find that which was missing, he would dedicate his life to Him. Murat’s grandmother was a very devout Muslim. She would often say, “God always protects and blesses those who have faith in Him.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At age sixteen, in Istanbul, Murat started studying international relations. Murat received a scholarship to study in Norway. In Norway at the age of seventeen, Murat had the opportunity to learn about Christianity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One evening when Murat was in his room in the dorms at the university, he had a strong impression to get out of his room. As he did, he saw two men in suits and overcoats passing his door. He felt a strong prompting to talk with them. These two men dressed in suits and overcoats were missionaries from the Church. Murat took the missionary lessons. As Murat prayed, he knew that their message was true. He felt a special peace in receiving the lessons and in going to Church. Murat was converted at the age of twenty. He enjoyed sharing the Gospel with others. He was called to be a stake missionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murat decided to become a full-time missionary but realized this would mean leaving Norway resulting in his losing his deferment status to study in Norway again. When Murat joined the Church, there was only one Turkish member residing in Turkey. Going on a mission also meant that Murat would most likely be obligated by the Turkish Government to serve in the military for eighteen months which could easily result in his fighting terrorists in the mountain regions of Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1989, Murat left his education and sold everything he had to serve a mission. He was called to serve in Arizona. Murat’s parents were totally against him going on a mission. However, he knew that this is what the Lord wanted him to do. At the age of twenty-two, Murat began his mission. He devoted himself completely in the service of the Lord for the next two years. Being close to the Spirit, Murat had a dream on his mission that his grandmother would pass on in a week. This was followed by another dream two weeks later that she had died. This was confirmed in a letter Murat received from his mother shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Murat’s mission, his passport was about to expire and his embassy refused to renew it as he was not a worker or student. Murat’s mission president had him apply to BYU-Provo whereupon Murat received a four-year scholarship. Murat was able to finish his two-year mission plus one month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At BYU, Murat was able to help out with the translation of the Book of Mormon into Turkish which took six years. During this time of translation, many miracles occurred in the translation process. In 2001, the Book of Mormon was published in Turkish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At BYU, Murat met his to-be eternal companion, Susan. They now have five children and all are dual-citizens. After attending graduate school and taking a job in the Middle East for a time, the family moved to Turkey in August of 2008 from Provo without any job prospects. Upon their second day in Turkey, Susan was offered a position at a private Turkish school with full scholarships for their five children. Murat started working for the Translation Department of the Church. He is currently working on translating the Doctrine and Covenants into Turkish. Murat has served as the Istanbul Branch President for over the past six years.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>The second convert I’d like to mention - Adem Kocaman. Adem saw the tag on a wheelchair that read “LDS Charities.” He researched out LDS and contacted the then Humanitarian Missionary Couple, was taught and baptized. Adem is a young single adult working on his doctorate in Human Genetics. He serves as the First Counselor in the İstanbul Branch Presidency. He travels every other week to İstanbul to attend Church all the way from Samsun on the Black Sea where he attends university, a ten hour bus ride each way. &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The third convert, Mine Aşkan, is the İstanbul Branch Relief Society President. She was converted in the country of Malta along with her husband and three sons. Her husband served as a branch president for a time in Malta but sadly went less-active along with her sons. In fact, her husband did not want Mine to go to Church but she, on the other hand, wanted desperately to go to Church. Her husband would at times even physically restrain her from going to Church. She then would wait until her husband was asleep on Saturday evening and then sneak out of the house around midnight or in the very early hours Sunday morning and go sit in a hotel lobby near the branch meetinghouse until the branch building opened on Sunday morning. She is a great member-missionary in Istanbul at her work explaining to others why she has a special glow about her. Mine has given Books of Mormon out to many neighbors in her apartment building. By the way, in her patriarchal blessing it states she is of the lineage of the tribe of Napthali, one of the ten lost tribes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Turkish culture is rich with music, dance, dress, food, and traditions. We need to appreciate all cultures. You may be sitting with your friends, but if there is someone sitting behind you or in front of you that you do not know, take this time now to introduce yourself, ask them their name, where they are from, and have them tell you one of their cultural traits they appreciate. You now have a minute to do that. While you are doing that, here is a picture of the children of Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The late Elder Richard G. Scott, an Apostle of the Lord, in his April 1998 General Conference address <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/04/removing-barriers-to-happiness?lang=eng" target="_blank">“Removing Barriers To Happiness</a>” said, “Appreciation of ethnic, cultural, or national heritage can be very wholesome and beneficial, but it can also perpetuate patterns of life that should be set aside by a devoted Latter-day Saint.” Elder Scott later in his talk said, “Your Heavenly Father assigned you to be born into a specific lineage from which you have received your inheritance of race, culture, and traditions. That lineage can provide a rich heritage and great reasons to rejoice. Yet you have the responsibility to determine if there is any part of that heritage that must be discarded because it works against the Lord’s plan of happiness.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some traditions counter to the Gospel that Elder Scott pointed out are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1-Where the husband exerts a domineering, authoritarian role. Both husband and wife, on the other hand, need to act as equal partners, making decisions in unity for themselves and their family. Love is the foundation of a happy family. <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2-Violations of the Word of Wisdom.</p>
<p>3-Forcing others to comply by the power of status often determined by heredity.</p>
<p>4-The establishment of caste systems&nbsp;</p>
<p>5-Anything that breeds conflicts with other cultures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Scott concluded by saying, “Where family or national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished and followed to preserve your culture and heritage.”</p>
<p>What can we do to appreciate cultures different from our own:</p>
<p>1-Be Positive. Celebrate the good in each culture.</p>
<p>2-Be Non-Judgmental</p>
<p>3-Learn at least basic elements of the language of that culture</p>
<p>The most important culture above all cultures is, of course, “The Gospel Culture.”</p>
<p>In the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament it states in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/7.14?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">Chapter 7, verse 14</a>:“And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” In Acts written by <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.34-35?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">Luke in Chapter 10, Verses 34 and 35</a> we read: “Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness is accepted with him.” Alma declares in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Alma 13:22</a>, “Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all &nbsp; nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 115:5</a> states, “Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations.”<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mission president in the Fiji Suva Mission and in our mission in Turkey, the most happy and successful missionaries totally immersed themselves in the culture they were serving in by:</p>
<p>-Diligently learning the language of the people,</p>
<p>-Enjoying the local food,</p>
<p>-Developing manners appropriate to the culture. For example, taking off your shoes before entering a home which is common both in the cultures in the Pacific Islands and in Turkey as well as in many other cultures of the world. At a funeral of a Hawaiian friend we attended last year, the brother of my friend stated that when they were children their father treated them to a movie for the first time. At the movie theatre in their seats, the father looked down and asked them, “Where are your flip flops?” The children responded, “Oh, we left them at the door coming in.” In Turkey, it is not appropriate to lay your scriptures on the floor. Also, it is ill manners to show the soles of your feet to someone. Women must have their heads covered when entering a mosque.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to respect the cultures and religions of others. While on our mission in Turkey, the mission president invited Sister Bauer and myself to join Elder Steven E. Snow, Church Historian; Sister Snow, and two brethren from the Church History Department to cultural sites around Turkey. Among the sites we visited was the Sultanahmet or Blue Mosque in Istanbul. Upon entering this historic magnificent mosque, we felt a special peace. Elder Snow commented about the very peaceful feeling in this sacred structure. We also had the opportunity to visit Ephesus where the Apostle Paul taught. Ephesus dates back to three thousand B.C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">2 Nephi Chapter 26 in the last half of verse 33</a> states, “. . . he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he rememberth the heathen; and all are alike unto God. . . “<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/52.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Isaiah 52:10</a> relates the words of Isaiah, “All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.”</p>
<p>We Are All Children of God. He loves all His children. If you say to yourself, “Well, I did not grow up in a loving home”, or, “it is hard for me to leave some of those traditions of my culture behind which are counter to the Gospel”--then know that one of the primary doctrines of the Gospel is “Agency” and you can choose the right and you can, when the time comes for you who are yet single, raise children in a loving, happy home with a foundation of gospel principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are a child of God. Your righteous desires can indeed be realized. Heavenly Father loves you. We love you. You are indeed the great hope of the future for yourselves, your families, your culture, and the growth of the Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that this is indeed the Lord’s Church with Him, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, at its head. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. President Thomas S. Monson is our Living Prophet. We are, indeed, all children of God and He loves all of us and loves everyone throughout the world irrespective of what culture or religion they are a part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media160105<br><title>People Count, Things Don&#039;t  | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>January 5, 2016 <br />Kathy Pulotu <br />Institutional Research &amp; Assessment Manager, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I am truly humbled and grateful for the opportunity to speak here today. I was born and raised right here in Laie on Iosepa Street. &nbsp;I graduated from Kahuku High School and then attended this great institution of BYU-Hawaii. &nbsp;I love the experience I had here, the friends I made, the education I received, and how my testimony of the gospel grew. I recall the moments I spent here in the CAC at devotionals with reverence and fondness. &nbsp;I felt the spirit touch my soul and learned many great lessons of the gospel, the atonement, and about life in general right here in devotionals. I prayed and pondered about what I could share with you today that would be of worth, what is the best that I have to offer? And it came to me clearly: the most valuable thing I have, besides the gospel of Jesus Christ, is the people in my life. My husband, my children, mine and my husband’s parents, my siblings, my extended family, my friends and my whole community, really.</p>
<p>The mural at the front of the McKay foyer is a depiction of the scene that preceded President David O. McKay’s vision of what would be a center for education here in Laie. In 1921 at the local Church grade school he witnessed a flag-raising ceremony by Hawaiian, Haole, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and Filipino students. &nbsp;He said, “That ceremony brought tears to my eyes. Truly the melting pot but more impressive than that was our assembly in the old chapel that stood by… There we met as one, members of the Church, the Restored Church of Christ. What an example in this little place of the purposes of our Father in Heaven to unite all peoples by the gospel of Jesus Christ." (David O. McKay)&nbsp; It’s all about the people.</p>
<p>In the 1958 ground breaking services for the Church College of Hawaii, President McKay explained, “One man said the world needs men who cannot be bought or sold, men who will scorn to violate truth, genuine gold. That is what this school is going to produce." (David O. McKay) Again, people. People with character and integrity.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>If you will notice, the slogan underneath the mural reads, Ua Mau Ke Ea o Ka Aina i Ka Pono, which has been adopted as the Hawaii state slogan and is commonly translated from Hawaiian to mean, &nbsp;“the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.” &nbsp;This is one of the great, true principles we learn from the Book of Mormon. &nbsp;I was thinking about this and realized that if this is true, the life of the land is dependent on it’s people. The righteousness of the people will determine the outcome of the land, or in other words, “da people gotta be pono.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a saying going around on Facebook that I believe embodies what it means to be pono and be genuine gold, “No matter how educated, talented, rich or cool you believe you are, how you treat people ultimately tells all. Integrity is Everything.”</p>
<p>Today I will share with you three principles to help us as we strive to fulfill the prophecy of David O. McKay by making the people and relationships in our lives count. &nbsp;First, people are our treasures. Second, relationships are built on small and simple things. &nbsp;And Third, treasured relationships require selfless service and even sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>People, not things, are our treasures</strong></p>
<p>Many years ago I saw a magnet at a shop in the airport that read, “Rich is not how much you have, or where you are going, or even what you are; Rich is who you have beside you.” &nbsp;This saying made me feel good, yes, it even made me feel rich!</p>
<p>It reminds of the scripture found in<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.19-21?lang=eng#18" target="_blank"> Matthew 6:19-21</a>.</p>
<p>19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p>
<p>20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>
<p>21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p>In his April 2014 general conference address, Elder Michael Teh explained that building family relationships and serving others are two ways to lay up treasures in heaven. &nbsp;He described how he and his wife visited members in the Philippines in early 2013 after they were devastated by a major earthquake and super typhoon. He said that amidst the destruction, people were filled with gratitude for what little they had and what help they had received. He said,</p>
<p>"In times of calamity or tragedy, the Lord has a way of refocusing us and our priorities. All of a sudden, all the material things we worked so hard to acquire do not matter. All that matters is our family and our relationships with others. One good sister put it this way: “After the water receded and it was time to begin cleaning up, I looked around my home and thought, ‘Wow, I have accumulated a lot of garbage these many years.’”(Michael John U. Teh)</p>
<p>President Monson also taught us that we must learn to recognize what is important and what is not. In his October 2008 Conference talk he said,</p>
<p>"Stresses in our lives come regardless of our circumstances. We must deal with them the best we can. But we should not let them get in the way of what is most important—and what is most important almost always involves the people around us. ...We will never regret the kind words spoken or the affection shown. Rather, our regrets will come if such things are omitted from our relationships with those who mean the most to us." (Thomas S. Monson)</p>
<p>President Monson continued to say,</p>
<p>"Send that note to the friend you’ve been neglecting; give your child a hug; give your parents a hug; say “I love you” more; always express your thanks. Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved. Friends move away, children grow up, loved ones pass on. It’s so easy to take others for granted, until that day when they’re gone from our lives and we are left with feelings of “what if” and “if only.”"(Thomas S. Monson)</p>
<p>It is my father who first taught me this truth. &nbsp;In fact, this statement “People Count, Things Don’t” has been part of our family mission statement since 1975. &nbsp;It is a saying I have heard all my life. &nbsp;I’ve heard family friends refer to it, we even had a framed cross-stitching of this saying in our living room. &nbsp;It sat right next to the “Do it” quote by President Kimball. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since I can remember until I was a junior in college, my dad was serving in either the bishopric or the stake presidency.</p>
<p>My dad not only told me that people count, he showed me by making feel that I count. Despite all his responsibilities at work and at church, he never missed any of our sports games. We always held family home evening and he was available to take us on campouts, mud-sliding in the mountains, to cheer on the Red Raiders at football games, and to beat us at tennis or a game of Pit. It never dawned on me that he might be too busy for those things because he always made the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But most importantly, it is how he reacted to our mistakes that taught me he really lived and believed this principle. One of my earliest memories of this was the time my brother and I left the house after everyone was asleep so we could play in a yard down the street that was decorated for Christmas with large Sesame Street characters. I was 4 or 5 years old and my brother was 6 or 7. He woke me up and asked if I wanted to go to Sesame Street, and I couldn’t pass it up so we went!! &nbsp;Later we were startled to hear the voice of my father talking and laughing with others. He had been at mutual at the chapel and was walking home. My brother and I quickly hid behind the characters, but then I popped my head out and yelled, “Hi daddy!” revealing us. &nbsp;My dad was surprised to see his young children out alone, but I never knew that until much later. &nbsp;What I do remember is that he seemed so happy to see us and walk us home. &nbsp;I didn’t even realize that I should probably get in trouble for visiting Sesame Street that late at night without permission, because what my dad made me feel was loved. That’s what I remember.</p>
<p>Who are the treasures in your life and how do you show them that you treasure them?</p>
<p>My mother-in-law taught me a simple truth in this, you gladly serve those you love. When my husband and I got married, we did not have a wedding reception. This is the way we wanted it. Before our sealing, my mother-in-law kept asking, are you sure you don’t want a party? &nbsp;We said, yes, we don’t want you to have to do all that work, cooking and preparing for a big celebration. &nbsp;And then she said, for you I would love to do it. She continues to show her love through service to us and everyone around her. I know that she sincerely meant it. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Relationships are built on small and simple things&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In Alma 37:7 it reads, “And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.”</p>
<p>Like my father showed me, relationships are built on the small things. President Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p>"God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom. . . . So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds!" (Spencer W. Kimball)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior was a great example of this. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf once told of how he tried to imagine the Savior rushing between meetings and multitasking to get things done and he just couldn’t do it. He said,</p>
<p>"Instead I see the compassionate and caring Son of God purposefully living each day. When He interacted with those around Him, they felt important and loved. He knew the infinite value of the people He met. He blessed them, ministered to them. He lifted them up, healed them. He gave them the precious gift of His time."</p>
<p>Our Savior showed us how he valued the people around him by the small acts of service he performed. He helped at the wedding feast at the request of his mother by making water into wine (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/2.1-11?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">John 2:1-11</a>). He spoke with a woman of Samaria at the well sharing the message of eternal life (John 4:6-26). When the woman with the issue of blood touched his garment he gave encouraging words, “be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/9.20-22?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Matthew 9:20-22</a>). When the disciples turned away the little children that were brought to the Savior he said, “Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come unto me: for such is the kingdom of heaven,” and he blessed them (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/19.13-15?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Matthew 19:13-15</a>). &nbsp;</p>
<p>And one of my favorite examples is when He visited the Nephites after he was resurrected (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng" target="_blank">3 Nephi 17</a>). He delivered his message and saw they did not quite understand so he told them to go home and ponder his words and we would come back again. “And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them. And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.5-6?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">3 Nephi 17:5-6</a>)</p>
<p>Jesus stayed with them. &nbsp;He healed their sick, greeted each person individually, blessed their children, and prayed for them.</p>
<p>This is how we build relationships. It is through the small things, like watching games and spending time with each other. It is through tender mercies and mundane tasks. I have seen innumerable examples in my life that illustrate how the small and simple things make the difference in letting people know that they matter and are important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mother showed us her love through consistent upkeep in the mundane tasks. She kept a tidy house, washed our clothes every day, cooked and cleaned and helped with our homework and met all our basic needs. Talk about mundane tasks. &nbsp;But the security, constancy, and love that flowed through these tasks and her diligent service to our family are priceless to me. I cannot measure the value I received from this service. It was also what she didn’t do that is very important to me, she never complained or expressed frustration or hardship about sitting alone with us kids every Sunday at Church while my dad served in various leadership positions. It was just what you do.</p>
<p>My Aunty Sela Feinga built relationships with everyone around her through always having an open house, open arms, and an open kitchen. &nbsp;She also gives great free advice: Go straight home, don’t go crooked. When we needed leis or costumes she would make them for us, in addition to those she needed to make for her own kids. I still remember having the best looking lei in my whole 4th grade class, thanks to Aunty Sela. &nbsp;How special it made me feel at that young age, I always remember that.</p>
<p>Sometimes these small actions seem like a whim, but I believe they are guidance from the Holy Ghost. Like when my mentor and friend, Rose Ram,well, she’s also my boss, but she was a friend and mentor first, drove all the way into Honolulu Airport to welcome her daughter’s future in-laws with fresh flower leis and a warm aloha. You know me? I would have just waited until they found their way out to Laie to greet them, and leis? &nbsp;They would have enough at the wedding! The best small things are those that you don’t have to do, but people are so glad you did because they make you feel loved.</p>
<p>Those who know my father-in-law know he is a man who would give the shirt off his back to anyone who needs it. He recently expressed his love for serving others and explained how he is always looking for someone he can share with or help out. And then he said something so simple that also makes so much sense, “We cannot help others unless we put ourselves in the position to help.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now you are preparing yourselves, through education, to be in a position to help others. You will leave this school to become leaders and an influence for peace in this world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you put yourself in a position to help right now? We cannot help people if we are holed up in our rooms playing video games or watching movies. &nbsp;No matter how willing we are, we will not be able to see the need or have the spirit guide us to people who need us if we don’t put ourselves where we can help. One step to putting yourself in that position is by attending church meetings and accepting callings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf said,</p>
<p>“If we fail to give our best personal self and undivided time to those who are truly important to us, one day we will regret it. &nbsp;Let us resolve to cherish those we love by spending meaningful time with them, doing things together, and cultivating treasured memories.” (Dieter F. Uchtdorf)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Treasured relationships require selfless service and sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>In John 15:13 it reads “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” Our Savior, Jesus Christ, paid the ultimate sacrifice and willingly laid down his life for us, his friends, so that we could have eternal life and exaltation. To cultivate our treasured relationship requires service and sacrifice. It requires that we lay down, or put aside, our own lives for a while so that we may help and fill the needs of others.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest examples I know of selfless service are Labor Missionaries. Both my father and husband’s father served as labor missionaries from Tonga. These were not 2 or 3 year missions, but 5,6 or 7 year missions. For some even longer.</p>
<p>The Labor Missionary program first began in Tonga in 1950 with the building of Liahona College. Local laborers were called to work under the tutelage and direction of skilled contractors called from the U.S. mainland. &nbsp;They built schools and chapels all over the Tongan islands and many Tongans were able to learn a skilled trade that could bring income. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The building mission in Tonga was completed in 1959. The labor missionary program was very fruitful and was replicated throughout the Pacific. Eventually the program was implemented in many places around the world. The Church College of Hawaii, or CCH, opened for classes in 1955 in a temporary campus next to the Laie chapel near the temple. &nbsp;That same year ground was broken for the permanent campus. The permanent CCH campus was built using the labor missionary program. &nbsp;As in Tonga, local laborers in Hawaii were called to serve under the direction of experienced contractors and tradesmen from the US Mainland.</p>
<p>The CCH campus was finished and dedicated in 1958. Not long after this the growth brought about by the college also brought a need for expansion. This second phase of building would also be completed by building missionaries, only this time laborers would also be called from the islands in the Pacific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of those who had already served one ore more stints as labor missionaries in Tonga were called to Hawaii. Many of the contractors and bosses from the mainland were also called again. Many of these men gave up lucrative careers and comfortable retirements to serve with and train these young men. Indeed they laid down their lives for this work.</p>
<p>In December 1959, word got out that Church Building Commissioner, President Mendenhall was back in Tonga. By then many of the former labor missionaries had secured well paying jobs at the newly formed Tongan Construction Company. &nbsp;Some had just recently been married. And others went home to outer islands to be with their families. Yet when they were called to a special meeting and issued the call to serve, they all accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They arrived in Hawaii in March 1960 along with labor missionaries from Samoa. They worked long, hard days. Rising early and staying late. If you know any of these labor missionaries you know they love each other and loved their time on their mission. &nbsp;It taught them to work hard. It’s where my father-in-law says he got all his muscles. And it taught them to play hard and appreciate each other. To this day they commemorate their arrival in Hawaii every March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They served day in and day out to build dormitories, additions to the temple, the temple visitors center, the temple president’s home and missionary housing near the temple, faculty homes on Moana St., tennis courts and of course, the Polynesian Cultural Center. After two or three years, many of them went on their ways. They got married, some moved to the mainland, some went back home and a few stayed here in Hawaii. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My mom and dad stayed in Hawaii, and in 1964 they decided to build a house in Laie. They leased a lot on Iosepa St. and went about trying to get a loan. They were denied, my dad didn’t have any credit and in those days they did not consider his wife’s earnings in making the loan decision. &nbsp;He was distraught and thought his dreams for building a home were on hold. &nbsp;But then he had an idea. &nbsp;He would build this home Tongan Style, meaning to him, with no money. He asked my mom how much money they had in savings. &nbsp;It was enough to pay for the footing on the house so they began construction. &nbsp;They ordered up the materials and he asked his labor missionary friends to help him. They would continue each week to pay for the materials they could afford and the labor would be free. This group of friends spent all their Saturdays together building this house. It was promised, when this house was done, they would start work on the house for the next guy. They pooled their money and bought machinery and tools they kept in common for use on all the houses. In total they built 6 houses over the course of 10-15 years. With my in-law’s house being the last of the bunch. Each person following suit in paying for the materials but receiving most of the labor free. My parents and the others had the opportunity to own their homes free and clear, because they were willing to lay their lives down each Saturday for their friends!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My Sister Sharon</strong></p>
<p>My older sister, Sharon, laid down her life for me for several years to help watch my young children as my husband finished school and I worked full-time to support our family. This gift of love is so great, it cannot be repaid, but must be paid forward as she has done for us.</p>
<p><strong>The Pink Ladies</strong></p>
<p>I have a group of friends we refer to as the Pink Ladies. We have two sidekicks we call the KKs but they are not in the story today.:) We have been friends for 30+ years. We are family, we once conjured up a family tree from a made-up common ancestor: Captain Cook (well, he’s real, but we just made up the part about him being our ancestor). We learned early on in our friendship family that these were friends and sisters you could call on when you need help; friends who would lay down their lives for a while to lend a helping hand. If you needed something done all you had to do was turn it into a party. Need something sewn? It’s a sewing party. Need wedding favors made? &nbsp;It’s a favor making party. Need your house painted? It’s a painting party. Need walls washed? &nbsp;It’s a wall washing party. Need to raise money? It’s a garage sale party. Need something eaten? Well, we’d mostly go hide and eat it by ourselves, but we always had food at all the other types of parties. Whatever you needed help with? That was our next party. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In time we progressed in our lives, careers, families. Some got married and had children, others moved away to the mainland to pursue opportunities. We went our separate ways but always kept in touch. We are now a bunch of mothers, aunties, teachers, professionals, chefs, aerobic instructors, coaches, seamstresses, crafters, organizers, bakers, entrepreneurs, and singers. &nbsp;You name it, one of these ladies can do it. &nbsp;One of us is not only the mother of her own five children she is also the mother to five football teams; let me rephrase that to add a whole other level of crazy, she is the mother of five red raider tomahawk chopping football teams.</p>
<p>Nothing brings you back together like a friend in need. So what do you do when your own dear sister within the Cook Family is stricken with stage 4 breast cancer with a grim outlook? &nbsp;{show picture of pink party} Well, you have a pink party of course. Lots of them. Pink videos, pink costumes, eating out, driving to doctor appointments, singing, laughing, crying, giving massages, bonding. Our last year with our sister Natasha Vimahi held some of the sweetest, most treasured memories of all. &nbsp;And it came, for a small time, because we laid aside a little bit of our lives to be with our dear friend. There is no greater love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What will you lay down, if even for a moment, to help your friends?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my work in institutional research we regularly survey our BYUH students and recent graduates. We ask what they think about programs, services and our offerings on campus. &nbsp;The response on different items can vary for these groups who are still on campus or just recently finished with their time here. What is interesting to me is that the overwhelming majority of alumni we survey very consistently say that if they had to do it all over again, they would choose BYUH. &nbsp;Their comments show that they LOVE this place. &nbsp;Why is this? I believe it is the people; and how you cherish them and they cherish you. When you look back you will remember the people, your professors, roommates, classmates, co-workers, ward members, and community members. This is a place to treasure up people through small and simple things; and to learn the blessings and joy that come when you lay down your life to help someone else.</p>
<p>How are you preparing yourself to fulfill the prophecy of David O. McKay in becoming genuine gold? &nbsp;How will you fulfill the mission of BYUH to become a person of character and integrity? &nbsp;In answering this please remember, to make the people in your lives count.</p>
<p>I am eternally grateful for the many wonderful people in my life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha!&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Tanner, thank you for the opportunity to speak to the BYU-Hawaii Ohana this morning. &nbsp;In my world, some things are considered beyond reach and until a few weeks ago, standing here as the devotional speaker was one of them. &nbsp;This is made more remarkable and daunting when I consider the possibility that I am standing here speaking to a world-wide audience as this proceeding is being streamed live this morning. I have attended many devotionals as a student and employee for the past 30 years, and never thought that I would ever be the speaker behind the microphone, so fa’afetai tele lava and vinaka vaka levu again for this opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning, I seek the Lord’s help and all of your prayers so that I might in some small way inspire, motivate and reinforce your commitment to your educational success and your desire to be valiant disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Here at BYU-Hawaii, our mantra to Learn, Lead and Build is ultimately a call to assist the Lord in building up Zion wherever we are called to serve. &nbsp;This is our institutional mission that has come to us from inspired leaders under the direction of prophets, seers and revelators. &nbsp;BYU-Hawaii is our training ground before we launch into the world. &nbsp;The world you will enter was described by Elder Anderson of the quorum of the twelve in a speech to Religious educators earlier last year.</p>
<p>“Just as President Monson and other prophets before him have testified, the times prior to the Savior’s return include days of deceit, iniquity, commotion, and confusion.” (Elder Neil Anderson, February 28, 2014)</p>
<p>We see this confusion all around us. Just within the past month, major terror attacks have occurred around the world, and there are ongoing debates about the fates of thousands of refugees from war-torn countries; here in the United States mass shootings have become a regular occurrence. Even within the church, many members are currently caught up in confusion and questioning about updated church policies and the role of women in the church. Despite all of these tumultuous issues, Elder Anderson reassures us that":</p>
<p>“Our days are not unexpected days, and the Lord has provided for our spiritual safety and for the safety of our students. As evil increases in the world, there is a compensatory power of revelation and spiritual gifts given to the righteous. The Lord gives us added power as we are willing to remain righteous in a wicked world.” (Elder Neil Anderson, February 28, 2014)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scripture teaches us that we can gain access to this righteous power to combat the evils of the world if we cultivate faith, hope, and charity. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">D&amp;C 4:5</a>, it reads,“And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.”</p>
<p>In this scripture, Joseph Smith reveals that developing these attributes “qualify” us for the work of building Zion. President Uchtdorf said recently:</p>
<p>“To put it simply, having charity and caring for one another is not simply a good idea. It is not simply one more item in a seemingly infinite list of things we ought to consider doing. It is at the core of the gospel—an indispensable, essential, foundational element. Without this transformational work of caring for our fellowmen, the Church is but a facade of the organization God intends for His people. Without charity and compassion we are a mere shadow of who we are meant to be—both as individuals and as a Church. Without charity and compassion, we are neglecting our heritage and endangering our promise as children of God. No matter the outward appearance of our righteousness, if we look the other way when others are suffering, we cannot be justified.” (President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, Conference with Missionaries in Salt Lake City, Utah, December 4, 2015)</p>
<p>As you may recall during the inauguration of President Tanner several weeks ago, President Eyring gave him the charge to “help the Lord build a Zion community here.” President Eyring then said, “President Tanner knows from observation and long experience how difficult the task before us will be, and how much the Lord needs us to do our part. Time and again, the Lord has asked his people to establish a Zion community. As always, the greatest challenge has been in the hearts of the people.”</p>
<p>President Eyring also said that a Zion university will not necessarily bring equal outcomes for everybody.</p>
<p>“There will not be dead-level equality in all things. But God will help us to love each other so well that we will feel one another’s pains and joys as if they were our own. That would bring the end of selfishness. That miraculous change in hearts will not come easily…. When it comes, even for a moment, you will have had a taste of Zion.” (President Henry B. Eyring, November 10, 2015)</p>
<p>I hope and pray that you will do all you can while you are here to learn, lead and build so that you can effectively utilize your talents and resources to follow President Eyring’s call to build up Zion.</p>
<p>What does it mean to build Zion? In modern revelation Zion is defined as “the pure in heart.” Moses taught that the Lord called his people Zion because“…they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.” &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Moses 7:18</a>)</p>
<p>As we work to become a Zion community, we can earn the Lord’s very special commendation and admonition as recorded in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.34-40?lang=eng#33" target="_blank">Matthew 25:34-40</a>:</p>
<p>“… Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>
<p>“For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>
<p>“Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p>“Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>
<p>“When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p>“Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p>“And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, In-as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These scriptures emphasize the importance of relationships and taking care of each other as an integral part of a Zion community. In order to achieve being of “of one heart and one mind,” we have to have faith in each other and most especially in the Lord. &nbsp;Today, I want to share some stories of individuals who cultivated these attributes of faith, hope, charity, love, and “an eye single to the glory of God” as they helped to build Zion. It is my hope that their stories will give us inspiration about how we can emulate their examples to build Zion right here on campus, in our work, in our studies, in our relationships, and in our callings. The first story that I would like to share is about a person who is special to me. This person is my mother.</p>
<p>My mother’s name is Emma Broederlow Lobendahn. She was born in Savai’i, Western Samoa on August 14, 1921. As a young child, she was sickly and at the age of 13 became gravely ill, bedridden and in pain for months. Despite many visits to the doctors, nothing seemed to be working so my grandmother went to the Branch President and asked him to give my mother a blessing. The branch president sent a message to the members and asked them to fast for my mother the next day. &nbsp;My mother shared this about the blessing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“I remember the branch president laying his hands on my head to give me a blessing. &nbsp;As he prayed he blessed me with many things – the one thing that I remember are these words: &nbsp;‘Emma, you are not going to die yet – the Lord has work for you to do.’” &nbsp;(Grant Underwood, Pioneers of the Pacific)</p>
<p>As a result of the fast and blessing, my mother was completely healed in two weeks. She was never sickly again, and to this day remains physically strong at the age of 94. It is her testimony that she was preserved by the Lord for an important work that she would do later in her life in Fiji.</p>
<p>Before I share that with you, I want to touch on several things about this healing account that are important. First, this story shows the faith of my grandparents, who believed in the power of the priesthood and trusted the authority of the Branch President. Second, it shows the faith and obedience of the Branch members, who all gathered together to fast and pray for one who was seriously ill among them. This is a powerful example of members qualifying to receive blessings through unified service “with one heart and one mind.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing my mother’s story, she moved to Fiji in 1943, where she was married and started a family. Back then, the church had not yet been established in Fiji, and she has shared that she missed attending church meetings. Over ten years later, in 1954, the first LDS missionaries to arrive in Fiji held a meeting to organize the church in Suva, my mother, my two older brothers and myself attended. This is what she has shared about that meeting:</p>
<p>“There were fourteen of us at that meeting. &nbsp;The meeting was wonderful – it felt good to be among members of the church and I was happy. &nbsp;Something dear to my heart was finally happening. &nbsp;I was going to be able to renew my baptismal covenants every Sunday during the blessing and passing of the Sacrament. &nbsp;I was going to have the church in my children’s lives. (Grand Underwood, Pioneers of the Pacific)</p>
<p>The missionaries who organized the meeting and began the work of the church in Fiji were Elder Boyd Harris and Elder Sheldon Abbott. A few weeks after the church was organized, they went to see my mother and asked her to be the Relief Society President. After not attending church services for the previous decade and without much formal education, she felt inadequate to accept the calling. She said,</p>
<p>“I told them that I could not do it – that the responsibility was too much for me. I was afraid that I would make mistakes – the thought of being a Relief Society President scared me.” (Grant Underwood, Pioneers of the Pacific)</p>
<p>Over a period of several days, the Elders came back a second and then a third time to extend the calling to her. I want you to listen carefully to how she responded, despite her fears:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When the Elders came back the third time I knew that I had to do something different. &nbsp;I had to take my fears and worries to the Lord. &nbsp;When they told me that the Lord wanted me to be the Relief Society President – I felt different – a peaceful feeling came over me and my mind went back to a place and time in Samoa when I was a young girl who was very ill and thought that I would die. &nbsp;I fondly remembered the blessing that my Branch President gave me: &nbsp;“Emma you are not going to die, the Lord has work for you to do.” &nbsp;I told Elder Harris and Elder Abbott that I would accept the calling and I wanted to serve to the best of my ability. Once I said “yes” followed by diligence and sacrifices, the Lord blessed me by helping me with good health and strength and above all with His spirit to do my best. (Grant Underwood, Pioneers of the Pacific)</p>
<p>During one of our many sharing times, she proclaimed: “Accepting the call as Relief Society President was one of the best things that I have ever done.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though she felt fear and personally unqualified to take on this calling, her faith qualified her for the work. My mother served as Relief Society President of the Suva Branch of the Fiji Suva Mission from 1954 to 1977, a total of 23 years. As her daughter, I remember many of the things that she did as part of that calling, which she held for my entire childhood, teen, and early adult years.</p>
<p>She fed the labor missionaries who had been brought in from her native Samoa meals regularly while they built the first chapel in Fiji. She organized bazaars for the women in the branch to sell goods and fundraise money to support their families. There were times I remember vividly just the two of us would be present for Relief Society meetings, where she would sing an opening hymn, say an opening prayer, read the lesson aloud to me, sing a closing hymn and say a closing prayer. &nbsp;When I got older, she would often use me as her visiting teaching companion during her travel sometimes requiring several days to fulfill her leadership assignment. &nbsp;All of this was done with four of her own young children to care for.</p>
<p>My purpose in sharing these virtues and accomplishments is to emphasize the extraordinary transformation in my mother from being fearful and lacking confidence in her abilities, to someone who was an effective leader exercising faith, hope and charity with an eye single to the glory of God.</p>
<p>President Monson has taught:</p>
<p>“Now, some of you may be shy by nature, perhaps feeling yourselves inadequate to respond affirmatively to a calling. &nbsp;Remember that this work is not yours and mine alone. &nbsp;It is the Lord’s work and we are entitled to the Lord’s help. &nbsp;Remember that the Lord will shape the back to bear the burden placed upon it.”</p>
<p>Another way that the Lord helped my mother to fulfill her calling was by blessing our family. &nbsp;My father was not a member of the church, and while he tried hard as a husband and father his life-style often clashed with my mother’s values and LDS standards. &nbsp;She would never compromise her standards, but neither did she compromise her responsibilities and obligations as a wife and mother. &nbsp;As a direct blessing of her faithful service, dad ran out of things to criticize and blame her and the church for. &nbsp;My mother was more efficient and received added capabilities, so that she could successfully multi-task at home and church to keep everything in proper balance. &nbsp;This is another lesson learned from my mother that I will never forget.</p>
<p>Other aspects of her character, like persistence and hard work, are compelling testimonies of faith and charity, which I witnessed throughout her life. &nbsp;How many of us here today are like my mother, at times filled with fear or inadequacies? &nbsp;How can we prove our dependability to the Lord so that, like her, we may receive added capability, courage and wisdom to fulfill our church and academic responsibilities, our work and family commitments? &nbsp; How can we be more faithful, charitable, and Christ-centered to qualify for the work?</p>
<p>The next story that I would like to share with you is related to the first, and demonstrates the power of faith and hope when building Zion even when we don’t immediately see the fruits of our labor.</p>
<p>In 2004 my oldest daughter was called to serve in the Utah Provo Mission and she was assigned to the St. George Temple Visitors’ Center. &nbsp; At one point in her mission she remembers pleading with Heavenly Father to help her understand why she got called to the Utah Provo Mission.</p>
<p>One day shortly after she and her companion were knocking on doors in a retirement community in St. George, an elderly gentleman opened the door and invited them in. &nbsp;He introduced himself and my daughter and her companion introduced themselves. &nbsp;He was pleasantly surprised when he found out that my daughter was from Fiji and began speaking to her in Fijian. &nbsp;He told her that he served his mission there many years ago. &nbsp;After a few minutes of conversation, my daughter realized that this was Elder Abbott, the same missionary who with his companion Elder Harris organized the church in Fiji and called my mother, Emma, to be the first Relief Society president in 1954. He quickly went and got his missionary Book of Mormon to show my daughter. &nbsp;He had the names and signatures of the 14 members of the church that attended the first meeting in Fiji. &nbsp;He then told my daughter that while on his mission he never had one convert baptism – and it was hard for him. &nbsp;All these years he felt his “mission” was unsuccessful. &nbsp;My daughter saw the sadness in his eyes.</p>
<p>It was at that precise moment that it became very clear to her that one of the reasons she was sent to the Utah Provo Mission and assigned to the St. George area was for this elderly man who felt that his mission was unsuccessful. My daughter noticed four names on the list in Brother Abbott’s Book of Mormon and she pointed to them and said the following:</p>
<p>“Brother Abbott: This person, Emma Lobendahn is my grandmother. These two people – Brian and Elliott Lobendahn are my uncles. This person, Irene Lobendahn is my mother. I am her eldest child.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She told him that he was the missionary who gave her mother (me) a baby’s blessing; that he was the missionary who extended the call to her grandmother, and gave her a special blessing to help her fulfill her calling as the Relief Society President; and that she served faithfully in that calling for 23 years, long after he returned home from his mission.</p>
<p>My daughter told him how her father, my husband Brother Meli Lesuma, joined the church in 1973. &nbsp;He served a mission in 1977, and converted his whole family. &nbsp;His three younger brothers and now his four children have all served missions. She told him that Fiji now has a temple, four stakes, one district and many wards and branches. &nbsp;She told him that the church membership in Fiji is over 12,000. &nbsp;She then said,</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Brother Abbott, because of you and your work as the first missionary in Fiji, you accomplished many great things and I and my family will always be grateful to you. &nbsp;Your work has brought thousands of people into the church in Fiji.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my daughter finished sharing these details, Brother Abbott was in tears. He was grateful for my daughter’s timely visit, and no longer felt that his mission was unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first reaction when I heard this story was to reflect on what a loving Heavenly Father we have, who knew to send help and reassurance to this man. I spoke with Brother Abbott on the phone, he said that when he called my mother to be the Relief Society President, he knew that she was the one the Lord wanted to help build Zion in Fiji, and that all she needed to do was to get rid of her fears.</p>
<p>A lot of us have fear. During the days of Christ’s ministry here on earth, his disciples witnessed His majestic power and mighty miracles. He healed so that the blind could see and the lame could walk. They witnessed Jesus feeding five thousand people with five fish and two loaves of bread. Why then, after seeing these miracles, did they fear? I think we can ask ourselves the very same question. I am confident that many of us in this building have felt of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s love for us and have even witnessed their tender mercies, our very own miracles. Yet, when the winds come and we are tossed at sea, our faith is blown to and fro and, like the disciples, we let our fear overcome us. My mother felt that fear and declined the Lord’s call two times before she finally accepted. Brother Abbott feared for decades after returning home from his mission that he was “unsuccessful”.</p>
<p>I would like to share one last story with you today that illustrates the importance of cultivating faith and charity as we strive to become a Zion community. This is the story of Rebekah, which is found in the book of Genesis in the Old Testament. In a Conference broadcast, Bonnie Parkin described Rebekah as, “[a woman] whose daily efforts reflected charity. With [her heart] filled with the pure love of Christ, [she] responded to needs quickly and effectively.”</p>
<p>As we all know, Rebekah eventually became the wife of Isaac and the mother of Jacob and Esau, blessed in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/24.60?lang=eng#59" target="_blank">Genesis chapter 24 verse 60 </a>to become, quote, “the mother of thousands of millions.”</p>
<p>Rebekah qualified herself to fill this important role in building Zion through faith and charity long before she knew her calling and role in the church. In Genesis chapter 24 we read that Abraham gave his servant several general directives in order to find his son, Isaac, a wife. First, he was not to choose a Canaanite from the land where they lived, but should travel to find a woman from among the Lord’s covenant people. He also asked his servant to convince the woman to leave her home and travel to Canaan to marry Isaac without meeting him first. What Abraham did not do is give his servant any specific details. I’m sure that this servant wondered how he would find the right woman to fill the sacred role of Isaac’s wife, let alone convince her to leave her family and homeland with a complete stranger!&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Abraham’s servant had faith in his calling, which qualified him to find Rebekah and bring her back. Upon arriving at the city of Nahor, his very first act was to say a prayer of faith:</p>
<p>“And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</p>
<p>Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:</p>
<p>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/24.12-15?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Genesis 24:12-15</a>)</p>
<p>This account of the faith and devotion of Abraham’s servant is a wonderful example of how the Lord listens to and answers our righteous desires. With no way to know how he was supposed to find the important woman chosen to be Isaac’s wife, he turned to the Lord to guide him. Notice how quickly the Lord answered the servant’s prayer, and how quickly the man acted in faith, once he saw Rebekah:</p>
<p>“And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.</p>
<p>And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</p>
<p>And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</p>
<p>And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels." <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/24.17-20?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">(Genesis 24:17-20)</a></p>
<p>The servant had ten camels with him. I imagine that it took Rebekah many trips to and from the well before she had drawn enough water to satisfy them all. I’d like to draw your attention to Rebekah’s actions in this account. First, she was willing to give water to a stranger. I’d like to think that most of us would be willing to do the same, and help someone that asks us for a small favor. However, her offer to also take on the hot, dusty, and time-consuming job of watering the camels reveals why the Lord chose her to fill such an important position in Zion. She did not know that this man was the servant of her uncle Abraham, that he was looking for her, or had prayed to find her. All she saw was a person in need, and “hasted” to fill that need.</p>
<p>Sister Parkin said of this act,“Rebekah loved with worthiness and willingness as a daughter of God. From her we learn that charity, though often quantified as the action, is actually the state of the heart that prompts us to love one another. She offered water. It was in the offering that charity was manifest.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebekah’s example teaches us that in order to increase in charity, we must cultivate a state of heart that prompts us to love and serve one another.</p>
<p>The Guide to the Scriptures defines charity as “the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love”. It is the pure love of Jesus Christ. As we learn of Jesus Christ and strive to become like Him, we will begin to feel His pure love in our lives and be prompted to love and serve others as He would. The world often defines charity as giving to the poor or needy in order to meet their physical needs. It is certainly that, but the description of Zion as a community with “no poor among them” also applies to the poor and needy in spirit. President Thomas S. Monson has defined what it means to charitably fill spiritual needs. He said, “Charity is having patience with someone who has let us down. It is resisting the impulse to become offended easily. It is accepting weaknesses and shortcomings. It is accepting people as they truly are. It is looking beyond physical appearances to attributes that will not dim through time. It is resisting the impulse to categorize others.”</p>
<p>Take a minute to think about the people you interact with every day. Your roommate, your friends, coworkers, professors and classmates, your family. Can you be more patient with them? &nbsp;More accepting, loving, and forgiving? How will you treat them differently so that you can join them in “one heart and one mind” to build Zion together? Who can you reach out to, that might be struggling in spirit? Is there someone that you need to forgive, or ask for their forgiveness?</p>
<p>These are not always easy questions to act upon. Some are as simple as offering the seat next to you during Sunday School or at the cafeteria. Others, like forgiveness, can be much more difficult to accomplish. However, the Lord has asked us to do them so that we can become a Zion people.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, as we strive to create a Zion community here on campus, remember that “faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify [us] for the work.” I hope that the stories I have shared with you today about my mother, Brother Abbott, and Rebekah have inspired you to reflect upon your daily acts, motivated you to do better, and reinforced the importance of cultivating these key attributes. It is my prayer that each of us will learn to rely on the Lord to help us with our problems, and that we will also have open eyes and willing hands to be the answer to others’ prayers of faith. With our hearts knit together in righteousness, charity, and love, we can exercise our faith and hope to build the Lord’s kingdom here at BYU-Hawaii and wherever .</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>December 1, 2015<br />Steve Hoag<br />Vice President of Administration, Hawaii Reserves, Inc.<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, Mele Kalikimaka and Aloha! Thank you, Heather, for your enduring love and support - she is my "better half" and I am indeed both a happy philosopher and a happy husband!</p>
<p>Whether we are currently facing monumental struggles, or the more common challenges of life, I hope that my remarks today will kindle renewed inspiration to not just endure, but <em>rise</em> through our trials.</p>
<p>Speaking about adverse circumstances and our perspective, Elder Paul H. Dunn of the Seventy noted that “there are those who seem to have the knack of seeing the positive side. A young businessman was opening a new branch office, and a friend sent a floral arrangement to help celebrate the occasion. When the friend arrived at the opening, he was appalled to find the wreath bore the inscription 'Rest in Peace'. Angry, he later complained to the florist. After apologizing, the florist said, 'Look at it this way. Somewhere today a man was buried under a wreath that said, Good luck in your new location’ ” (Ensign, May 1987).</p>
<p><strong><em>We have been sent here to be tested</em></strong></p>
<p>Indeed, how we look at things ‒ our perspective ‒ can entirely change our attitudes and therefore our actual experience. Through scripture we gain divine perspective about why we have been <em>put here</em> in mortality. In the pre-existence the Lord said: “[W]e will make an earth whereon these [souls] may dwell; And we will prove [or test] them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.24-25?lang=eng#23" target="_blank">(Abraham 3:24-25)</a>. We have been put here to be tried and tested; therefore, testing and challenge are a natural part of our existence.</p>
<p>My mission president understood the principle that trials and challenges can be good for us. Shortly after I had been given the responsibility for directing the work of several missionaries, I received a phone call from a district leader reporting that two missionaries in his district had a heated argument that nearly ended in a fight. My companion and I went to the missionaries’ home to try to restore peace and resolve concerns.</p>
<p>We sat down with the two missionaries and started our meeting with a prayer. In the middle of the prayer we were interrupted by the knocking of another missionary living in the same home who reported to us that his companion, fully dressed in his missionary attire, was unresponsive, lying down, and appeared to be in some kind of a coma. After trying for some time to get this missionary to respond by shaking him, yelling, splashing water on him, and so forth, we finally called for an ambulance. EMTs arrived, revived him, and took him to the hospital.</p>
<p>As soon as the ambulance left, the first thing I did was to call my mission president on the phone. I related to him what had occurred with the fighting elders, as well as the elder in the coma. Feeling overwhelmed by these circumstances and in way over my head, I asked him, “President, what should I do?” I’ll never forget his wise response that became one of the greatest lessons of my life. Although funny now, it was a bit of shock to me at the time. “President, what should I do?” His reply, “I don’t know Elder Hoag. What should you do? You’re the senior zone leader – you pray about it, figure it out, and then call me back. That’s why I put you there.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>That's why he put me there.</em></p>
<p>Although I wanted him to, my mission president didn’t take the trial away from me, knowing that, like muscles, our mental and spiritual capacities grow and are strengthened by challenge.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball taught, “Strength and struggle go together. The supreme reward of struggle is strength. Life is a battle and the greatest joy is to overcome. The pursuit of easy things makes men weak…. It is following the lines of least resistance that makes rivers and men crooked” (Kimball, <em>The Miracle of Forgiveness</em>, p. 164). Usually it is not in spite of, but rather because of, our trials that we progress.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trials and opposition are all around us</em></strong></p>
<p>Whether we realize it or not, trials and opposition are with us all the time; they are part of the everyday reality of living in this world. A few examples of some of the common opposition we face daily in the physical realm:</p>
<p><strong><em>Trials and opposition exist for our good</em></strong></p>
<p>Indeed, we learn from the prophet Lehi that opposition exists for our good. Regarding opposition in the spiritual realm, he taught his son Jacob, "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so...righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:11</a>).</p>
<p>Adam and Eve were the first of us <em>put here</em> to eventually experience opposition and trial. Lehi further explained that opposing choices are what allows mankind to "act for himself", and that "men&nbsp;are, that they might have&nbsp;joy" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.16,%2025-27?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:16, 25</a>).</p>
<p>We might understand this intellectually, however, some “trials and hardships we encounter in life are severe and appear to have lasting consequences” (Quentin L. Cook, Ensign, November 2008). They can be tough emotionally, and could be illustrated by some of the following questions and statements:</p>
<p>(Taken and adapted from Gene R. Cook, “The Love of God”, February 2005 BYU Devotional.)</p>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to know the specific answers to these kinds of questions. Trials can sometimes seem unfair and unjust, shake the faith of some, and cause some to doubt God’s love for us or even His existence (see Pres. Henry B. Eyring, Ensign, May 2009). Some philosophers have labeled this concern "the problem of evil" and argued that human suffering demonstrates that either God does not exist; or if He does, He is not powerful enough to prevent evil from occurring in the lives of good people, or He simply does not care.</p>
<p>Indeed, in times of trial or suffering we may ask, to echo my mission experience, <em>Can this really be why I was put here?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Two family experiences</em></strong></p>
<p>Let me share two family experiences involving trials. The first experience happened to my parents, two years before I was born.</p>
<p>In February of 1964 a vehicle ran head-on into my parents' car shortly after they emerged from the Kaneohe exit of the Wilson tunnel. Back then there was no concrete barrier dividing the oncoming lanes, as there is now. As a result, my mother suffered numerous serious injuries, including multiple face, jaw and head fractures, a ruptured spleen, a totally shattered pelvis, a fractured right hip, and multiple fractures in both ankles and feet. At the time my father was a Catholic and my mother a semi-active Latter-day Saint, so when the doctors said twice in the first week that she would soon die, twice she received the Catholic "last rites" to prepare her for death. And twice afterwards my mother's family called Melchizedek Priesthood holders to give her blessings of healing, miraculously restoring her life.</p>
<p>During this experience my grandmother promised my mother that, 'the Lord will be by your side to carry you through this horrific ordeal', and that 'one day you will look upon this sad experience as a blessing in disguise.' And indeed it was. The experience dramatically changed perspectives, especially my father's.</p>
<p>A confident naval aviator and Marine Corps helicopter pilot, my father had previously paid little attention to the LDS missionaries; he now saw firsthand that the power of the priesthood was real. He re-took the missionary discussions with a new outlook and was later baptized. And to the amazement of everyone, my mother lived, walked again, and had children when I was born two years later and my sisters thereafter. We were later sealed as a family here, in the Laie Hawaii Temple, in 1968 - just four years after the car accident.</p>
<p>Of this experience my mother later wrote joyfully, "we testify that miracles occur, in the due time of the Lord. We have witnessed His hand after the trial of faith many times in our lives!"</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord allows and uses traumatic, physical experiences like these to literally re-arrange and elevate our lives for good. More often the rearranging is less extreme, but still effective. Christian writer, C.S. Lewis, observed:</p>
<p>“Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of - throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself” (Lewis, Mere Christianity).</p>
<p>The second experience I'll share is much less dramatic than the first, but one that most of you will appreciate as college students, faculty and staff. In my second year of law school, over 20 years ago, I took a class in "Family Law"; the study of the statutes and case law that deal with marriage, divorce, adoption, etc. Most law school classes have no homework you turn in, attendance doesn't count, and there are no quizzes. Your whole grade typically depends on just one, three-hour, final examination.</p>
<p>The semester came and went, and the day of the Family Law final exam arrived. The three-hour test began and, for whatever reason, I was not "focused" that day. As I recall, I slowly read the first of three essay questions and jotted down some notes. Then I went to the restroom. I returned to my seat and considered how long I still had - well over two hours - a lot of time. I thought about what I would do after the test at home. I slowly finished the first answer, then went to the restroom again, then slowly read the second essay question. Do you see a pattern emerging here?</p>
<p>Fast forward to 40 minutes left in the three-hour period and I began to realize that I had little time to finish my second answer and get to the final essay question. Mild panic started to set in, and I began to write furiously. As the 30 minute to time up mark came, I realized that I had written myself into a corner on the second essay answer and had come to the wrong conclusions. But because I had squandered my time, there was nothing I could really do to fix it.</p>
<p>With 20 minutes left, I began writing my answer to the last question but could hardly concentrate as full panic had now set in. At this point, only half my brain was functioning on the exam because the other half was too occupied worrying - as well as scolding me for my uncharacteristic carelessness and inexplicable stupidity. People began turning in their tests. As I was maybe half way through answering the third question, time up was called. What just happened? I asked myself in disbelief.</p>
<p>As I left the room and walked out into the cool December air I knew that I had bombed the test; I couldn't even cling to the hope of some miracle "C-". I felt worse than I ever had before in my life about any test. Unlike my early college years, my academic performance was no longer just about my GPA (grade point average). I thought about my wife and children who were now depending on me to do well, so I could find a good job and provide for them. I was distraught.</p>
<p>As I waited for my wife to pick me up outside the law school, I began praying fervently for guidance. I felt my despair lighten as the very slightest glimmer of hope entered my heart. I vowed that I would never make the same mistakes again.</p>
<p>I began to analyze what I had done wrong leading up to the exam, and especially during the final; how I had ignored established study methods, test taking strategies, time management, advice on the need to outline essay answers before beginning to write, and so forth. You could say that I began the process of "academic repentance" over the next several days.</p>
<p>I pondered deeply the words of the Lord to Moroni in the book of Ether. As you'll recall, Moroni felt inadequate about his writing ability - what Moroni called his "weakness"; in response to his concerns the Lord taught: "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I&nbsp;give&nbsp;unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my&nbsp;grace&nbsp;is sufficient for all men that&nbsp;humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make&nbsp;weak things become strong unto them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">Ether 12:27</a>).</p>
<p>I firmly believed that, with the Lord's help and grace, this weakness would be made a strength; because of this trial I would not make the same mistakes again, and I would be stronger for it.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I learned that I indeed had received a "D" on the exam. I was not surprised. It of course hurt my GPA some, but my test taking in the remaining time in law school was much better as a result. I later graduated from law school, landed a great job at a Honolulu law firm, and began the three-month preparation period for the dreaded Bar Exam.</p>
<p>This was the two and a half day test that determines whether you are allowed to practice law as a licensed attorney; i.e., whether you can work as a lawyer. Considering that law school graduates who have been studying for months using professional test preparation courses often fail the pass/fail Bar Exam, it is a source of fear and anxiety for everyone. Many people have had to take it multiple times in order to finally pass, including John F. Kennedy, Jr., Hillary Clinton, future U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Benjamin Cardozo (he had to take it six times).</p>
<p>In the months preceding the exam, like my fellow graduates, I devoted just about every day to study and practice test taking. On the inside of my Bar Exam binder that contained all of my notes and outlines for the many subjects to be tested over the three-day exam period, I had written the words found in Ether 12:27. I began each day's study by praying and pondering over this scripture. As the time for the exam approached and anxiety started to build, I also sought a blessing of comfort and counsel from my father, and felt at peace.</p>
<p>The days of the Bar Exam arrived, I took the tests over a trying three days and felt good. All of the test strategies that I had learned through prep classes and my own experiences, including my Family Law test, culminated in that one exam. After the test was over, I told my wife that I didn't want to ever take another test again in my life!</p>
<p>Several weeks passed by and I received a letter in the mail from the Bar Examiners office. With my wife standing near me at home, I opened the letter, and as I read the very first word, "Congratulations," I involuntarily fell to my knees out of relief. Heather and I shed tears of joy and gratitude that I had passed the exam, and we knelt down at that moment to offer a prayer of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Our two oldest daughters, then only 5 and 3, came into the living room and wondered why Mom and Dad were on their knees crying. They were confused as we told them we were crying because we were so happy! That made absolutely no sense to them. (By the way, a classmate of mine who also passed the exam made the mistake of opening his congratulatory letter at the post office, where he also fell to his knees and began crying and shouting, right there in public.)</p>
<p>There in our home, in that moment of joy, we thanked the Lord for his grace that undoubtedly strengthened and lifted me beyond my natural capacities. I later learned that more than a fourth of the test takers failed the Bar Exam, and that I did &nbsp;much better than I had hoped. Through faith in the Lord and His abundant grace, my earlier weakness and trial had indeed become a blessing to me and my family.</p>
<p>Pres. Henry B. Eyring has taught: “The very opportunity for us to face adversity and affliction is part of the evidence of [the Lord’s] infinite love. God gave us the gift of living in mortality so that we could be prepared to receive the greatest of all the gifts of God, which is eternal life....And I know from my own experience that He can and will give us strength to rise through every trial" (Ensign, May 2009).</p>
<p>This is why we were put here in mortality.</p>
<p><strong><em>How we can rise through our trials</em></strong></p>
<p>The scriptures are full of examples of those who rose through their trials, using&nbsp; them as stepping stones to greater heights:</p>
<p>We can learn much from Nephi about overcoming trials, who with faith focused on the path, not the obstacles. As a result of his persistent faith, he was led by the Spirit and delivered – not from his trial, but through it (see Henry Eyring, <em>To Draw Closer To God</em>, p. 86).</p>
<p>Nephi’s experience illustrates how faith and good cheer are closely related. Satan understands this relationship and thus tries to erode our faith by discouraging us. Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Twelve taught, “Whisperings of ‘you can’t do it,’ ‘you’re no good,’ ‘it’s too late,’ ‘what’s the use?’ or ‘things are hopeless’ are tools of destruction. Satan … wants you to quit trying. It is important that discouragement is cast out of [our lives]” (Ensign, May 1988).</p>
<p>In contrast, the Holy Spirit not only comforts us, he fills us with good cheer, courage, hope and confidence – especially in times of trial and tribulation. He can be not only our Comforter, but also our greatest Cheerleader. And our Savior, Jesus Christ, reminds us: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/16.33?lang=eng#32" target="_blank">John 16:33</a>).</p>
<p>We can heed the Lord’s oft-repeated command to “be of good cheer” by choosing to fill our lives with activities and entertainment that are uplifting. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Periscope, and the like can be forums where we seek out and share goodness, including gospel messages. But if we are not careful, the sometimes negative and lewd content in such media can quickly erode our spirituality and virtue. We can suffer unnecessary trials of our own making if we allow darkness and sin into our lives, and thereby prevent the Lord from aiding us as He would like. We will be blessed with good cheer when we repent as needed, consistently filter out evil, and fill our lives with light and virtue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Jesus Christ rose through the trial of the atonement</em></strong></p>
<p>As in all things, on the subject of overcoming and rising through our trials, Jesus Christ is our great Exemplar. He can help us with our hardships, for in the darkest hours when He atoned for our sins, even He felt overwhelmed and alone. In the face of ultimate adversity, even He wished for some possible way that He could be spared ‒ perhaps as Isaac was rescued at the last minute.</p>
<p>We read in Matthew: "Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and... began&nbsp;to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith he unto them, My soul is&nbsp;exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and&nbsp;watch&nbsp;with me.&nbsp;And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my&nbsp;Father, if it be possible, let this&nbsp;cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I&nbsp;will, but as&nbsp;thou&nbsp;wilt" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/26.36-39?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">Matt. 26:36-39</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike Isaac, there was no ram in the thicket for Our Savior; He obeyed and drank of the cup of the unimaginable trials of Gethsemane and the cross. Jesus overcame and rose through His suffering, death, and resurrection. Descending triumphant through the air as a resurrected and perfected being, He announced Himself to the Nephites saying, "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.10-11?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">3 Nephi 11:10-11</a>).</p>
<p><strong><em>We can trust the Lord and rise</em></strong></p>
<p>I am still a relatively young man who has not experienced severe trials, so how can I be sure of the Lord's counsel to Joseph Smith, and to all of us, when He said: "know thou, my son, that <em>all</em> these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">D&amp;C 122:7</a>)?</p>
<p>I believe this because I know that the Lord lives, that repentance and the atonement are real, and that He loves us as we cannot understand. Perhaps like Nephi, I might say, “I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">1 Nephi 11:17</a>).</p>
<p>I recognize that not all trials have a happy ending, especially as viewed from our mortal perspective and limited timeline. But I trust that if we choose to obey God, all things will be made right in the eternal scheme and time of He who beholds the past, present and future as 'one eternal now'. I know that through the Lord's grace and mercy, our weaknesses can become strengths, and our suffering turned into joy.</p>
<p>From C.S. Lewis: "[The Lord] said (in the Bible) that we were ‘gods’ and He is going to make good His words. If we let Him—for we can prevent Him, if we choose—He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess, a dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly (though, of course, on a smaller scale) His own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts very painful, but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. He meant what He said" (Lewis, <em>Mere Christianity</em>).</p>
<p>God in His great power could have delivered the brass plates to Nephi in a trial-free way, but He didn’t. As He has done with Adam and Eve, the prophets, and even His own Son, God put us here to experience challenge and trials as an opportunity for us to grow, and exercise faith, for ‘He loves us more than our being perfectly happy day by day’ (see Gene R. Cook, cited above).</p>
<p>We can do hard things with God’s help, and experience joy, even if we can’t see how at first. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Through Him we are capable of many great things if we have faith, obey, repent as needed, maintain an eternal perspective, make the effort to do good, and persist.</p>
<p>In the words of Pres. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "We acknowledge that your path will at times be difficult....Stand tall and walk in the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ! You are stronger than you realize. You are more capable than you can imagine. You can do it now!" (Ensign, November 2013)</p>
<p>May we go forward with good cheer, having faith in Christ, that we may rise through our trials. This, indeed, is why we were put here.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>November 17, 2015<br />James E. Faulconer<br />Professor of Philosophy, BYU<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Today I want to read the parables of Luke 15 with you, the parables we call “The Parable of the Lost Sheep,” “The Parable of the Lost Coin,” and “The Parable of the Prodigal Son.” I hope that by reading these scriptures together, you will learn something, perhaps not something new but I hope you’ll come to a deeper understanding. If nothing else, I hope you will be reminded that the scriptures are replete with spiritual wisdom and their study is one of the surest ways to bring the Spirit into your life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the interpretive key I will use for thinking about these parables from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland. Speaking of the parable of the laborers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-15), he said: “This parable—like all parables—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and&nbsp;forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.”<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I suggest that as we read these three parables we understand them, too, as reminders of the Atonement and the blessings and responsibilities that it brings.</p>
<p>So begin with Luke 15:1. It says:</p>
<p>Then drew near unto him all the&nbsp;publicans&nbsp;and sinners for to hear him.</p>
<p>We have seen this before. Something very much like this happens at the beginning of the previous chapter. In fact, this is at least the third time that Luke has portrayed a similar scene: people gathering for a feast,<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> with sinners gathering around Jesus, and Pharisees and scribes complaining about that as they do in verse 2, which says:</p>
<p>And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p>
<p>What they are complaining about is that Jesus talks and eats with despised people: those who collect taxes and who are sinners. When we hear the word <em>sinners </em>we think of those who commit assault, theft, adultery, and so on. Of course those would also have been sins in Jesus’ day. But being a sinner in the first century meant more than it does today. A sinner was any unclean person, and being unclean meant more than not living a moral life. A person could be unclean merely on the basis of his occupation. With no disrespect meant to your new president, tanners, for example, were unclean. People with certain diseases or disfigurements were unclean. So when the Pharisees and scribes say that Jesus eats with sinners, they were referring to a range of people from thieves and murderers, at one end of the spectrum, to those in unclean professions, at the other. Jesus not only speaks with this large group of people, as we see Him doing in verse 1, he eats with them, which would make Him, too, unclean. Thus, Luke 15 begins with a familiar New Testament setting: Jesus is being criticized—behind His back—for the fact that He has dealings with those whom the scribes and Pharisees believe ought to be avoided.</p>
<p>We probably most often think that these parables are about the need for us to perform the rescue, as President Thomas S. Monson has called it. They are, indeed, about that need and a prophetic voice has reminded us.<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But they are also about more than rescue, and the first verse of the chapter suggests that we should try to understand the parables as a response to the setting we see there.</p>
<p>In that setting, whether a feast or a meeting on the road, Jesus meets with despised people and is criticized for doing so.<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The parables of the chapter are a response to that criticism. Of course, as He has often done, Jesus answers with a parable a criticism they have made only in whispers:</p>
<p>What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine&nbsp;in&nbsp;the wilderness, and go after that which is&nbsp;lost, until he find it? And when he hath found&nbsp;it<em>,</em>&nbsp;he layeth&nbsp;it&nbsp;on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together&nbsp;his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.4-6?lang=eng#3" target="_blank">Luke 15: 4-6</a>)</p>
<p>For obvious reasons we call this “The Parable of the Lost Sheep.” All of us have seen artistic depictions of it, but for a few moments I want you to suspend your recollection of any depictions of this parable that you might be familiar with, and turn your attention to the story itself.</p>
<p>Notice that there are no lambs in the story, only sheep.<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Now think about how the shepherd gets the lost sheep back to the flock: he puts it on his shoulders. I assume that he carried it because the sheep was exhausted or wounded and could not return on its own, but why not in His arms? The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas tells us that the lost sheep was the biggest one,<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> but regardless of its relative size in the herd, it would not be small if it is not a lamb. Google tells me that the average ewe weighs between 100 and 220 pounds while the average ram weighs between 100 and 350 pounds. Even at the light end, the shepherd must carry at least one hundred pounds for what I presume was some distance. He could only do that by putting the sheep across his shoulders, and carrying such a load would be taxing. But weight wouldn’t be the only problem. Anyone who has seen a herd of sheep, whether in the dusty Utah and Arizona desert or the green hills of Ireland and Britain, knows that they are dirty, smelly animals. This is the story of someone doing a great deal of hard, smelly work for one sheep out of a hundred. Yet, Jesus tells us in verse 5, He does it joyfully:</p>
<p>[W]hen he hath found&nbsp;it<em>,</em>&nbsp;he layeth&nbsp;it&nbsp;on his shoulders, rejoicing. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.5?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Luke 15:5</a>)</p>
<p>The shepherd rejoices <em>in</em> the work before he gets home to his friends and neighbors, where he says:</p>
<p>Rejoice&nbsp;with me;&nbsp;for&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;found&nbsp;my&nbsp;sheep&nbsp;which&nbsp;was&nbsp;lost. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Luke 15:6</a>)</p>
<p>The shepherd’s joy begins as soon as he finds the lost sheep and it continues through the work of return.</p>
<p>At the end of the parable, in case the Pharisees and scribes didn’t understand it, Jesus tells them its moral. Verse 7 says:</p>
<p>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repented, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Luke 15:7</a>)</p>
<p>The parable has at least three meanings: First, we must understand that heaven itself rejoices over human repentance. The recovery of those who are exhausted, wounded, and unable to return on their own because of sin—in other words, every human being—is the work of the Atonement. Thus, second, Jesus’ critics ought to rejoice for the return of those who seek Him out, just as the shepherd rejoiced for his sheep. And third, we must imitate the Savior by rescuing those who are lost and taking joy in that work.</p>
<p>What made the lost sheep different than the others? Was it loved more? There’s no reason to believe so. Was it more valuable? The parable says nothing about that. What made it different than the ninety and nine was only that it was lost. What about those whom the shepherd left behind to await his return? Are they really comparable to “just persons, which need no repentance,” but over whom there implicitly seems to be no great joy? Surely we must read that phrase about not needing repentance with a bit of a smile. If we ask who the ninety and nine supposedly just persons are, we have to recognize there are none—except Christ, the only just person. All the rest of humanity are sheep who have gone astray and need rescue. There is only one rescuer, Jesus Christ, whom we see here administering to lost sheep by eating and talking with them—and by offering parables to bring them to repentance.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">After hearing this parable, the Pharisees and scribes, whose sneer about Jesus eating with publicans and sinners initiated it, remain silent. I imagine Jesus telling this story and then pausing, waiting for them to respond.<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn7">[7]</a> He hopes that perhaps there is at least one among them who recognizes how the parable speaks to them. But nothing happens; no one says anything.</span></p>
<p>Is their silence a sign of guilt or incomprehension? Either is imaginable. But when they say nothing, I also imagine Jesus, as it were, trying a second time. If that didn’t get His point across, perhaps the next parable will. He tells what we call “The Parable of the Lost Coin”:</p>
<p>Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one&nbsp;piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find&nbsp;it? And when she hath found&nbsp;it she calleth&nbsp;her&nbsp;friends and her&nbsp;neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the&nbsp;angels&nbsp;of God over one&nbsp;sinner&nbsp;that repenteth. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.8-10?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Luke 15:8-10)</a></p>
<p>This has the same narrative structure as the first parable: loss, search, recovery, and joy. It has the same moral comparing her joy with the joy in heaven over those who repent. But it is shorter, getting to the point immediately. By doing so, perhaps it will get the critics’ attention.</p>
<p>Once again, however, the Pharisees and scribes seem to remain silent. I imagine Jesus pausing again, perhaps somewhat longer, waiting for someone to say something. Then, realizing that neither parable appears to have taught what He wanted them to learn, He tells a third.</p>
<p>We often call this one “The Parable of the Prodigal Son,” but doing so imposes an interpretation on it that isn’t true to the story as a whole. We find that title first of all in the notes printed in the margins of English Bibles in the sixteenth century,<a href="file:///C:/Users/URC/Desktop/Winter%202016%20Devotionals/Faulconer/Luke%2015%20The%20Parables%20of%20Loss%20and%20Redemption.docx#_edn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and it seems that we have adopted it from there. If we look for an alternative, thinking about the parallel of this story with the first two parables of this sequence might tempt us to give it a title like theirs, “The Parable of the Lost Son:” a son is lost and then found, and his father rejoices. The two earlier parables are important background for understanding the point of this final one. This, too, is a story about loss, rescue, and joy. But if we read the story only that way we forget that almost half of the parable is about the lost son’s older brother, something Jesus tells us at the beginning, when in verse 13 he says:</p>
<p>A certain man had two sons. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank">Luke 15:11</a>)</p>
<p>This is about three people, not just two. So, for now, let’s call this “The Parable of a Father and His Two Sons.”</p>
<p>The parable begins with the younger son’s test of his father’s love:</p>
<p>[T]he younger of them said to&nbsp;his&nbsp;father, Father, give me the portion of&nbsp;goods&nbsp;that falleth&nbsp;to me<em>.</em>&nbsp;And he divided unto them&nbsp;his&nbsp;living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted&nbsp;his&nbsp;substance&nbsp;with&nbsp;riotous&nbsp;living. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.12-13?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Luke 15:12-13</a>)</p>
<p>Using legalistic language, the younger son asks for his share of his father’s property. It is important for us to remember that the only property this father appears to have is that of his farm. He has land, and goats and sheep. It is also important to think about how the younger son would be able to gather together his share of that property so that he could go on his journey: he would have to sell it. The son is asking his father to break up the family farm so he can sell his share for the cash he needs to finance his new life. Whatever percentage amounted to the younger son’s share, any amount significant enough to count would also be a significant loss to the family livelihood. It looks to me like the younger son is asking his father to reduce the standard of living for the family so that he can live as he wants. But there is no suggestion of recrimination or hesitation on the father’s part. The son makes his demand, and we read in verse 12:</p>
<p>He divided unto them his living. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Luke 15:12</a>)</p>
<p>The father divides his property between the two sons, though for now we hear only about the younger one. An ungrateful son rejects his father and his family, hurting the family economically and embarrassing them publicly, but the father is neither angry nor punitive.</p>
<p>For his part the son acts as we so often act when we think we have found a way to live as we wish, unencumbered by relationships and the obligations of those relationships. He leaves and wastes what he has been given. But this young man does not understand that he is lost, at least not at first. He cannot see it when he asks his father for his share. He cannot see it when he lives extravagantly in a foreign and probably sophisticated place. He cannot even see it when he has run out of money. Verses 14 through 16 tell us what he goes through before he comes to realize what it means that he has cut himself off from his father and family:</p>
<p>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he&nbsp;would fain&nbsp;have filled his belly with the&nbsp;husks [carob pods] that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</p>
<p>Only when he has been reduced to abject poverty, to the humiliation of being a swineherd, and to painful hunger does he understand his loss.</p>
<p>Eloquently, verse 17 describes that moment of understanding as him coming to himself:</p>
<p>And when he&nbsp;came&nbsp;to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Luke 15:17</a>)</p>
<p>Recognizing that he has lost his place in the family and now doesn’t even have what his father’s hired hands have, namely daily bread, the young man makes a plan, described in verses 18-20:</p>
<p>I will&nbsp;arise&nbsp;and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have&nbsp;sinned&nbsp;against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father.&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.18-20?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Luke 15:18-20</a>)</p>
<p>Rather than joining himself to a citizen of a far country, he will join himself to his father. So he goes.</p>
<p>In verse 20 we see how he was received:</p>
<p>[W]hen he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.20?lang=eng#19" target="_blank">Luke 15:20</a>)</p>
<p>To my mind this is one of the great scenes in all literature. The father has been waiting. We don’t know how long. We also don’t know how he sees the son when he is still a long way off, but he does. And the moment he sees his son he has compassion. As some of us in academia say, the father always already had compassion. He runs to his son, embraces him, and kisses him. The father does not ask what has happened or what the son did with his money. With his return the past no longer matters. The only thing that matters is that the son has come back.</p>
<p>The young man then begins to do exactly what he said he was going to do. He begins the speech that he had rehearsed in verses 18-19, saying:</p>
<p>Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more&nbsp;worthy to be called thy&nbsp;son. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Luke 15:21</a>)</p>
<p>He gets as far as confessing that he has given up the right to be called “son,” but before he can finish, his father interrupts by turning to the servants and ordering the feast of celebration described in verses 22-24:</p>
<p>[T]he father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put&nbsp;it&nbsp;on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on&nbsp;his&nbsp;feet: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill&nbsp;it;&nbsp;and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</p>
<p>Giving the son signs of his sonship — a robe, a signet ring, and shoes—the father restores him to the family. In the end, he couldn’t even eat carob pods in the foreign country to which he had gone to live as he wished. With his return home, he feasts at his father’s table.</p>
<p>If the parable ended there it would still be an important part of our spiritual literature. It would be an enriched variation on the pattern of loss, recovery, and joy that we see in the first two parables of the chapter. What it means to fail, repent, and be received by our Heavenly Father with joy, remembering our need to welcome our brothers and sisters who also return—these are central to the gospel message. They are about the Atonement.</p>
<p>But the parable does not end there. It turns to the elder son. Jesus has given two parables that show how things ought to be, three if we include the first part of this one. He finishes this parable by aiming directly at the way his critics are. It is about anyone who has the temerity to think they are among the “ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.7?lang=eng#6" target="_blank">Luke 15:7</a>).</p>
<p>So the parable continues in verses 25-28:</p>
<p>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.25-28?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">Luke 15:25-28</a>)</p>
<p>We know that something is amiss from the beginning of these four verses, for instead of going in to ask his father why the feast, the older brother stays outside and asks a servant. He quickly goes from suspicion to anger when he hears the reason. Now he not only does not go in, he <em>will not</em> go in. What does his father do? Does he say, “Then fine, stay outside if that’s what you want!” No, his response to his son’s anger is to go outside and urge him to come in to join the feast. He treats both sons the same: when they separate themselves from him, he goes out to meet them. He responds to their separation from him by moving toward them with compassion and entreaties.</p>
<p>But entreating the older son is not enough. Angrily he replies to his father:</p>
<p>Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.29-30?lang=eng#28" target="_blank">Luke 15:29-30</a>)</p>
<p>It is hard not to notice the accusatory tone of what the older son says. The Greek literally says “Lo, these many years I have slaved for you.” And he adds, “Neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment.” This son sees what he does for his father as mere servitude; he serves out of obedience rather than love. Notice, too, how the older son distances himself from his brother with the phrase “This thy son,” as if to say, “He may be your son once again, but he is not my brother.” Finally notice that the older son accuses the younger of more than there is evidence for in the story. The story tells us that the younger son wasted the money he got from selling his father’s property in extravagant living. It says nothing more about how he spent the money. But the older son, angry and humiliated, goes farther, saying that his brother spent that money on prostitutes. His anger carries him beyond both charity and the truth, as anger always does.</p>
<p>The older brother feels cheated, and he can give good reasons for feeling as he does. It is as if he is saying, “Why should I have bothered being the good son and keeping your commandments if you reward the son who has humiliated us and wasted your estate? I could have done what he did, run off and had a good time. But instead, I stayed and slaved for you.” The parable of the laborers in the vineyard (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/20.1-16?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Matthew 20:1-16</a>) raises a similar question. The feeling behind it is not hard to recognize in ourselves. Why bother living righteously if those who repent later in life—having been able to sin freely until then—receive the same reward? Haven’t they had an unfair advantage?</p>
<p>That thinking about others is a kind of jealousy. We wish we had been able to sin as much as they and then could repent later and get the same reward, as if living in sin were something good that we missed out on by living the commandments. When we think that way, we forget that obedience is a blessing rather than a privation. And when we think that way, then we, like the older brother, misunderstand the reason for our service. We do not serve merely because we have been commanded. We do not serve because we will be rewarded. We have been commanded and we will be rewarded. But Jesus gave us the reason for our service in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">John 14:15</a>:</p>
<p>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p>When we genuinely serve, we do so because we love our Savior and our heavenly Father. Of course obedience is important, but our heart should keep the commandments rather than our will or our calculation of reward. We should do what we do out of a loving heart.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine the father responding to the older son’s jealousy and accusation by explaining what is wrong with his attitude or arguing with him about the facts of what has happened. Anger would also not be surprising. But the father does none of those things. He doesn’t dispute with the son about whether what he has said is right. He doesn’t argue with him about the younger brother’s faithlessness or repentant faithfulness. He doesn’t offer to treat the older brother better in the future. In verse 31 he answers simply and factually:</p>
<p>Son, thou art ever with me, and all&nbsp;that I have is thine. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.31?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">Luke 15:31</a>)</p>
<p>What more could the older son want than everything—which the father has already given him? The father offers promise rather than rebuke. The closest he comes to rebuke is when, in verse 32, he gently says “this thy brother” in response to the older son’s earlier “this thy son.”</p>
<p>It was&nbsp;meet&nbsp;that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Luke 15:32</a>)</p>
<p>Our response to sinners wanting to commune with and eat the bread of the kingdom with our heavenly Father must be joy—even merry-making—rather than anger, criticism, and (implicitly) jealousy. After all, repentance means resurrection from spiritual death; it means recovery from loss. If we would be joyous over the rescue of a sheep or recovery of a coin, why not be much more joyous over the repentance of a brother or sister? And why not be equally joyous over the possibility of our own repentance?</p>
<p>We read of no more response to this parable than there was to the previous ones. Jesus leaves those who have criticized him in their silence to reflect on the three parables. He leaves a textual blank space, as it were, a moment for his listeners and readers to ask which child we are, the younger, the older, or (what I think is most likely) in some ways one and in other ways the other. He expects us to hear what He has said and come to an understanding of it: “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/14.35?lang=eng#34" target="_blank">Luke 14:35</a>).</p>
<p>If there were some nice, neat bundle of paraphrase into which we could wrap these parables, then they would not teach as much as they do. That makes it difficult to come to a conclusion, though I must, for your sake as well as mine. So let me conclude by listing some of the things that I think these parables teach:</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to listen today. Thanks to the university for inviting me. Thanks to our Savior, Jesus Christ, for providing us the opportunities we share. In particular thanks to him and the Father for the rescue and promise of the Atonement.</p>
