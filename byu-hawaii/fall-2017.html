<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, Aloha!&nbsp; Nancy and I truly are thrilled to be with you today.&nbsp; Everything that Nancy said about BYU and Hawaii is true.&nbsp; We are both thrilled and grateful to be here.&nbsp; You represent BYU at its finest.&nbsp; We feel your goodness and your love and we know that you love our Heavenly Father and His Son and that they love you.</p>
<p>One of my current assignments at Church headquarters is to serve on the Church’s Scriptures Committee.&nbsp; I have to confess that before I began serving on that committee I wasn’t quite sure what they did.&nbsp; I have been pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The scriptures have been and always will be one of the key components of our religion and one of the foundational ways the children of God come to know him.&nbsp; In fact, Joseph Smith said, “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion?&nbsp; We have none.”&nbsp; I think too often we take for granted these precious treasures—the scriptures.&nbsp; But think of it.&nbsp; The scriptures contain true accounts of God’s interactions with his children.&nbsp; Through them we learn of his love.&nbsp; Through them we learn of our eternal potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those of us who speak English have been blessed from the beginning with access to these sacred records, but many people in the world are only just now coming to have the scriptures, and particularly the Book of Mormon in their own language.</p>
<p>Serving on the scripture committee has given me the opportunity to discover just how many dedicated members of the Church are working tirelessly to translate the Book of Mormon into many languages.&nbsp; The full Book of Mormon or parts of it are now available in 111 languages, with 5 additional languages being translated.&nbsp; Many more people in the world are experiencing for themselves the power of the Book of Mormon and ultimately the reality of God’s love and their eternal potential.</p>
<p>I have had a special fondness for the Book of Mormon since the days of my youth.&nbsp; When I was young I lived on a farm and spent many days working in the fields.&nbsp; My parents were not active in the Church at that time so we did not read the scriptures in our home.&nbsp; But one day when I was about 12 years old I found a copy of the Book of Mormon in our home and after a morning of working in the hot sun I sat down under the shade of a tree and started to read the book.</p>
<p>I do not remember many things from my youth, but I distinctly remember reading that book for the first time.&nbsp; It was like nothing I had ever read.&nbsp; I felt so good.&nbsp; I did not recognize it at that time, but the Spirit was growing in my heart.</p>
<p>I did not want to stop reading so I found every spare minute to continue.&nbsp; Even with all of my farm chores, I was able to finish reading the book in just two weeks.&nbsp; As a young boy, I knew without any doubt that this book was good and that it contained the pure gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That testimony changed everything in my life.&nbsp; I came to know God the Father on a more personal level than I ever had before.&nbsp; He became very real.&nbsp; I came to love our Savior Jesus Christ with a greater purity that I ever had.&nbsp; I loved reading about his experience with the Nephites.&nbsp; Reading the book truly was a turning point in my life.&nbsp; The book has been and continues to be an anchor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I enjoy most when we come to Hawaii is the beautiful food that is available here—the fresh fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; I also love the gorgeous flowers.&nbsp; When God created these beautiful foods and flowers, he put within them a remarkable thing—he included seeds, tiny little packages which have the potential to become once again like the original plant.</p>
<p>It is amazing to think what can come from just one single seed.&nbsp; One single seed can be reproduced and multiplied to eventually become a gigantic field or a majestic orchard.&nbsp; Just one single seed.&nbsp; Seeds are powerful.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why in the Book of Mormon Alma compared the word of God to a seed.&nbsp; We are promised that if we will plant the word in our hearts—like we would plant a seed in the ground—we will reap the most delicious fruit, or in other words, the most delicious spiritual feelings.</p>
<p>I experienced that as a young boy.&nbsp; The words I was reading in the Book of Mormon were delicious to me.&nbsp; Alma goes on to teach us that we must be diligent and patient as the word grows in our heart—much as we must be diligent and patient when we grow crops.&nbsp; But with our effort, we are promised a rich harvest.&nbsp; The fruit is sweet and worth all the effort.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is one of the reasons our prophets have counseled us to read daily from the word—the scriptures, and particularly the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; As we constantly keep the word planted in our hearts, we can enjoy a never-ending harvest of delicious fruit.&nbsp; We can feast upon that feeling every day.&nbsp; We can feel God’s love constantly.</p>
<p>As members of the Church we believe that reading the Book of Mormon can produce this positive effect on any person—including people both in and out of the Church.&nbsp; To test this hypothesis, we recently conducted a very interesting experiment with non-members.&nbsp; I want to share with you the results of that experiment today.</p>
<p>We wanted to see how non-members would react and how they would feel after reading only one single random page of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; Rather than us trying to tell the world what the Book of Mormon is and what it's about, we sought to have the world tell us.&nbsp; We asked 531 non-members to each read one page of the Book of Mormon and become a representative, a witness to the world, of what that page says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As they were reading, the non-members were instructed to look for and underline any passages where they read about either Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Then they were asked to explain how they felt.&nbsp; The results of the experiment were incredible.&nbsp; Even from reading just one single page, non-members were able to feel the Spirit.&nbsp; They were experimenting upon planting the word, and they knew it was a good seed, or that the word was good.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, put yourself in the position of those in the experimental group.&nbsp; You are a millennial non-Mormon from somewhere around the world.&nbsp; Perhaps you’ve heard of the Book of Mormon, if so you most likely think it's a Broadway musical.&nbsp; Perhaps you know a Mormon or have met a missionary, and if so, you probably think you already know what they will say to you.&nbsp; You are curious, so you agree to take part in a simple experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, these experiments were conducted all over the world. People from every walk of life and from most every religion were involved, a true cross-section of Heavenly Father's children here on this earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I knew I would be coming here to your campus, I asked the team to conduct one of the experiments here in Hawaii.&nbsp; Here is a short video of the experiments from around the world.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the Book of Mormon speaks for itself, or rather, the voice of God is found within its pages.&nbsp; These children of God recognize and remember on a spiritual level that God is their Father.&nbsp; Much like children respond to the voice of their father here on earth, these children of God responded to their Eternal Father’s voice as found in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Let’s now enjoy the results of the experiment.</p>
<p>How do you think a Muslim would view the Book of Mormon?&nbsp; Rafi, a Muslim from London, read page 430 and remarked:</p>
<p>This is the first time that I have ever read a page of scripture. I think the page was good, it’s definitely good. It shows that God is a God of miracles, not a god of punishment. He’s merciful, he does miracles and he wants to help us. I believe that God is that way, he wants to help us. Reading this book has helped me. I love it!</p>
<p>How might a person respond who feels like they have been in the dark respond?&nbsp; Kate, who calls herself Non-Religious from Australia, read page 184 and then said:</p>
<p>It was one of the first pages of scripture that I have ever read. And I think that a book like this can help people find answers in their life when they feel like they are in darkness. I’m so grateful to have been part of this experiment…I’ve been in the dark and needed a little more light in my life.</p>
<p>Here is the response from Nazam, another Muslim from the UK who read page 239:</p>
<p>I can see a lot of similarities between what I read here and what I read in the Koran, I do not think the two are as different as many believe them to be. I think we actually believe very similar things. I felt good as I read it and as long as it is teaching people to be good to one another then I believe it to be good.</p>
<p>What about people who claim that we aren’t Christians?&nbsp; Will, an Atheist from Chicago had something to say about that.&nbsp; He read page 440 and wrote:</p>
<p>The page that I read seemed to reference the Old Testament and I could see that it was talking about Jesus. If anything talks about God this book does.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one page was simply not enough!&nbsp; Bianca, a Christian, from South Africa, read page 307 and shared:</p>
<p>Where's the next page? I want to read what happens next! I had always heard never to read more than the bible but this taught me the same things about Christ and His resurrection. I want to know more!</p>
<p>Incidentally after Bianca read her page it lead to an hour-long discussion about the Restoration of the Gospel and the blessing in having Another Testament of Jesus Christ on the earth today—the Book of Mormon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some responses made us chuckle.&nbsp; John, a Christian from South Africa in London, read page 232 and said:</p>
<p>I didn't know that I agreed with your doctrine. I think I am a secret Mormon!</p>
<p>Finding John was a pretty special experience in and of itself. The team was set up on the corner of Hyde Park and Marble Arch in London, at a little place known as Speaker’s Corner. For those familiar with the history of Missionary Work in the Church, this is the same location where the first missionaries from the Church sent to England preached the Gospel publically. Today this location is still reserved on Sunday as a public space for open discussion and preaching of religion.&nbsp; But the modern scene might best be described as chaotic and loud.&nbsp; There are people on soap boxes and people on ladders yelling with megaphones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John told us that he had moved to London from South Africa 22 years ago and had been coming every Sunday to Speaker’s Corner looking for religion.&nbsp; He had not felt the spirit of confirmation he had been searching for until he had stopped and read a page from the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; He exclaimed, “I didn't know I agreed with your doctrine. I think I am a secret Mormon.”</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon helped one woman remember spiritual experiences from her youth.&nbsp; Miriam, a middle-aged Christian woman from Brazil, read a wonderful page, page 478.&nbsp; She then said:</p>
<p>I was very sick when I was young and my mother told me everyday to ask for God’s help. When I was five God came to me and blessed me. My father was killed in a car accident when I was 19 and when I ran up to my room upset I asked God where He was and why He would let this happen. He told me that my earthly father was gone, but I would always have my Heavenly Father. I’m so glad you’re doing this. I had forgotten about those experiences until I read this page. Reading this book lets people remember their spiritual experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the favorite part for many who read the Book of Mormon?&nbsp; Lester, a Christian from the Philippines, read page 416 and then gave this beautiful and simple witness after reading his page:</p>
<p>I really liked the experiment.&nbsp; My favorite part was reading that Jesus is our Savior.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the world wants and needs a Savior and finding that second witness in the Book of Mormon is thrilling to anyone who receives it.</p>
<p>Many people are exposed to war and violence.&nbsp; How did the experiment help them?&nbsp; Amna, a Muslim from Pakistan, read page 397 and wrote:</p>
<p>This is a brilliant idea. You should take out an ad and tell people to be here.&nbsp; I woke up and turned on the TV today and all I saw was war, refugees, violence, and problems. The world needs to see this.&nbsp; To see that there is hope and love in the world and that God is good, this is what this world needs.&nbsp; I am so grateful to be part of the project. The whole world needs to see it.&nbsp; Thank you!!&nbsp; It's brilliant!</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we could keep going and going with one person after another, but you can see for yourself what one single page from the Book of Mormon can do to a child of God.&nbsp; People are hungry for words from their Father in Heaven and from their Brother and Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Perhaps this scripture from the Book of Mormon itself proclaims the power of these many witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2 Nephi 27 verse 14, which is quoting Isaiah we read:</p>
<p>“Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters as you leave this devotional this morning, you will see that we have set up the same experiment right outside these doors.&nbsp; You can see first-hand how the experiment was conducted, and—if you want to, even though you are members of the Church and already are familiar with the Book of Mormon, some of you can participate in the experiment yourselves.</p>
<p>Truly, the Lord continues to establish his word through many, many witnesses.&nbsp; But what about you personally, brothers and sisters?&nbsp; Are you taking advantage of the blessings of reading daily from the Book of Mormon?&nbsp; Are you following the counsel of modern day prophets to feast daily from this book?&nbsp; In his last General Conference address, President Thomas S. Monson reiterated the need for us each to sup daily from the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>“This morning I speak about the power of the Book of Mormon and the critical need we have as members of this Church to study, ponder, and apply its teachings in our lives. The importance of having a firm and sure testimony of the Book of Mormon cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>We live in a time of great trouble and wickedness. What will protect us from the sin and evil so prevalent in the world today? I maintain that a strong testimony of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of His gospel will help see us through to safety. If you are not reading the Book of Mormon each day, please do so. If you will read it prayerfully and with a sincere desire to know the truth, the Holy Ghost will manifest its truth to you. If it is true—and I solemnly testify that it is—then Joseph Smith was a prophet who saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<p>“Because the Book of Mormon is true, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s Church on the earth, and the holy priesthood of God has been restored for the benefit and blessing of His children.</p>
<p>If you do not have a firm testimony of these things, do that which is necessary to obtain one. It is essential for you to have your own testimony in these difficult times, for the testimonies of others will carry you only so far. However, once obtained, a testimony needs to be kept vital and alive through continued obedience to the commandments of God and through daily prayer and scripture study.”</p>
<p>Or dear prophet concludes:</p>
<p>My dear associates in the work of the Lord, I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day. As we do so, we will be in a position to hear the voice of the Spirit, to resist temptation, to overcome doubt and fear, and to receive heaven’s help in our lives. I so testify with all my heart …”</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I take seriously any counsel from a prophet, and I hope you do too.&nbsp; If you have not yet made reading daily from the Book of Mormon a part of your regular routine, I invite you to start today and to never stop.&nbsp; We need this book.&nbsp; This book that was preserved to come forth in purity in our day.&nbsp; Please, my dear brothers and sisters qualify for the blessings that can come to you from reading this book every day.&nbsp; Our living prophet of God is asking us to do that.</p>
<p>Just as a tiny seed can become a mighty forest, the tiny seed of the word planted in your heart can lead you to become one day like your Father in Heaven.&nbsp; Isn’t that ultimately what we all want?&nbsp; We want to return to our Father and enjoy a life like He has.&nbsp; As simple as it may seem, reading daily from the Book of Mormon, coupled with prayer will increase our faith in Jesus Christ, which then leads repentance and keeping our covenants with God.&nbsp; So really, the seed of the word is perhaps the most influential thing that will help bring us to this eternal reality.&nbsp; Plant the word, cultivate it with your diligence and patience and as the scriptures promise you will one day reap the rewards of your efforts.&nbsp; You will become like God.</p>
<p>May this be your goal and your reward is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>My Brothers and Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>And for those students who speak Chinese, Jou Sahn or Jau An</p>
<p>I would like to thank the President’s council for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today and I would like to begin by giving a little history about my family and pay tribute to my parents. Most of you are familiar with the Goo’s Plantation Store in the Hukilau Marketplace at the Polynesian Cultural Center. If some of you have not seen it yet, here is a picture of it. And here is a picture of my father’s old store. Which was located on the corner of Lanihuli Street and Naniloa Loop where our home now stands, which was built 27 years ago. The store at PCC not only uses our family name but also has a replica of the old Juke Box which was there. This was where many of the youth hung out and played their favorite songs. For 25 cents you could play 6 songs and their favorite snack was pake cake and soda. My father was asked to move to Laie when this university first started in 1955 to open a Snack Bar for the students and also a General Merchandise Store. He closed the Snack Bar after three years when the campus was completed. He operated the store for almost 30 years. During this time my father never lost faith in his customers. He often extended credit knowing he would never see his money. He was compelled by his own good fortune to help others. Some people said he was Laie’s one-man Relief Society.” My father had a sense of humor as he had a sign on the back wall of the store which he claimed was an Old Indian Saying which read:</p>
<p>“You ask for trust, I no give.</p>
<p>You get mad.</p>
<p>Then I give you trust.</p>
<p>You no pay.</p>
<p>I get mad.</p>
<p>Better you get mad...better we be friends.”</p>
<p>My father also served as a Branch President here on campus for a married student branch. He was very active in the temple and served as an ordinance worker and a sealer for many years. At the age of 80 he and my mother served their third mission as temple missionaries in the Hong Kong China Temple. My parents certainly set a great example for us to follow and I am so grateful to them and for my family members, especially my wife, children, their spouses, grandchildren, my siblings and their families. Now to the topic which I have chosen for today,</p>
<p>“ENTER TO LEARN GO FORTH TO SERVE”</p>
<p>I would like to share a personal experience in which I learned the value of serving others. This happened when I was called to serve as a young missionary back in 1965. I served in the Southern Far East Mission with headquarters in Hong Kong. After catching my last wave here at the Hukilau Beach and was then set apart by the Stake President, I went directly to Hong Kong by myself. Even though I am of Chinese ancestry I did not speak any Chinese which made it very difficult since there was no MTC in those days. In Hong Kong I saw beggars on the street and even small children in ragged clothes begging for money. Seeing this made me wonder and question why they were suffering so much. Why was I born and raised in Hawaii where I had everything that I needed as to food, clothing and shelter. It seemed to me that God was unfair. It bothered me so much that I decided to talk to my Mission President. I shared my concern with him and he asked me if I had read the book, “The Challenge”, which was one of the books required for all missionaries to read along with” Jesus the Christ” and “Articles of Faith”.</p>
<p>I told him that I had not yet read it and he asked me to read it and then go back to visit with him. While reading the book I came across this statement made by Elder Alvin R. Dyer that answered my question.</p>
<p>How else can be explained the apparent inconsistencies in the birth of people?</p>
<p>Without a knowledge of the gospel plan, a man, if he thought of these things, would become hardened. But there is a plan that governs all, for life upon this earth is not the beginning. We are here in this life by virtue of what we have been before. This is a matter of vital concern because it helps us to understand that we enjoy our position because of what we have done in the pre-mortal life. Upon visiting with my Mission President again, he shared with me that we are born here to a specific family, a specific place and at a specific time based on our performance in the pre-mortal world. The prophet Alma stated this in the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p>"And this is the manner after which they were ordained—being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such." After sharing this scripture with me, he told me the fact that I was born in Hawaii and those children whom I saw were born in Hong Kong or China did not make me better than them.</p>
<p>He further taught me that I now had a greater responsibility to share the Gospel with others and then he had me read another scripture:</p>
<p>"For of him unto whom much is given much is required."</p>
<p>After the visit with my Mission President I began to ponder and realized that I was given much and now it was required of me to serve with all of my heart, might, mind and strength. I made up my mind then that I would consecrate myself to the Lord not only while on my mission but also throughout my whole life. I vowed that I would accept every calling in the Church and do my very best to magnify it. In 1991 I suffered a heart attack and while I was home recovering, Elder John Groberg came to our home and called me to serve as a member of the Stake Presidency here on campus. Under the circumstances it was easy to say “no”. But since I committed myself to be a consecrated member of the church and I accepted the calling. After I was sustained and set apart by Elder Groberg he asked that I remain seated and he said:</p>
<p>“I feel I need to give you another blessing, a blessing of health. I feel very strongly that your missionaries are all praying for you at this time.”</p>
<p>He then proceeded to bless me with health and strength that I may fulfill my calling. With that special blessing I was able to serve with a grateful heart and reap the many blessings of serving the Lord and the students here on campus.</p>
<p>Now, my brothers and sisters, what does this have to do with us here today at BYU-Hawaii?</p>
<p>First of all, you have been valiant in the pre-mortal life. And because of that you are either born into an LDS home or are converted and are in the household of God. And we have all made a sacred covenant with the Lord when we were baptized. You are special and you belong to this chosen generation.</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said,</p>
<p>“In all ages, prophets have looked down through the corridors of time to our day. Billions of the deceased and those yet to be born have their eyes on us. Make no mistake about it—you are a marked generation. … “For nearly six thousand years, God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the second coming of the Lord. Some individuals will fall away, but the kingdom of God will remain intact to welcome the return of its Head—even Jesus Christ. “While this generation will be comparable in wickedness to the days of Noah, when the Lord cleansed the earth by flood, there is a major difference this time: [it is that] God has saved for the final inning some of His strongest … children, who will help bear off the kingdom triumphantly.”</p>
<p>You will be the future leaders of the church worldwide. Make no mistake about it, the Lord has guided you here for a reason and that reason is to help prepare you to administer and to bless humanity throughout the world. What an awesome responsibility and you have much to look forward to. In the October 2003 general conference Pres. Hinckley made this declaration:</p>
<p>"God bless you, my dear young friends.</p>
<p>You are the best generation we have ever had.</p>
<p>You know the gospel better.</p>
<p>You are more faithful in your duties.</p>
<p>You are stronger to face the temptations which come your way.</p>
<p>Live by your standards.</p>
<p>Pray for the guidance and protection of the Lord.</p>
<p>He will never leave you alone.</p>
<p>He will comfort you.</p>
<p>He will sustain you.</p>
<p>He will bless and magnify you and make your reward sweet and beautiful.</p>
<p>And you will discover that your example will attract others who will take courage from your strength."</p>
<p>What a glorious promise spoken by the prophet of the Lord. During my 34 years on this campus and serving in various positions such as Associate Dean of students and several years as Stake President, I met many students from all over the world. In visiting with them I found a common element in each of the students. I found that they were guided here by the Lord and they were not here by chance. If I were to talk to you today most of you have a story to tell as to how you came here. Many of you may recall the nerve wracking time when you went to the US consulate to be interviewed for your visa. All of you whether from foreign countries or the mainland or even from Hawaii may also recall the many prayers in which you so earnestly pleaded to the Lord to help you to get here. Now that you are here what is your plan to follow our school Motto of “Enter to learn, Go forth to serve”.</p>
<p>Seeking an education is a noble and a worthwhile pursuit. It will provide you the opportunity to gain knowledge, self-confidence and a career in the future. The more important element to your success in life depends greatly on your spirituality and your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and your relationship with Him. Someday when you leave this campus I hope you don’t just take with you a degree but also many experiences of service which has strengthened you and enabled you to serve worldwide in blessing the lives of many. I would like to share with you some examples of former students who have entered here to learn and they went forth to SERVE. They are all personal friends of ours and been great examples to us.</p>
<p>The first one is:</p>
<p>Eni Hunkin and his wife, Hinanui</p>
<p>After graduating from Kahuku High School he attended this institution for 2 years and then transferred to BYU where we were roommates. He then completed his Juris Doctorate and Masters of Law degrees. He served in many positions in the American Samoa government including Lieutenant Governor and as a member of the United States House of Representatives for 26 years. He was a Ranking member of several committees in Congress. He was an active member of the Church and was instrumental in assisting the Church in obtaining recognition in several Asian and Pacific countries. He loved playing the ukulele and singing. He passed away this past February. The next example is Sosaia Paongo and his wife, Marie. He and his wife and children are our good friends. After graduating from CCH he returned home to Tonga and served there in the Church Schools for over 30 years as a teacher, principal, school administrator and rugby coach. He also served in many callings in the church including serving as a Bishop and a Stake President. After returning to Laie several years ago, his wife, Marie, worked with us in the International Student Services Office. They are now living in Utah and he is serving as a Stake Patriarch. And I must add he is an avid Golfer. Another example is Sam Wong and his wife Carol. We have known the Wongs for many years.</p>
<p>I remember when Carol graduated and went back to Hong Kong and after meeting Sam they both returned for him to receive his degree. After completing his education they returned to Hong Kong and set up his consulting business and began serving in the Church. He served as a Bishop, Stake President, Area Seventy in the Asia area and is now serving as a member of the First Quorum of Seventy. His current assignment is serving as the President of the Canada Vancouver Mission which they started this past July.</p>
<p>The last example is: Stanley Wan and his wife Katheen. He was in our campus ward and served as our Ward Executive Secretary. I have always admired him for his diligence in keeping a daily journal which he still continues. After returning to Hong Kong he served in many Church positions such as Bishop, Stake President, Mission President, Area Seventy and as the Church’s China Administrator Unit Director. He is now retired and living in Hong Kong and Utah. I also remember him as the Ping pong champion when he was at school. These are only a few examples of the many thousands of students who have entered here and went forth to serve. Here are a couple of other examples. A few years ago on a visit to San Francisco we attended the Chinese ward. When we walked in we were amazed to see so many BYU-Hawaii alumni. The most gratifying thing was to discover that most of the leadership of the ward was comprised of all BYU-Hawaii alumni. You cannot imagine the pride as well as the joy we felt in our hearts as we watched them in action in providing leadership there in San Francisco. We recently served a mission in New York among the Chinese. While there we met with some of the alumni. In the Brooklyn Chinese branch, the Branch President, Jeremy Yau, is an alumnus as well as his wife Kristy. In the Flushing Chinese ward, the Bishop is Hanson Chan along with his wife, Amanda, and they are both alumni. We are so proud of these alumni who are carrying the legacy of this campus wherever they go. Someday it will be your turn to take this legacy of service throughout the world. This is the power of BYU-Hawaii and the Aloha spirit all of you have experienced here, will go with you wherever you go. Now you must prepare yourselves by consecrating your life to the work of the Lord and He in turn will bless you abundantly. This very familiar scripture states:</p>
<p>“But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.” I can testify to you that this is true because I have experienced it over and over again. Seek to fulfill that which is spiritual in your life and the rest will be added unto you. To help us focus on what is important in our lives and to prepare you for a life of service, I have come up with four suggestions.</p>
<p># 1 Temple attendance</p>
<p>My wife and I recall the days when we saw students passing our home on their way to the temple especially on Saturday mornings. It was such a beautiful sight to see all these handsome young men and beautiful young women dressed in their Sunday best walking up the hill to enter the House of the Lord to do the work of saving souls. The temple is like a magnet which draws the faithful to enter the Lord’s house and in it they will find peace, joy and personal revelation to bless their lives. Our Heavenly Father loves us and He has built temples for us to bless our lives. We need to strive to make Temple Worship a Pattern in our lives. Elder David A. Bednar said in the last October conference. “A principal purpose of the temple is to elevate our vision from the things of the world to the blessings of eternity. Removed for a short time from the worldly settings with which we are familiar, we can “look to God and live” by receiving and remembering the great and precious promises whereby we become partakers of the divine nature “.</p>
<p>President Monson said,</p>
<p>“Now my brothers and sisters, we have built temples throughout the world and will continue to do so. To you who are worthy and able to attend the temple, I would admonish you to go often. The temple is a place where we can find peace.</p>
<p>President Monson also stated that,</p>
<p>“I would counsel you to go often. Doing so will strengthen marriages and families.”</p>
<p>President Packer said,</p>
<p>“The Lord will bless us as we attend the temple. We will be blessed in all of our affairs. We will be eligible to have the Lord take an interest in our affairs both spiritual and temporal.” This certainly includes blessing us is your school work, financially, socially and in all aspects of your lives. As you attend the temple be sure to pay close attention to the covenants which you make with the Lord and to make every effort to keep those covenants. A covenant comes with promises from the Lord but it also comes with obligations on our part. Fulfill your obligations and the Lord will fulfill His promise to bless and to guide you. Since our temple in Laie is so close and in walking distance we should follow Elder Richard G. Scott’s example by going once a week. We could do a half hour of initiatory one week, sealing’s for half an hour the next week and then an endowment session every 3rd week. Those of you who are not endowed could do baptisms once a week and the baptistery is open on Tuesdays thru Fridays from 7-9 am and 2-4 pm for walk-ins. I would also recommend that those students who have been endowed become temple ordinance workers and you can serve a 4 hour shift once a week. There is always a need for ordinance workers. Sister Goo and I serve on the Friday evening shift and we love the students we serve with.</p>
<p>#2 Take advantage of your education here on this campus and be diligent in pursuing your education. How many hours should you study out of class for every hour spent in class? I strongly recommend that you spend two hours of study out of class for every hour you spend in the class room. So for example if you are carrying twelve credit hours, you should be studying at least 24 hours per week or on the average of 4-5 hours per day, Monday to Friday. You should write up a daily schedule so you can block in the times you are in classes, studying for your classes and other times for work and extra-curricular activities. You should also remember to use the power of the Holy Ghost in your studies and remember to pray before and after you study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#3 serve a mission</p>
<p>Our former Prophet, Spencer W. Kimball answered this question, “Should every young man fill a mission? And the answer has been given by the Lord. It is “Yes.” Every young man should fill a mission. The Lord said:</p>
<p>“Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations, first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the Jews.”</p>
<p>A mission is not a casual thing, it is not an alternative program of the Church. Every man should also pay his tithing. Every man should observe the Sabbath. Every man should attend his meetings. Every man should marry in the temple and properly train his children, and do many other mighty works.” In other words, it is a commandment of the Lord for young men to serve a mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4 Find opportunities to serve others</p>
<p>A few years ago Bill Shum was a student here on campus. Bill wore a tag on his shirt which said “My name is Bill Shum. What can I do for you? Bill used to cut hair for free for anyone who wanted one. Bill found great joy in giving service to people. We too can find joy in service by being aware of others’ needs. If you see your roommate or friend who is struggling with school work offer to tutor them. When the spirit whispers to you that someone could use a kind word or a helping hand to lighten their load, follow that prompting and reach out to help. There are many opportunities here for you to serve on this campus. May I suggest that each day you pray for the spirit to guide you to those who may need your help? When you do this now at your age it will someday be second nature to always reach out to help. You will be a blessing to many and the answers to many prayers. I bear you my testimony that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ both live and they answer our prayers. Our Savior died for each one of us and as we pray often and serve Him our lives will be blessed. I love them and I know that we will be blessed even more as we keep the commandments and serve with all of our hearts, might’s, minds and strengths. May we always remember that we are born here to this earth by virtue of what we have been before? And may we always remember our School Motto, Enter to learn, Go forth to serve. I love you all, and may the Lord bless and guide you all in all that you do and say. Thank you everyone and I share this with you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: center 243.0pt;">Brothers and Sisters Talofa and Aloooooha!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">I would like to thank President Tanner for this golden opportunity for me to address you today. This past Saturday I was taking my&nbsp;twin grandbabies home and in the car I said, “Hey, don’t forget grandma’s devotional on Tuesday, grandma is going to speak.” Huali, the oldest asked, “Grandma who asked you to speak?” I said, “The President of the University.” “How come he asked you to speak?” “Ah, maybe because I’m special.” She excitedly said, “Yay, I can’t wait for him to ask me to speak.” Hala’i her sister quickly said, “Not me, no thanks.” My grandbabies are just beginning to find their voice and learn how to sing gospel truths. So Huali will give all speeches and Hala’i will write them. Kilinahe their little sister is their boss. I love them with my heart!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">My dear friend Irene Lesuma and I were in the temple one Saturday morning waiting for our turn to do initiatory and she asked me how I was doing with my devotional preparations. I told her it’s coming along. She shared with me that the morning of her devotional she cried in her room and she asked, “Heavenly Father, are you really there.” I just smiled and giggled. I really wanted to laugh but we were in the temple. She reassured me that I will do just fine. I would like to tell my dear friend Irene that Heavenly Father was definitely there during her devotional and she found her voice and shared with us beautiful melodies of the gospel that were both wonderful and inspiring. Now for me this morning, after I said my morning prayer, I was too excited to cry as my heart was racing, “Master the Tempest is Raging.” I know by the end of our devotional I will gladly say, “master, the terror is over, peace, peace, be still.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">I grew up in the village of Fitiuta, Manu’a in American Samoa. The only form of transportation between the main island of Tutuila and the Manu’a islands is a small steam ship that travels there once a week. There is no wharf so the ship would dock out in the blue ocean and the villagers would row a longboat out to meet the ship and pick up the supplies and the passengers. It is very dangerous and wet especially when the tide is high. I remembered one of those trips our family were told to wait for two missionaries that will be coming from Tutuila to Fitiuta. So, our family went to the shore to wait for the ship to arrive. I was watching from the shore as the men of the village rowed the longboat out to meet the ship, and for some reason my Dad wasn’t on the longboat. I saw two missionaries with white shirts standing on the edge of the ship getting ready to jump on to the longboat but they were stopped by some of the men indicating that they are not to board the longboat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">However, the men reached out for the missionaries’ suitcases. When they got the suitcases from the missionaries, they threw them in the blue ocean and I can see the suitcases floating away. My father saw what was happening to our palagi (Caucasian) missionaries so he waited until the longboat returned to shore. When they returned my Dad jumped in the longboat and told the men of the village that the two missionaries are ministers of his church and they are supposed to respect and honor them just like how they respect the minister of their LMS churchIt was this experience that was the beginning of the missionaries’ journey of finding their voice in the village of Fitiuta and find ways to continue to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Our family were the only members of the church in the village of Fitiuta.&nbsp;The rest of the village belonged to the LMS congregational church. We didn’t have a chapel. I don’t think we were officially a branch of the Church but missionaries were sent to our village because our family were members of the church. Our Sunday meetings were held at my grandfather’s house. We only had sacrament meeting which consist of an opening song and prayer, talks from the missionaries and blessing and passing of the sacrament and closing song and prayer. We didn’t have primary, so I didn’t know any primary songs, but somehow in my young life, through the teachings of the missionaries and my parents, I knew that:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I am a child of God, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And he has sent me here, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Has given me an earthly home with parents kind and dear. </span></em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And so my needs are great: </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Help me to understand His words, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Before it grows too late. </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I am a child of God, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Rich blessings are in store:&nbsp; </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If I but learn to do His will, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I’ll live with him once more.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">(chorus)&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lead me, guide me, walk beside me, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Help me find the way. </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Teach me all that I must do, </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To live with him some day.”</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Finding my voice and learning how to sing started at a very young age. My dad loved to play the guitar and sing those old Samoan folk songs that has 12 verses and 12 choruses. Thank goodness my Dad had a nice voice or it would have been difficult and problematic to listen to 12 versus and 12 choruses of the same song every day. My father played the trumpet. I don’t know who gave him the trumpet but he would blow the trumpet in the morning before he goes to the plantation and also at night after dinner. But I think it was more of a show off type of thing with my Dad because he was the only one in the village that had a trumpet and he wasn’t really playing an actual song. He would just blow two notes and hold it out really long as if it was a song then he would stop and then he would clean the trumpet, you know kind of making it like he was really a professional trumpet player.My two older sisters stayed with my grandparents but me and my brother stayed with my parents so we were exposed to music and these musical instruments while we were growing up. My brother is an accomplished guitar player and singer and he also plays the trumpet. My mother taught me how to play the piano and how to sing. I only knew how to play one song in the Samoan hymn book “ia fiafia pea.” It had no flats or sharps but it got my interest in playing the piano at a very young age. I was so proud to be able to play one song on the piano. In fact, my mother</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Would sometimes ask me to play that one song during our Sunday meeting. So, who was showing off now? When I think about it now, my father was showing off for the right reasons. You see, it was their musical talent and abilities that helped my parents and family to preach the gospel to the people of Fitiuta, Manu’a. Our missionaries were not allowed to proselyte or go into the people’s home. The people refused to hear about Joseph Smith. In fact, they would tease us and call us names like, “Iosefa Samita pepelo” meaning Joseph Smith is a liar or Joseph Smith’s story is false. The missionaries forge ahead with their work even when rejection by the people were a normal day for them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">President Hinckley in one of his conference talks titled, “Joseph Smith, Truly a Prophet,” said that an acquaintance said to him one day: &nbsp;As the missionaries continue to find ways to preach the gospel, one of the things that they did was to have our own activities on mutual nights. The nonmember children and youth in the village would come to our mutual nights and just sit outside and watch from outside of my grandfather’s house. They would listen to our music and watch us do our activities. They never ask to join us although we invited them. They were just curious as to what the Mormons were doing on Thursday night and Sunday nights when we have our firesides. These were the same children of those parents in the village that refused to let our missionaries into their homes. They were the same kids that would tease me and my brother at school or after school that we were mogamogas (cockroaches) rhymes with the word Mamona in Samoan which means Mormon in English. A lot of verbal confrontations and throwing of rocks those days between us and the kids of the village. I’m still alive today because I was very good at ‘alo (dodging) when the rocks are coming my way or run fast to get out of the way. Our missionaries experienced the same treatment from the people of Fitiuta.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">We as members of the church were solid as a rock in our testimony of the gospel even when the real rocks were thrown to us and to the missionaries, nothing is compared to what our earlier missionaries went through and suffered because of the stubborn people of Fitiuta at that time. This was way before my parents and our family moved to Fitiuta.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">One of those missionaries was the man by the name of Opapo Fonoimoana.The paper entitled, “Opapo-Man of Miracles.” This story is in the historical archives here in our school library.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">In that paper Carl wrote about his grandfather’s many miracles as he preached the gospel in Samoa. One of those places that he was sent to was Manu’a. Carl wrote, his grandfather had a dream, and in his dream he saw two palagi faifeau (Caucasian missionaries) foreign missionaries came to his village and walked right into his house and sat down. That was the end of his dream. But later on, when two Mormon missionaries entered into their village and came up to their house and walked in, he not only recognized the two as the men in his dream, but by his own account the spirit told him that the gospel message was true. It was then the stage was set for this simple man to do great work for the church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Carl continued,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: .5in; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">“Opapo Fonoimoana and his longtime friend Elisala and two white missionaries were sent to Manu’a. When they arrived, they found that their arrival has been forewarned and that the king Tuimanu’a had given strict instructions forbidding anyone from receiving, housing, feeding, clothing or assisting the Mormon missionaries in any way. It was a difficult situation for all concerned. Even though some people may have wanted to accept the missionaries and care for them, as is the normal custom to care and assist the ministers, the fear of reprisals from this dominant king his harsh edit was too much for anyone to go against.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: .5in; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: .5in; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">The consequence of accepting these missionaries would be an immediate stoning of that individual or individuals. The prospects of any conversion was hopeless. Nevertheless, the missionaries were very determined and stayed two months on Manu’a. Without other food to eat, they relied heavily on fallen coconuts on the beaches and small staples. Without a fale or house for shelter and sleeping, they had to dig holes on the beach. They would enter the deep holes and the last one would cover their heads with leaves as to protect them from mosquitos, each one taking a turn nightly to help the others arrange their leaves and then unassisted himself, suffering from mosquitos bites the rest of the night.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: .5in; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: .5in; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">After several weeks of this grueling ordeal, Opapo was awakened by the smell of some freshly baked food in a nearby basket. The missionaries did not know whether through human or divine source; but after weeks of coconuts, they were profoundly grateful. Near the end of their stay the incident was repeated when an elderly woman brought them some food, saying that if she had to die for her kindness, she would, but she did not fear Tuimanu’a. A few weeks later, after exhausting every possible avenue, the missionaries prepared to depart. Ceremonially, Opapo and Elisala spoke directly to tuimanu’a and his people, warning them that they would feel the wrath and power of God if they did not repent. As his last act before boarding the longboat, Opapo paused at the edge of the village and dusted off his feet as a witness against the island. A couple of weeks later a devastating hurricane struck the island, killing many, destroying all of the crops above ground, and leveling every house except one-the fale (hut) in which lived the elderly lady who had helped the missionaries. It is true that miracles strengthen the faith of believers but do not necessarily give faith to the unbelieving.”</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">I would like to believe that the elderly woman that helped Opapo and the missionaries was my grandmother, Malia. She is my Dad’s mother. And if it wasn’t her, then it is definitely something my grandmother Malia would do. She was a convert to the church. She too had a dream. In her dream, she saw 2 personages wearing white appearing on her That story has been told many times and the ulu tree became a landmark where people would go and see and be amazed. It was through this dream that my grandmother found her voice and never stopped singing in bearing testimony about Joseph Smith and the true gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Missionaries continued to come to Fitiuta. One of those great missionaries was Elder Larry Oler.We were in the same ward for a long time. He was the Dean of students here on campus and he helped a lot of students especially pacific islanders since he served both in Samoa and New Zealand as principal of the church schools.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Elder Oler helped my Dad strengthen his testimony of the gospel especially about the word of wisdom. He stopped smoking kapaa (Samoan cigarettes) and was ordained the Aaronic Priesthood. My Father’s testimony and faith were tested when he went against the rules of the village. The matai system in the village was very prevalent and they had strict rules that govern the affairs of the village. My dad was part of the aumaaga, the young single and married men of the village that takes care of some of the affairs of the village. He continued to serve with the village aumaaga even as a member of the church. That was his duty to serve in the village. The men of the village were not pleased with him because he became a Mormon. Those days the village worshipped certain idols of a prominent king or high chief of stature in manu’a. They built a pa (tower) of black rocks. This is situated right in the walkway or path where the people of the village pass as they walk to their plantations or to go fishing. They are expected to pay their respect when they pass the tower of black rocks with complete silence. At this time my father’s testimony of the church was solid and he knew there is only one God and we should not worship idols, so he decided that he was going to destroy this tower of rocks, and he did. The matais of the village heard about it and discovered that their idol tower was completed demolished and it was no longer there. So, the word went around the village and it was told to my dad and our family that my dad will die the very next day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Well, my father not only moved his family from Samoa to Hawaii in 1969 so we can be sealed in the temple and for his children to have a better education. He retired from BYU-Hawaii as a landscaper and worked as an ordinance worker in the temple until his passing. My dad didn’t know any English when he arrived here. So how did he become a temple ordinance worker if he didn’t know any English? He self-taught himself by pronouncing the words and ask his children to help him pronounce them back and visa versa. President David Hannemann, then the President of the Laie Hawaii Temple would always tell me when he sees me that, “Your father is a very spiritual man and he takes his work in the temple very seriously. I would find your dad in an empty room in the temple praying and studying.” He continued to be this kind of example to us his children and to others. He would proudly tell us, you know I work as a landscaper at BYUH and they are my boss, but when the professors come to the temple, I am their boss. He was so proud to work as a session officiator in the temple.&nbsp;He knew the church was true and he would give his life for it. There was a story that was told by one of the apostles in his conference talk about a child being trapped in a hole in the ground, who could only be extricated by sending another smaller child into the tunnel. One little fellow was approached to see if he would be willing to go down and rescue the one who was lodged. The lad said, “I am scared to go in that hole, but I will go if my father will hold the rope.” My father found his voice in the gospel of Jesus Christ and he never stopped singing wonderful and righteous melodies of the gospel. He has been holding that rope for me and my siblings and he has never let go. He taught us children what he knew and never stop teaching us even when it was difficult for him at times.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">My Dad was a 5<sup>th</sup> grade dropout. He stopped going to school so he can take care of his mother. He was a fisherman by trade and worked very hard in his plantation and every day he would go to his plantation in the mountains and gather coconuts and dry the coconut meat out in the sun and then sell the dry meat to the government to make oil and this was the way he earned money for our airfares to come to Hawaii.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">In a talk given by Elder Russell M. Ballard, entitled, “Let Our Voices Be Heard” he stated,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">I mentioned that my Dad had a 5<sup>th</sup> grade education. I also mentioned that my siblings and I were teased a lot in school because we were Mormons. So my Dad and Mom would encourage us kids to do well in school. To my parents, this would be another way for us Mormons to preach the gospel and to show that Mormons are really smart and hopefully it will lessen the teasing or completely stop it. So no pressure there for me and my brother, but we did just that. In those days in elementary school in Fitiuta, they have what we called “Lau Togi” or calling of final grades, where all of our parents would come to school at the end of the school year and the principal would call out loud the top 3 students of each class. It was a big deal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Parents would anxiously wait for their kids names to be called. I’m happy to say that I was always first place in the top 3 kids of my class and I even skipped grade and moved up to my brother’s class and we graduated together in 1973 from Kahuku High School. Not bad yeah. I’m not sharing this with you to boast about me, well maybe I am, but it’s okay. It was a long time ago. I’m old now. My parents were right about us doing well in school. We earned the respect from the principal and the teachers and even the kids of the village. They became our friends and the teasing stopped. We were known to be the smart Mormon kids. I have wonderful memories of my parents growing up and how much love they have for us and they would do anything to make sure we succeed even in hard times.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">There will be times when we will lose our voice and would stop singing due to our disobedient to the Lord’s commandments. I know my brother doesn’t mind me sharing this. My brother was an all-star football player from Kahuku high school. He was an all-state and all American. He had a full ride scholarship to the University of Wyoming. My father loved watching his son played football so when Wyoming was going to play BYU he wanted to go to the mainland and watch that game. This was his first trip to the mainland. He stayed with my brother and his roommate. Wyoming beat BYU that year. My dad was happy for my brother and his team but at the same time he was sad. It was constantly in his mind the fact that when he opened the refrigerator in my brother’s apartment</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">He found the refrigerator full of cans of beer. Before my Dad returned to Hawaii, in his own father and son conversations and counseling he told my brother, “if you do not honor your priesthood, you will never play professional football.” long story short, my brother was invited to try out for the Oakland raiders and he got hurt and never had the opportunity to play pro football. My brother was bitter for a long time and he even told me that our dad cursed him. I told him that our Dad didn’t curse him. He merely reminded him of his upbringing in the church especially honoring his priesthood and how important that is in his life and all the blessings that come with it. He continued to be inactive. But just last year, he called me from Montana if I had sent the missionaries to his home and I told him No. He said that the missionaries showed up to his home and they also invited him to go to church. He did go to sacrament meeting. I encouraged him to continue to go to church and also take his wife with him. I reminded him of his foundation in the church when we were young and that he needs to return back to church and enjoy the many wonderful blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He is trying and hopefully he will return back to full activity in the church for I know it will bless his life and that of his family. On a side note, even though he didn’t play pro football, he was inducted into the University of Wyoming Hall of Fame last year. I was able to go up to Wyoming and represented our family and supported my brother for this honor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">How can we restore our voice and sing again? In President David O. McKay words,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">President David O. McKay words are definitely true. Missionary work in Fitiuta Manua’s did not go unnoticed. The seeds of the gospel were planted and it has flourished decades later. Many of those little kids that teased us as mogamogas or cockroaches are now members of the church and have served as bishops and wives to bishops and relief society presidents. Some of them have become Stake Presidents both in Samoa and in the mainland. Their children have served missions. I spoke with President Art Hannemann recently and he said missionary work is doing well in Manu’a. There is a couple missionary in Fitiuta and two sister missionaries. That is so wonderful and I’m elated for the women of the church in Fitiuta. He said the men are still working on the word of wisdom but they will eventually see how important it is for them to be worthy and seal their families in the temple. Elder Ronald A. Rasband talk’s in this past October general conference titled, “The Lord’s hand is guiding you. By “Devine design”, shared with us when President Thomas S. Monson said to Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, “There is guiding hand above all things. Often when things happen, it’s not by accident. One day, when we look back at the seeming coincidences of our lives, we will realize that perhaps they weren’t so coincidental after all.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">I know and believe that everything that happened in my life growing up in Fitiuta was not coincidental. Remember that one song that my mother taught me on the piano? My calling right now in my ward is the assistant organist. I didn’t take any formal piano lessons. I only learned from my mother but I took it upon myself to learn about sharps and flats and practiced and now I can play a lot of songs and serve our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">I love our living prophet Thomas S. Monson and I know he is the mouthpiece of the Lord upon this earth.<strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">&nbsp;</span></strong>I love President Gordon B. Hinckley. He was a counselor to President Harold B. Lee in 1973 when he spoke these words in his talk entitled, “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.” We are the only church can properly sing, “We thank thee O God, for a Prophet to guide us in these latter days. We either have a prophet or we have nothing; and having a prophet, we have everything.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">In conclusion, I would like to sing and along with the choir this beautiful song called, “What is this thing that men call death?” President Gordon B. Hinckley wrote this poem. Janice Kapp Perry was asked to put it to music. President Hinckley was our prophet at a time in my life when I lost my own voice but through repentance I was able to restore my voice and sing again. With my firm testimony of the true gospel of Jesus Christ, I will never lose my voice again. This beautiful song was sung at President Hinckley’s funeral.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">What is this thing that men call death,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">This quiet passing in the night?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">'Tis not the end but genesis</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Of better worlds and greater light.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">O God, touch Thou my aching heart</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">And calm my troubling, haunting fears.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Let hope and faith, transcendent, pure,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Give strength and peace beyond my tears.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">There is no death, but only change,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">With recompense for vict'ry won.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The gift of Him who loved all men,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Son of God, the Holy One.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahalo nui loa to all the BYU-Hawai’i ohana and my ohana that have provided time, talent, service and patience in preparation for today’s devotional.&nbsp; I don’t have the list of all of your names and I don’t want to forget or miss anyone, so please accept my apology for not naming you specifically.&nbsp; But in my heart and prayers I thank you for your major actions and efforts.&nbsp; It has been challenging for all involved to put this together as I’ve been in California and New York for ten days with limited communication and just returned home on Sunday.&nbsp; A week or so of wearing double socks, shoes, gloves, scarves and a thick winter jacket has reminded me how great it is to live in Hawaii and to be back in the islands, home sweet home, what a blessing.</p>
<p>The music, singing, prayers and scripture sharing were choice, which surely invited the sweet spirit of peace and calmness to be here today. I know that Heavenly Father loves each of you dearly and he has a message for you.&nbsp; This task is quite overwhelming and intimidating and I don’t feel equal to the task, but I trust with faith, your prayers, the guidance of the spirit and Heavenly Father’s blessing I can deliver that message today. As Joseph Smith declared, “We have nothing to fear if we are faithful.”&nbsp; Carry on!</p>
<p>To my beloved brothers and sisters from all parts of the world, near and far, Aloha.</p>
<p>The university bulletin that listed today’s devotional included a simple request for the university ohana.&nbsp; Did you notice that I posed a couple of questions for you to ponder that relates to the devotional topic entitled TIED TO … I hope you had an opportunity to do that.&nbsp; Let me elaborate. What does the phrase “tied to…” mean to you? I checked the dictionary and also asked about ten others for their definition of tied to.&nbsp; The answers were very similar.&nbsp; Anchor, grab, grasp, join, connected, bound, hold on, related to.</p>
<p>Now let me offer you the completed thought in a question.&nbsp; What do we tie ourselves to?&nbsp; Keep that thought in mind as we move forward.</p>
<p>Sister Julie B. Beck, who was the 15th general president of the Relief Society from 2007 to 2012.&nbsp; I was serving as the Stake Relief Society President in the BYUH Married Stake at that time and heard her share this story.</p>
<p>“My parents, who had been my neighbors, announced that they would be moving to another part of the world. I had relied on my mother’s nurturing, wise, and encouraging example. Now she was going to be gone for a long time. This was before e-mail, fax machines, cell phones, and Web cameras, and mail delivery was notoriously slow. One day before she left, I sat weeping with her and asked, “Who will be my mother?” Mother thought carefully, and with the Spirit and power of revelation which comes to women of this kind, she said to me, “If I never come back, if you never see me again, if I’m never able to teach you another thing, you tie yourself to Relief Society. Relief Society will be your mother.</p>
<p>Three different women held the calling of Relief Society president in my wards during the years my parents were away. Alta Chamberlain invited me to teach time management and home organization to the other sisters, perhaps because she saw that I needed to improve those skills. Jeanne Horne encouraged me to complete my first serious personal study of the Book of Mormon. Norma Healey gave me my first assignments at the cannery and taught me much about service. These wonderful women understood the purpose of Relief Society.</p>
<p>Mother knew that if I was sick, the sisters would take care of me, and when I had my babies, they would help me. But my mother’s greatest hope was that the sisters in Relief Society would be powerful, spiritual leaders for me. I began from that time to learn abundantly from women of stature and faith.</p>
<p>When I heard this talk, I looked it up and read it again.&nbsp; I felt as if she were telling my story and speaking directly to me.&nbsp; I felt an immediate connection, a bonding with Sister Beck and her situation.&nbsp; Sister Beck’s story, her understanding of her mother’s counsel to tie herself to Relief Society has resonated in my mind then and for years I’ve tried to follow that simple and wise counsel to tie yourself to the things of the Lord, His word, the Atoning sacrifice of our Savior, Jesus Christ, the reassuring spirit of the Holy Ghost, the principles of the gospel, the Priesthood, to faithful Saints, to the sacred covenants of baptism and the temple and the list continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as we move forward in life and we follow this simple admonition to anchor ourselves, grab &amp; grasp on to, join or connect to, bind, hold on or tie yourself to these foundational stakes, the question becomes personal, what do you tie yourselves to and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Beliefs, vision, mission, miracles, the journey, promises, covenants, leaders/mentors, family/friends, priorities</p>
<p>Let’s share a few vignettes of these special angels whose values fit this description and fulfill that role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>About six months after we were married my husband Boysie and I moved into a new ward in his hometown, Kaneohe. I was born and raised on Maui, majority of my immediate family lived there, more specifically, my mom.&nbsp; We had a great relationship, but it was long distance and the only way for me to communicate was to write letters.&nbsp; It was a hard and lonely time. We had no cell phones at that time.&nbsp; Calling long distance was expensive, especially for us as a young couple with just one income.&nbsp; I didn’t know my in-laws well, or the neighbors or the city.&nbsp; I was insecure and somewhat fearful of the unknown.&nbsp; My husband was working full time and my close friends were in the mainland attending college or lived on another island.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father knew that I needed the same thing as Sister Beck and he provided and angel in my life.&nbsp; Enter Sister Betty Poliahu, Kaneohe 2nd Ward Relief Society President.&nbsp; She is one of the sweetest and kindest women I’ve ever met in my life.&nbsp; She welcomed me into Relief Society with open arms, made me feel accepted and loved.&nbsp; She, along with the other sisters of that ward took me under their wing, taught, loved and nurtured me.&nbsp; They shared their wisdom and talents allowing me to develop my skills and I learned how to cook, to budget, to teach, to be a better wife and mother.&nbsp; I learned how valuable and essential Relief Society and that divine sisterhood was to developing and understanding my role as a beloved daughter of God.&nbsp; Those experiences with that wonderful, loving ward grounded me.&nbsp; I lived in Kaneohe II Ward for about seven precious years before moving to Kahuku.&nbsp; I feel that warmth and acceptance when I return there to attend church with my mother-in-law, Helene.&nbsp; I feel the bonding and feel that special connection every Tuesday, late afternoon when I see Sister Betty Poliahu at the temple.&nbsp; She’s leaving the day shift and I’m coming to work at the night shift.&nbsp; It feels so symbolic and natural to me as if that nurturing relationship continues, it didn’t skip a beat and I continue to be influenced by her spirit of goodness, service and dedication to the Lord. To all those wonderful Kaneohe Ward members, mahalo nui loa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To all of you, Heavenly Father knows what you need, you just need to do your part and tie yourself to those that He places in your life. It’s always a win-win situation when you tie yourself to the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example can be found in Sisters, Eloise Richards and Beatrice Kailiponi were steadfast members of the Wailuku Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the valley isle of Maui. They were recognized as competent, dedicated, knowledgeable leaders in Primary, Relief Society and other community organizations.&nbsp; They were credited with initiating and implementing various programs and helpmeets, such as the first 72 Hour Emergency Kit on Maui and the Kupuna Program for public schools&nbsp; &nbsp;Teachers by profession and dedicated genealogists by choice, they offered guidance, expertise, secular and religious education, compassion, humor, discipline and care to all.&nbsp; They, their spouses and children provided years of service.&nbsp; These women shared their love, attention and home willingly and often to a very impressionable little girl whose parents divorced when she was four years old.&nbsp; Her parents were good individuals but not active in church.&nbsp; So she would ask her mother to drop her off at church where she would sit with either Sister Richards or Sister Kailiponi during Sacrament Meeting.&nbsp; After church she would spend majority of the Sunday with their family at their home.&nbsp; She ate meals with them, discussed future plans and felt like one of the immediate family.&nbsp; She observed and participated in family prayers, outings, events and it filled a void, one of being a complete family.&nbsp; She loved the feeling and spirit within the walls of their homes and the lessons she learned in church. The little girl witnessed the two families saving their money and vacation time as they prepared to travel to O’ahu every year to do temple work for the whole week.&nbsp; These caring, unselfish sisters made a marked difference and a lasting impression.&nbsp; They became mentors for this little girl and consistently magnified their Christlike attributes in such a way that this little girl’s hopes and dreams started to take shape, to possibly become a reality.&nbsp; She wanted what they had, an eternal family that attended church regularly, a temple attending family that lived, loved and shared the gospel with others.&nbsp; She saw the adult children in their families go to college and serve missions.&nbsp; She understood the Lord’s admonition to study, learn and serve and desired to have this in her life when she grew up.&nbsp; As time went by she became more confident and determined to follow their example and create a spiritual refuge for her own future family.&nbsp; That little girl was me and Aunty Eloise and Aunty Bea were my grandfather’s sisters.&nbsp; I hope that as they help guide and direct me from the other side of the veil that they are pleased with my choices to follow in their footsteps so we can be reunited in the eternities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can follow Aunty Eloise and Aunty Bea’s example by providing the safe haven in our homes, work settings and families for nurturing opportunities where we can truly cultivate our love for each other as we serve and love the Savior.&nbsp; Elder Marvin J. Ashton teaches us that “Home should be an anchor, a port in a storm, a refuge, a happy place in which to dwell, a place where we are loved and where we can love. Home should be where life’s greatest lessons are taught and learned.”</p>
<p>In 1949, eager 17 year old, Beautruss “Sweetie” Hussey, my mom was looking to make her mark in the world.&nbsp; She was a popular, smart, beautiful, talented singer, and recent convert to the church with hopes to attend college.&nbsp; Graduation was around the corner and her plans for the future seemed to be at a stand still, enter, tall, dark and handsome Army Master Sargent Eassie Miller, Sr., my dad.&nbsp; He was dashing and much sought after, but he became enamored with my mom and directed all of his attention her way.&nbsp; She saw all the dreams could be realized sooner than she thought, a loving, mature husband, independence, an opportunity to be out of her parent’s home, a chance to go to college, it all seemed possible.&nbsp; So they were married and for a while marriage was wonderful.&nbsp; Unfortunately, nine years later, after having four children, my parents divorced and they parted ways.&nbsp; At that time it was uncommon to be divorced, so we were in the minority.&nbsp; It was uncomfortable and I remember the stigma that seemed to accompany single parent families.&nbsp; The divorce was regrettable but my parents remained close friends the rest of their lives and although he moved to O’ahu, whenever we got together our friends would often comment that our parents didn’t act like they were divorced. Bea stayed on Maui close to her family where they were able to assist her as she shouldered the burden of single parenthood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lacking the necessary work experience required to provide for our young family, Mom’s life became a continual circle of self-sacrifice, as she accepted jobs that would allow for the flexibility in allowing my siblings and I to often times accompany her to work at her second or third job.&nbsp; We enjoyed being with her but also realized there was rarely any time for her to rest; she just seemed to be working all the time. Life was difficult, and rewards were few but she never complained about her situation.&nbsp; She was a kind hearted, hard working, loving and devoted mother that put her family first and foremost.&nbsp; My two aunts offered my mom the option of going to the University of Hawaii to attend school while they would care for us.&nbsp; She declined because she felt it was more important for her to be with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mom never talked bad about our dad to us.&nbsp; Although she took the brunt of the child raising responsibilities she was thoughtful and sensitive to our needs to have a positive relationship with our dad.&nbsp; Because she withheld her negative comments regarding our dad, that charitable act allowed us to love our dad, that when we matured we were able to see his weaknesses, but by then we loved him and things balanced out.&nbsp; As adults, my siblings and I realized what a sacrifice our mom had made.&nbsp; She gave up the chance to be the good guy in the relationship and instead just kept devoting her life to us, her children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mom taught me to be kind, loving and forgiving.&nbsp; She taught me that hard, honest work built character and allowed you to be independent and self reliant.&nbsp; She was an example.That true and selfless sacrifice was the legacy she left for her posterity to remember her by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen counsels, “Our spiritual journey is the process of a lifetime. We do not know everything in the beginning or even along the way. Our conversion comes step-by-step, line upon line. … But we are not alone.”&nbsp; We have tailor made trials, one size too big for us to carry alone. Like my mom, in spite of the difficulties and major challenges, she would say, “I pray to Him,” knowing she could turn to the Lord daily for solace.&nbsp; D&amp;C 24:8: "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days."</p>
<p>Merrilee Webb came to BYU-Hawaii as a choir director for a one year contract.&nbsp; She was a fireball, energetic, excited about life learning, music and people.&nbsp; She reminds me of the Duracell bunny, because she never seemed to run out of energy.&nbsp; The first day of class, she had 4 boys in the men’s choir, and 25 women in the women’s choir.&nbsp; She took it upon herself to recruit as many students as possible, roaming the hallways, dorms, cafeteria, and the aloha center looking for students to sing.&nbsp; “Everyone can sing,” was her motto.&nbsp; She was successful and her enthusiasm was contagious.&nbsp; She inspired and excited her students to sing a variety of songs.&nbsp; She would take the time and explain the meaning of each song, highlighting the descriptive language being used, the musical terms and so forth.&nbsp; I remember watching students literally running to her class, not because they were late but because they didn’t want to miss a minute of class time.&nbsp; Her goal was to memorize each of her students by name and face, and she would pray for them individually.&nbsp; Her class would host weekly Wednesday devotionals, and she would pray to see which student should offer their spiritual thought or story that week.&nbsp; It was a highlight of the week and the students were always eager to see “who’s turn was next.”&nbsp; We soon realized that Sister Webb truly led by the spirit.&nbsp; We witnessed time and time again how these devotionals ending up being a forum/venue for stories from students around the world, about sacrifices, major challenges and circumstances that were heart wrenching.&nbsp; However, the joy was seeing students testimonies strengthened and shared freely.&nbsp; We have memorable experiences of concerts where many of us, along with the audience felt the influence of the spirit and the spirit of angels singing along with us.&nbsp; She was so much more than a music teacher.&nbsp; She taught us to love the Lord, to be worthy of the prophets presence, to resolve conflicts, lift others burdens and sing with bright eyes and joyous spirits.&nbsp; My youngest daughter, Kieiki had one last semester to complete before graduation.&nbsp; She was the Student Body President at the time, her schedule was full with 21 credits.&nbsp; She had one more required class to take to complete her Minor in Economics.&nbsp; She came to me and explained that her Economics class was at the same time as Sister Webb’s class and this was the last semester Sister Webb would be teaching at BYU-Hawaii.&nbsp; She had a choice to make; graduate with a Minor in Economics or sing in Sis. Webb’s choir.&nbsp; She said, “I need to take Sister Webb’s class.&nbsp; I need that spiritual strength more.”&nbsp; I agreed and she has never regretted that decision.&nbsp; We both count the blessings of Merrilee Webb’s influence in our lives.&nbsp; She would remind us before each concert that this is not a performance, instead this is an opportunity to share the gospel, the spirit, the message through song, go and teach the people through your singing.&nbsp; Share the messages of inspiration, goodness and peace.&nbsp; I know that hearts and lives changed because Merrilee influenced her students to aspire to greater heights spiritually.&nbsp; I was changed for good and count her as one of the true spiritual giants in my life.&nbsp; I took Sister Webb’s class every semester for the three short years she taught at BYU-Hawaii.&nbsp; During that time both choirs grew to over 100 students enrolled every semester.&nbsp; Merrilee was also selected by students as Teacher of the Year by students two of the three years she taught at BYU-Hawaii.&nbsp; It would have been three years but the rules would not allow the same teacher to be awarded in consecutive years.&nbsp; The awards of man cannot be compared to pleasing the Lord by serving his children in exact obedience and humility as the Savior did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson says “You make the gospel of Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and, indeed, the very core of what you are.”&nbsp; Sister Webb exemplified this belief by the way she lived.&nbsp; She inspired others by who she is. Her example reminds me of this scripture&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 3 Nephi 12:14-16 it says,&nbsp;</p>
<p>14 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</p>
<p>15 Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house;</p>
<p>16 Therefore, let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven."</p>
<p>I truly believe that like Sister Webb, Aunty Eloise, Aunty Bea, Sister Poliahu and My Mom, Bea Miller we need to be the extension of the light of Christ.&nbsp; We have that tremendous opportunity and calling.&nbsp; We can increase that light when we choose correctly what beliefs we tie ourselves too.&nbsp; We need to understand why need to be tied to those beliefs.and we press forward and share that understanding through testimony and the life we live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the follow up question to that is it connects us to:</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>our purpose&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>our priorities in life</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>our loyalties and allegiance&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>our values&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>who and what we trust or care about&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what motivates us&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what covenants are important to us and ultimately it identifies who we truly are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This realization is important because if used correctly it empowers us to make the choices that will draw us ever closer to Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We then choose to align our hearts, minds, souls and actions with our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost instead of the world’s way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>We make decisions on which foundational stakes in our lives need our attention, strengthening and developing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What do I believe?</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What is my purpose here on earth?</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What journey/path am I to take here on earth?</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What covenants and promises am I committed to honoring?</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Who are my spiritual leaders and mentors?</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Am I the right kind of spiritual partner to my family &amp; friends that they need?</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Are my priorities aligned with the Lord?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my purposes today was to share examples of the individuals that have influenced my life for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They are spiritually strong individuals that provided goodness, care, love and mentorship at my time of need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>They, like me made mistakes, but we look to the word of God, his chosen prophets and authorized leaders for direction and inspired counsel so we can repent, make changes and return to the path of righteousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us joyfully follow the Savior and live the Gospel the best we can.</p>
<p>President Monson’s 3 Ds phrase gives great direction:&nbsp; Decisions Determine Destiny</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest and invite you to decide what you need to tie yourself to by:</p>
<p>1- Listing the things you are tied to.</p>
<p>2- Then Assess and Evaluate what you are tied to by determining which of your list items you need to Nurture or to Negate</p>
<p>3- Create a simple plan that will work for you. One that you can track simply or with a timeline,</p>
<p>4- Implement one day a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see and feel your heart and spirit change. Those changes draw us closer to our elder brother, Jesus Christ so we can be purified like him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Yoshihiko Kikuchi said, "Our Redeemer’s compassionate act will purify us under only one condition. That is we must love Him. We must serve Him. We must offer our absolute commitment to Him. We must follow Him obediently with all of our might, mind, and strength."</p>
<p>We must tie ourselves to him.</p>
<p>In closing, may I share my testimony. I thank Heavenly Father for all my blessings, which includes my gratitude for my eternal sweetheart, my children and grandchildren for always loving and supporting me.&nbsp; I’m grateful for every individual and experience in my life that has helped me learn, live and love the gospel.</p>
<p>It is my testimony that we (all of us) chose to be here and stand as His witness. We need to give our all, it takes hard work, much sacrifice on our part, and then He will make up the difference. May we come to God, the Eternal Father in humility for guidance. May we tie ourselves to the light of Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.df</p>

<p>Aloha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months ago my wife Belinda and I along with our daughter Ashley, visited a ward in Kaneohe to help fellowship a recent convert named Wendy.&nbsp; Wendy had moved to Kaneohe right after she was baptized, so she didn’t know anyone in her new Ward so we and a few others thought it would be nice to attend with her.&nbsp; It was a great visit, and good to see that our dear friend was in good hands with the amazing members of that ward.&nbsp; In between meetings and after church, we had the opportunity to speak twice with Bishop Chun, Wendy’s new Bishop.&nbsp; &nbsp;At one point after observing my wife interact with members of his ward and while showcasing her enthusiasm for the gospel and for life in general, (anyone who knows my wife is familiar with her infectious and distinct chuckle), Bishop Chun turned to me and made an interesting comment.&nbsp; He said “Bro. Duke, you married up didn’t you?”&nbsp; It was way too obvious and I whole-heartedly agreed.&nbsp; He then surprisingly proceeded to counsel directly with my daughter Ashley.&nbsp; Imagine, we were in a small group, but he turns and is focused specifically on her, and he asks, “Ashley, what is one of the most important factors that determines our QOL?&nbsp; Well, it took a little while, but with some help she figured out he was asking about “Quality of Life”, or in general our happiness in this life.</p>
<p>Here was a wise Bishop, taking advantage of a teachable moment and most likely being prompted by the Spirit, to teach my daughter an important point.&nbsp; The message to her that day, twice in fact, was that the decision she makes in whom she marries will have a huge impact on her quality of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;He encouraged her to “marry up”, not hurry up!&nbsp; Naturally, as her parents, we certainly hope she is in tune with the Spirit to know whom that worthy young man will be when the time comes (like maybe in ten years).&nbsp; Parents . . . , we never really want to see our kids grow up.</p>
<p>As for myself, I can tell you I wrestled mightily with the Lord for an answer as to whether I should marry Belinda.&nbsp; As wonderful as she was (and still is), I simply wasn’t willing to take that step without a confirmation from the Lord.&nbsp; It took considerable effort and many attempts to finally get the confirmation.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if there is a thin line between inspiration and desperation.&nbsp; (For those of you serving in Bishoprics who extend callings, you know what I mean don’t you?)&nbsp; Sometimes the Lord really makes us work for an answer.&nbsp; In pursuing a confirmation whether to marry my wife, I’m eternally grateful that I didn’t give up; it truly was worth the time, effort, and patience.</p>
<p>There are times in our life when those promptings come from the Lord in a flash and totally unexpected.&nbsp; Recognizing them, and taking action, can also have a huge impact on our lives and often the lives of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife mentioned earlier that I attended Rick’s College.&nbsp; The experiences I had there were incredible in helping me prepare to serve a mission.&nbsp; During a holiday weekend, I went home to finish filling out my missionary paperwork.&nbsp; I recall vividly the day I was sitting at the kitchen table doing it.&nbsp; There is a question that asks what date you will be available to serve.&nbsp; June 30th was the date I had always firmly anticipated putting down.&nbsp; But as I went to write June 30th, I got a very distinct feeling that I needed to change it.&nbsp; I couldn’t get over the feeling, and I mentioned it to my Mother, and she suggested that I ponder and pray about it.&nbsp; I got the impression of one of my college roommates in my mind; his name is Brad Winn.&nbsp; As I thought about Brad, I remembered that he already had his mission call and was going into the MTC on June 17th.&nbsp; The thought came to me that if I put down June 15th and I happened to get my call around the same time, we might be able to see each other at the MTC.&nbsp; Well the more I thought about it, it just felt right, so I changed my availability date to two weeks earlier and wrote down June 15th.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how important it was that I listened to the Spirit that day, and that I took action.&nbsp; Sometimes even small decisions we make during our life journey, can be a like a major fork in the road, or a major turning point.&nbsp; For me, this was one of them.&nbsp; I did get my call to enter the MTC on June 17th.&nbsp; What is significant about that date is that only four Elders were being called each year to the Cook Islands.&nbsp; The Lord wanted me to serve there, and if I had not changed that date, I would have served somewhere else.&nbsp; My wife previously mentioned that it was on my mission that I learned about BYU Hawaii and was prompted to come here.&nbsp; And this is where I met her, and we’ve been blessed to be able to raise our family here with so many wonderful people, and so many wonderful experiences.&nbsp; For better or worse, I probably would have had a very different life if I had not changed that date.&nbsp; So I’ve learned that good things happen when we follow the Spirit!</p>
<p>If not already, there will come significant moments in your life when you will absolutely need or want an answer to prayer.&nbsp; In addition, we all have the opportunity to receive personal revelation even on a daily basis to help us navigate through the challenges and uncertainties of life.</p>
<p>Likewise, there may be times when the Lord is trying to get a message to us, but for various reasons, we may not be in a position to hear or feel those promptings.</p>
<p>How can we actively and regularly seek direction from the Lord to be able to align our will with His?&nbsp; How then can we best prepare ourselves spiritually to be receptive to those promptings?</p>
<p>The older I get, the more convinced I am that merely by doing the small and simple things consistently and on a regular basis, puts us in a better position to be blessed with the Spirit.&nbsp; Things like, daily scripture study (specifically the Book of Mormon), meaningful personal prayer, and keeping our baptismal covenants, which we are reminded of each week as we listen to the Sacrament prayers to “take upon ourselves his name, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments.”&nbsp; Doing these things regularly provides an excellent foundation for us to be receptive to the Spirit.</p>
<p>We are also taught that to prepare to receive revelation, we should also be reverent and humble, partake of the sacrament worthily, take time to ponder, and be patient, as we seek God’s will. [1]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of us fall a little short on establishing these as habits or continuously striving to develop Christ-like attributes.&nbsp; Sometimes we are even oblivious to what our shortcomings and imperfections are.&nbsp; We are often consumed by our busy lives, or distracted by activities and pursuits that perhaps don’t leave time for spiritual growth.&nbsp; Our testimony however, is a living thing that needs to be fed, nourished, and nurtured or it will gradually die.</p>
<p>When was the last time you called “time out” and found a quiet place to simply ponder about the Savior, your personal development, or spiritual growth?&nbsp; How often do we strive to think about the Savior throughout each day?</p>
<p>Elder Jeffery Holland was asked the question “If the Savior is to become our Exemplar, . . . how [do] we go beyond knowing about him, and really come to know Him.” He replied by quoting King Benjamin in Mosiah 5:13.&nbsp; [SLIDE 1]&nbsp; “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” [2] Elder Holland then answered by saying, “Is the Savior too much of a stranger to us?&nbsp; Is He too far from the thoughts of our hearts?&nbsp; . . . there is something about a prayer in our heart or an attitude or affection in our heart that can be more constant for us than it presently is. . . . We’re supposed to remember Him always.&nbsp; And we’ll have to find a way to do that.&nbsp; . . .that would be a first step.” [3]</p>
<p>If we were able to master that, imagine the impact it would have in counter-acting all of the negative characteristics of the “natural man” that may be within us.&nbsp; Think of some of those, like pride, jealousy, anger, lust, rudeness, greed.&nbsp; If our hearts and minds are always focused on the Savior, it nullifies these tendencies.&nbsp; It’s important that we work on overcoming these on a regular basis.&nbsp; We are reminded by Robert L. Millet, Dean of Religious Studies at BYU and author, that we should not become complacent.</p>
<p>[SLIDE 2]</p>
<p>“Members of the Church who refuse to climb toward greater spiritual heights, who have no inclination to further anchor themselves in the truth, who have become satisfied with their present spiritual state-these are they who are natural men and women, persons generally of good will who do not understand that through their smugness and complacency they are aiding and abetting the cause of the enemy of all righteousness.” [4]</p>
<p>It behooves us to constantly be looking for that next step that we need to take in our journey to become more like the Savior.&nbsp; I’d like to share with you two resources that I think can really help us do that.</p>
<p>If you want to have some fun, find a copy of Preach my Gospel.&nbsp; In chapter six, there is what is called an attribute activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[SLIDE 3] [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a personal self-assessment worksheet that you can use to rate your spiritual growth.&nbsp; There are fifty-seven statements organized into the categories of faith, hope, charity &amp; love, virtue, knowledge, patience, humility, diligence, and obedience.&nbsp; After you’ve rated yourself, it’s so helpful because it identifies your strengths and your weak spots. You can then select the attributes that you want to improve on.&nbsp; I tend to choose the ones I’ve rated myself the lowest.&nbsp; Trust me, I have plenty to choose from.&nbsp; It can be a little discouraging sometimes, when we see where we fall short.&nbsp; But it’s important to remember that it’s a lifelong process, and we move forward day by day, step by step, doing the best we can.</p>
<p>Elder Holland gave a nice talk during this last General Conference titled “Be Ye Therefore Perfect – Eventually”.&nbsp; He emphasized that if we are striving to improve, we are on the right path and we shouldn’t get discouraged.&nbsp; He said “I would hope that we could pursue personal improvement in a way that doesn’t include getting ulcers or anorexia, feeling depressed or demolishing our self-esteem.&nbsp; . . . so while in mortality let’s strive for steady improvement without obsessing over what behavioral scientists call ‘toxic perfectionism.’” [6] It’s a very comforting talk for anyone who may be feeling overwhelmed in our journey to be like our Savior.</p>
<p>Moroni too was comforted by the Savior after he expressed a perceived weakness in his writing ability. In Ether 12:27 the Savior tells us [SLIDE 4]&nbsp; “And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.” [7]</p>
<p>This is such a powerful scripture; it truly empowers us by knowing we can turn our shortcomings into strengths.&nbsp; Make no mistake, it takes a great deal of courage to seek out, identify, and acknowledge our weaknesses.&nbsp; Pride, rationalization, and sometimes even laziness often get in the way.&nbsp; Even if we know or discover our weaknesses, by nature we are incredibly resistant to change.&nbsp; Change is often difficult.&nbsp; It takes time, and effort.&nbsp; We like to stay in our comfort zones don’t we?&nbsp; The adversary likes that too.&nbsp; What we have to remember is that the more we become like our Savior, and put off the natural man, the happier we are.</p>
<p>I’d like to share one additional resource available right here at BYU Hawaii that can help you in your journey to become more like the Savior.&nbsp; At the request of the Church Human Resources Committee, the Leadership Pattern was created in 2010.&nbsp; That committee includes members of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presidency of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric.&nbsp; The guiding question they asked was “What kind of leadership is needed for the future?”&nbsp; President Henry B. Eyring described the Leadership Pattern as “a framework of talents and associated behaviors to help us do the Lord’s work in the Lord’s way.” [8]</p>
<p>[SLIDE 5]</p>
<p>There are nine total talents.&nbsp; Six of those are operational talents that include skills you would find promoted and encouraged in any corporate or business environment.</p>
<p>The talents and their associated behaviors are applicable to each of us.&nbsp; Although the Leadership Pattern was developed for the Church workforce, the principles taught in it are extremely valid for personal growth.&nbsp; They also align perfectly with the mission of Brigham Young University–Hawaii, which is “to integrate both spiritual and secular learning and to prepare students with character and integrity who can provide leadership in their families, their communities, their chosen fields, and in building the kingdom of God.”[9]</p>
<p>Each of the talents have behaviors and skills associated with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the behaviors of the six operational talents are as follows.</p>
<p>Define Direction – goal setting, creating vision, and anticipating the needs of others.</p>
<p>Counsel Together – inviting input from others, speaking up, being receptive to feedback.</p>
<p>Build Capability – leading others to be better than they know they could become; developing new talents; and achieving greater results.</p>
<p>Organize the Work – planning, prioritizing, using the right processes, tools, and accountabilities.</p>
<p>Accomplish the Work – leading meaningful change, taking the initiative to act, and identifying solutions to challenges.</p>
<p>Render an Account – promoting accountability, personal development, and stewardship.</p>
<p>As you see, these are some incredible attributes and skills that each of us can utilize in many different facets of our lives.&nbsp; The Brethren have taken these six operational talents and added three core talents that can be used to help us to grow even further.&nbsp; These three are more directly related to helping us become more like our Savior, and building up the kingdom.&nbsp; They are, Lead Like the Savior, Act Under the Direction of the Spirit, and Align with the Brethren.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rather than describe the behaviors associated with these, I’d like to share a couple of video clips.</p>
<p>In the first, Elder Bednar explains very eloquently how we can utilize these nine talents and the teachings of the Leadership Pattern in our lives and in our work.</p>
<p>[video 1 - Learning Journey Overview] [10]</p>
<p>I’d like to give you a little more insight into what the Leadership Pattern offers by diving a little deeper into one of the nine talents.&nbsp; The following video clip highlights the talent of “Leading Like the Savior”.</p>
<p>[video 2 – Core Talent: Lead Like the Savior] [11]</p>
<p>If those videos happened to look familiar to you, Brother Benson L. Porter shared them in his devotional talk here at BYUH on September 29, 2015.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about these Leadership Pattern talents and behaviors, the five basic classes are offered right here on campus [SLIDE 6]&nbsp;</p>
<p>by Elder &amp; Sister Andersen and Jana McQueen.&nbsp; The Administration has provided resources and a training room for this instruction.&nbsp; These classes are available to all students, faculty, and staff.&nbsp; [SLIDE 7]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information is shared in a fun and informative manner, and includes many inspiring video clips of the Brethren similar to what you have seen here today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each participant receives a workbook that describes the talents and behaviors and how we can incorporate them into our lives and work.&nbsp; It is a wonderful opportunity to tap into some really great content!</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson describes the Leadership Pattern as “a very good way of defining what kind of people we want to be. …[It provides] direction that keeps us aligned with the Lord, keeps us moving in the pathway of developing His character in us and accomplishing His purposes in all aspects of our life.” [12]</p>
<p>You’ve most likely seen information about these classes listed in the Bulletin or the Student Bulletin.&nbsp; They are offered on a regular basis and I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity.&nbsp; Students, learning about these talents will help you to be a better student, a better person, a better leader, and to be in a better position to develop a more successful career.</p>
<p>In addition to the five basic classes, there are over two dozen Leadership Enrichment Series available for work groups here on campus.&nbsp; Each is a 90-minute presentation that goes into greater detail and instruction on a particular talent.</p>
<p>These are held in a casual setting with a general authority, and include a question and answer period with audience members.&nbsp; Some of the best teaching moments come from the response to a question.&nbsp; The very candid and frank answers are insightful and enriching.&nbsp; I’ve had the opportunity to either watch the video or read the narrative on twelve of them, and every single one has been incredibly inspiring. I keep waiting for a dud; it just hasn’t happened, they are all just so good.&nbsp; For me, it’s been like drinking from a fire hose, there is so much great content.</p>
<p>For those of you who are managers, directors, deans, etc, you might be wondering how you could utilize this Leadership Pattern material in your training programs to enrich and strengthen the employees in your department.&nbsp; I invite you to contact Elder &amp; Sister Andersen to learn more.</p>
<p>In one of the Leadership Enrichment Series, Brother Ben Porter from Church Human Resources asked Elder Bednar the following, “My question to you is that occasionally we’ll hear . . .people who are in the role of managing people will make the comment, ‘I don’t have the time to do that, to develop my people.’&nbsp; ‘It’s not a priority for me or for the organization.’ Or, ‘it’s not my responsibility; it’s some other department’s responsibility for doing that.’&nbsp; How would you respond to that, and what counsel would you give . . . ?”</p>
<p>Elder Bednar shaking his head responded, “I cannot comprehend in my mind someone in any kind of management or leadership position who says, ‘Developing people is not my job.’&nbsp; I do not understand that mentality.&nbsp; And I do not think a person with that mind-set truly grasps leadership.&nbsp; If we are involved in leadership like the Savior, what did He do?&nbsp; Everything He did developed, lifted, and helped other people.” [14]</p>
<p>For those who have been here at the University as long as I have, you know we’ve seen different training programs come and go through the years.&nbsp; The Leadership Pattern is very different.&nbsp; The Church has had this in place for nearly eight years now, and it just keeps getting better and better.&nbsp; As we adopt this, it has huge staying power.</p>
<p>I’d like to share one final video clip that shows how the Leadership Pattern can help us change as we apply these leadership talents as we interact with others, specifically as leaders and mentors.&nbsp; This one is a little closer to home.</p>
<p>[video 3 – Dan Pollister – Laie Temple] [15]</p>
<p>I love the three thought-provoking questions encouraged by the Leadership Pattern that can help us to become more like our Savior.&nbsp; What lack I yet?&nbsp; What must I do?&nbsp; And, therefore, what?</p>
<p>Today I‘ve shared with you two tools that can be used to help each of us assess what Elder Bednar refers to as “the gap” between the person we are today, and the person we can become, one who emulates the Savior.&nbsp; The attribute survey in Preach My Gospel and the Leadership Pattern can have a significant impact in our lives, if we take advantage of the occasion to use them.&nbsp; Opportunities abound that can help us take that next step in our journey to become more like our Savior and to have His Spirit to be with us.&nbsp; I pray that if the Spirit has prompted you today to take some form of action, that you will find the courage to act.&nbsp; And if by chance you currently don’t have a desire to discover your weaknesses or to work on them, may you ask in humble prayer, that you will be blessed with that desire.&nbsp; It is my testimony that He lives, and He knows and loves each of us personally.&nbsp; He is waiting, with open arms, to help us in this journey, to return and live with Him.&nbsp; May He bless you as you strive to take that next step, whatever it may be.&nbsp; I say these things, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anything is Possible</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Mahana, The Beautiful.&nbsp; You know, I built the sets for the movie Johnny Lingo, I even built the canoe used at the beginning.&nbsp; David Jacob, a good friend of ours, was with the filming crew at the set of Johnny Lingo.&nbsp; He walked over while I was talking with the director and asked me, “How is Mahana?”&nbsp; The director heard the name and said to David, “That’s the name we want to use for the leading girl.”&nbsp; The director asked me if they could use her name and I said, “yes,” for my wife.&nbsp; Mahana means sunshine and she is worth more than the eight cows that Johnny Lingo gave her father.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ALOHA and Malo e lelei! Today I will share a few examples from my life that teach us that “Anything is Possible.”&nbsp; I will base my remarks on these two scriptures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Luke 18:27 it says, "…The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."</p>
<p>In Mark 14:34-36 it says,</p>
<p>"34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p>
<p>35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p>
<p>36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A simple prayer</strong></p>
<p>Let me begin my story with an answer to simple prayer. In December 1959, I was released as a labor missionary in Tonga and went home to my island of Pangai to be with my family.&nbsp; My parents were on a mission at the time at the big island.&nbsp; While there, I heard the news that the Church called 25 building missionaries to go to Hawaii to build the Polynesian Cultural Center.&nbsp; Oh how I wanted to be one of them.&nbsp; But I was not.&nbsp; There were only two of them called from my island.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately after I heard the news, I went to my room and knelt in prayer, very simply, I said, “Heavenly Father, please send me to Hawaii as a missionary if thou seest that I can be of help.”&nbsp; With all my heart I asked, and I said Amen.&nbsp; &nbsp;During this week President Mendenhall, the chairman of the Church building committee, traveled to New Zealand to call Maori building missionaries to the project in Hawaii. In that meeting, he called 12 Maori men to go to Hawaii. In his talk he announced, “I have called 30 Tongan missionaries to go to Hawaii.”&nbsp; At the end of the meeting my former supervisor from the mission, who was there with him, walked up to President Mendenhall and said, “In your talk you said you called 30 missionaries in Tonga, but you called only 25.”&nbsp; President Mendenhall told him, “when you go back to Tonga, tell the mission president to call 5 more.” And I was one of those 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that right from that moment, what seemed impossible became possible through God.&nbsp; He answered my simple prayer and through His will I was able to help and play a very big part in that mission in Hawaii. I served three years and nine months.&nbsp; I operated all of our heavy equipment and mixed all of the cement for not just the PCC, but all the projects we completed at the time including the additional dorms for the CCH (Hales 3 to 6), basement and two wings on the Hawaiian temple, housing for the temple President and temple workers, housing for faculty on Moana street, the Laie Stake Center and Hau’ula Makai Chapel, and the temple visitor’s center.&nbsp; All these additional projects were completed before we started work on the PCC.&nbsp; When President Tanner told us that BYU-Hawaii saved a lot of money by not having to break down the old dorms because they were strong enough to build another floor on, I was very happy because I mixed that concrete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A brief history of the Church building missionary program</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who never heard of it, the idea for the building missionary program started in Tonga when the Church leased some land to build Liahona High School in 1947.&nbsp; The mission president asked the priesthood brethren to come to Liahona to help clean up the land to make room for the buildings.&nbsp; Since there was no heavy machinery there at the time, all the work had to be done by hand.&nbsp; I remember when my father sailed on a boat to Tongatapu to volunteer at the Liahona clearing project.&nbsp; He went there a few times to spend a month at a time working on cleaning up the site.&nbsp; The Church leaders saw this and started the Church Building Program.&nbsp; President David O. McKay called President Wendell Mendenhall to chair the Church Building committee and he called supervisors from the mainland who were sent down to Tonga, Samoa and New Zealand to build the schools and chapels, and train local builders.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>President Mendenhall told us that the Church was able to save a lot of money because of the building missionary program.&nbsp; This allowed the Church to build many chapels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A short history of missionary service in my family</strong></p>
<p>My parents converted to the Church with their seven children at the time. Later there were six more of us who were born into the Church, and I was number 13, the youngest of 7 boys, and blessed to be born into the Church. My dad was the branch president for many years and later my parents were called on a mission.&nbsp; While my parents were on their mission, a brother and his wife were also on a proselyting mission, and I had two brothers and a sister and her husband and I who were called to the Church Building Missionary Program.&nbsp; So, there were 5 of us children and our parents on a mission at the same time.&nbsp; How were we able to support ourselves?&nbsp; I don’t know, but I do know the Lord made it possible for us to accomplish.&nbsp; We did it the Lord’s way.&nbsp; And He took care of everything.&nbsp; I remember I had only two work pants and two work shirts and one shirt and one lavalava for church.&nbsp; I had to do washing during the week so I could wear clean clothes. There was no one to support us because our parents were on a mission at the same time.&nbsp; But I never had to stop going to work or to church because there were no clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ten dollars</strong></p>
<p>When leaving Tonga for Hawaii in March 1960, my parents were still on their mission in Tongatapu.&nbsp; During this time in Tonga, members of the Church would sell everything they owned in order to earn the fare to go to New Zealand to attend the temple and receive temple ordinances.&nbsp; I knew my parents wouldn’t be able to go because they did not have enough money.&nbsp; So I made myself a promise - if I find some money in Hawaii, I will save it to send my parents to the temple.&nbsp; When we got to Hawaii we found that the Church took good care of us.&nbsp; They provided everything we needed, plus we were given ten dollars in cash every month so we could buy soda, ice cream, and go to the movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I received my first $10, I remembered the promise I made.&nbsp; So I took it to Lola, my supervisor’s wife, and asked her to please make me a savings account and put this ten dollars in it, and told her what it was for.&nbsp; She helped me do that and also offered to donate an additional $10 a month to my account if I would come and clean their yard.&nbsp; Her neighbor found out what I was doing and offered to donate $10 to my account for cleaning her yard.&nbsp; There were others who also donated.&nbsp; By the summer of 1962, I collected enough money to send my parents to New Zealand to the temple.&nbsp; One of my brother’s wrote me a letter and said, it may seem that you love our parents more than we do, but that is just because you were in the position to help them to go to the temple, but we love them just the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Watermelon - Who likes watermelon? I love watermelon.</strong></p>
<p>I had other goals that would require even more money and the help of the Lord.&nbsp; I wanted to marry Mahana, and I wanted to return to Tonga after the labor mission and then come back to school at CCH in Laie.&nbsp; The Lord provided a way for me to accomplish my goals because I did not have the means as a labor missionary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 1963 I went to an old Hawaiian man who grew watermelons next door to the labor missionaries, and asked him if he could help me plant some watermelons.&nbsp; He said yes.&nbsp; So I took a machine to a piece of land that used to be planted with sugar cane next to the PCC site.&nbsp; I cleared the land and prepared the ground and the man helped me plant the watermelon seeds there.&nbsp; That year there was a big flood in Laie and it washed away my watermelon field that had just started to grow.&nbsp; After the flooding cleared, I went back to the old man for help, I got the machine again and plowed the land and planted more watermelon.&nbsp; This time it grew nicely and bore a lot of melons.&nbsp; When the melon crop was ready, the old man told me to pick the melon and go and sell it at the village.&nbsp; I used a jeep that I used at work and loaded it with watermelon after work.&nbsp; I drove it to the village and sold it for 10 cents a pound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of the season I earned a little over $700 for selling watermelon on the side.&nbsp; So I took the money to the old man and told him this is the money I got from selling melon.&nbsp; He said, you keep the money and at the end of the picking for the field you grew, I will see if there is more money to give you.&nbsp; I said, “No” this is enough for me.&nbsp; I took some of the money and bought an engagement ring for my wife-to-be.&nbsp; I took her out on her birthday, October 19, 1963, this was during the week of the PCC dedication, and proposed to her and gave her the ring. With the remaining money I bought a return trip ticket from Tonga so I could return back to school.&nbsp; This was the reason why I wanted to plant the watermelon, so I could get money to buy my return ticket so I could come back to school at CCH.&nbsp; I went home after being released from my mission in December 1963.&nbsp; I gave the rest of the money to my mom and then returned to attend CCH in February 1964.&nbsp; We were married in June 1964 and have now been married 53 years.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>These two stories, the $10 and the watermelon, show that with God, a penniless young man from Tonga can gather enough money to help do His will in sending his parents to the temple and finding eternal marriage.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PCC - My best friends for life</strong></p>
<p>The Polynesian Cultural Center was originally planned to be built where the married student housing is now, next to the temple.&nbsp; We prepared the site, got the lagoon in and then got word from Salt Lake that it was too close to the temple and should not be built there.&nbsp; Instead it should be built along Kamehameha Highway.&nbsp; Because I was the heavy equipment operator, I took the bulldozer down and cleared the land at the highway.&nbsp; After the land was ready we started building the PCC in 1962.&nbsp; We got all the materials for the huts and started to build the villages.&nbsp; When we were building the Tongan village, we Tongan labor missionaries were somehow not happy with what we saw we were doing, it did not seem right.&nbsp; So we decided, six weeks before the dedication, that we would build a REAL Tongan fale, which is called the Queen’s house today.&nbsp; We brought in two men from Tonga who were experts in Tongan structures and went to work.&nbsp; Our supervisors told us that we would have to do this on our own time because we still had a lot of work to do on other parts of the Center.&nbsp; So we would work until quitting time at 3:30PM and then after that work on the Queen’s house on our own time, later into the evening.&nbsp; We sent someone to Tonga to ask the Queen for materials to decorate the house.&nbsp; The Queen gave us a lot of tapa and mats to use in the interior of the building.&nbsp; We finished it right before the dedication of PCC was to take place and we were happy that we did that for the Tongan village.&nbsp; Anything is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so grateful for PCC because it was PCC that gave me the opportunity to come to Hawaii and learn and grow and do the things that I know how to do today.&nbsp; I am willing to help PCC at any time to help make it a very successful place so that anyone can enjoy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The ‘Iosepa</strong></p>
<p>One day Uncle Bill Wallace, the first director of the Hawaiian Studies program, came to me and asked if I can build a Hawaiian wa’a kaulua for the Hawaiian studies program.&nbsp; “Yes, I’d loved to do it.&nbsp; When?” I said.&nbsp; Of course it is koa wood that Hawaiians use to make their canoes.&nbsp; I looked into it and Bill also looked into it to try to find the wood, but we couldn’t find someone who could supply a big enough log for a 50 foot double hull canoe.&nbsp; Well, I left for Tonga to build a Tongan, traditional, 100-foot, double hull, sailing canoe which took me a year and a half to complete.&nbsp; When I completed that project, while still in Tonga, Bill called and asked if I could order the same wood that I used in the Tongan canoe, which came from Fiji.&nbsp; I did and came home in December 2000 and the logs arrived in Laie in March 2001.&nbsp; We started on the Iosepa in March and completed it in August of the same year.&nbsp; It took us only six months to complete the project. We invited the community to come out and help and the Hawaiian Studies students came out to help also.&nbsp; &nbsp;People from Laie, and from throughout the island, showed up every day to help out in the work.&nbsp; That is how we got the ‘Iosepa done so soon.&nbsp; David Eskaran and I needed that help and we got it thanks to the spirit of the ‘Iosepa that was there.&nbsp; It was the help and spirit of the community that made it possible to finish the canoe in that short period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>One evening after the ‘Iosepa was completed, I was there by myself. I stepped away from the canoe and took a good look at it and said, “Wow! What a beautiful boat!”&nbsp; And a feeling came over me and I thanked Heavenly Father for helping us to build such a beautiful canoe.&nbsp; For making it possible to accomplish such a great feat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>John Ruskin wrote,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When we build, let us think that we build forever.&nbsp; Let it not be for present delight nor for present use alone.&nbsp; Let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for, and let us think, as we lay stone on stone, that a time is to come when those stones will be held sacred because our hands have touched them, and that men will say as they look upon the labours and wrought substance of them, ‘See! This our Fathers did for us.’”</p>
<p>When I came here to Hawaii, I was just a young restless guy who didn’t know much and did not speak much English.&nbsp; But in the service of God as a building missionary I learned all these things and developed my talents.&nbsp; As with the ‘Iosepa, on many of the projects that I worked on throughout my life, when I completed them and looked at the work I asked myself, “did I actually do that by myself?&nbsp; There’s gotta be somebody else who helped me.”&nbsp; I know that God has helped me accomplish the impossible and He will help you.</p>

What a view to look out at. You are the bright and hopeful future of our church, our families and the world with seas of opportunities ahead of you, threshold and crossroads to select. This morning I want to share my insights, my feelings on “I too, Must Give.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greatest gift endowed upon us is the ultimate atoning sacrifice that the Savior gave which allows us to cleanse and release so we balance ourselves and become whole. The epistle of Mark talked about the giving of the poor widow’s mites.</p>
<p>Though it wasn’t much value by the world standard of wealth. She gave all she had and therefore is numbered amongst those that claim “I too, Must Give” and it was the kind of giving that matters most.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Helaman 15:13 it says:</p>
<p>“they shall be brought to the true knowledge which is the knowledge of their Redeemer and their great and true shepherd and be numbered among his sheep.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Last week, I had the honor of serving her Highness Princess Salote Pilolevu and her entourage. Her Majesty Queen Salote, Princess, Grandmother and Namesake gave her respect to the Queen of England by not putting up her carriage roof during the rain and thereby her island kingdom hit the media. She must have said to herself, I am not here for my royal dignity, I am here to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in her coronation parade. So she contributed by following “I too, Must Give.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Her Son</strong></p>
<p>King George Tupou IV came and invested the Mafifakapotu title upon the President of the Polynesian Cultural Center, then President Lester Moore, and the title has remained with us since then.</p>
<p>King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasi came to the grand opening of the Tongan Village last year and his son Prince Ata is an endowed member today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some years back it was the unthinkable but today his highness the prince is amongst the sheep led by the true shepherd as Helaman prophesied so his influence is felt throughout the Kingdom and especially in the Palace.&nbsp; My point is, along the way many on our campus, the community, the church and the Polynesian Cultural Center said to themselves “I too, Must Give” as we hosted, catered and served them and it has profiteth all of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How about you and I?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>President Thomas Monson commented “we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort and our kindness.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I have a list of simple but valuable things for us to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Give of the self. This is self-explanatory. Where we can all contribute to "I too, Must Give".</p>
<p>2.Thoughtfulness to others who maybe homesick, heartbroken for having received a Dear John, failed an exam, health, and other struggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Consideration of roommates, other cultures and the way they see things. Loud music when one is not feeling well or sleeping early for a test next morning is not a good deposit to "I too, Must Give."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Courage to do what is right&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.Happy with what you have. You must be happy today, not tomorrow. Be happy with your beautiful classrooms, your opportunity to work and pay for your schooling, happy in the gospel, happy that the beach is within walking distance.</p>
<p>6.Tolerance with understanding, esteem our neighbors with respect, your unit-mates, your teachers, co-workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.Gratitude for all your blessings. Don’t wait, let your parents know how much you appreciate them. Let a friend know what they mean to you. Let your Bishop know that his wisdom and counsel means a lot to you. Do it now.</p>
<p>8.Be genuinely happy for others. Robert Louise Stevenson said, “a friend is a present you give yourself."<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>May I share a prophecy that we are so familiar with. “From this campus will men and women whose influence will be felt for good towards the establishment of peace internationally. Missionaries who will influence not thousands not tens of thousands but millions to know what we’re about and Laie’s significance.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Much serving made. Many, many people gave and gave and committed. "I too, Must Give." To you who may feel discouraged and see your upbringing as perhaps not the best circumstances I say, “shake it off” and put your shoulders to the wheel and commit yourself to Give. My mother passed away when I was only one.</p>
<p>All of my siblings took on the parental role and saw to it that I was nurtured, cared for and loved especially my grandma Fifita. They must have said to themselves:</p>
<p>“I too, Must Give”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My college parents are here with us today, my brother Saia and his lovely wife Frances I pay tribute to.</p>
<p>They said to themselves, “I too Must Give” so they supported me, then I told them I was going on a mission and I don’t know how they did it but every month, no fail I received a check from them.&nbsp; My success journey in life is due to the many strong shoulders I stand upon.&nbsp; My sweet and supportive eternal companion, my best friend Livingston Unga. My children and their families are my jewels and to whom I always say “I too, Must Give”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My testimony is I know God lives. He gave and continues to give. Our Savior gave his life. Of us it’s expected that “We too, Must Give” and I share this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, Lesa and I are so grateful to be gathered with you this morning. We feel blessed to be with all of you on this beautiful BYU-Hawaii campus—paradise in Paradise. We have such warm feelings of our time with you in our previous visits to Hawaii. We were also glad to have had some time last week to meet with President and Sister Tanner prior to his departure for an assignment at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am reminded of a time many years ago when I lived here for three months. My memories of this were rekindled yesterday, as we walked by the dormitory where I stayed as a young missionary destined for the Japan Fukuoka Mission, attending what was then called the LTM (or Language Training Mission). My mind and heart were flooded with fond memories and tender emotions recalling some of the struggles and also the joys of learning the Japanese language, as well as the many prayers asking the Lord for help. I believe the walls of those buildings must be sacred, having witnessed so many struggles and miracles and also having heard so many heartfelt prayers over all these years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Sister Stevenson and I were discussing how grateful we are for this assignment to participate in your devotional, it occurred to us that those of you from Asia who are now students at BYU-Hawaii may have been Young Men or Young Women attending EFY when we spoke at those events in your home countries some years ago when we were assigned there while serving in the Asia North Area Presidency. Then, as well as now, we are so impressed with your devotion and desire to <em>choose</em> the right and to <em>do</em> what is right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember those conferences well. You were much younger then! Since then much has taken place in your lives, in fact in <em>all</em> of your lives. High school graduation, temple endowments, missions, military service, and now pursuing higher education. We are proud of each of you for your significant accomplishments and progress in so many of life’s important steps. We note that some of you are now married, and some even with children – congratulations. Others of you are dating, and courting, some very seriously, this is good as well. We encourage you in all these good and important activities in your lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I bring to all of you the warm greetings and love from President Thomas S. Monson, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. They, along with both Lesa and me, want you to know how amazing we think you are! The Lord loves each one of you! You are important! You play such a very important role in the Church here in Laie, Hawaii as students attending BYU-Hawaii. This important role will continue in locations yet unknown as to where you will be when you finish school. You literally are the bright future of the Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a great blessing it is to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ in the dispensation where a restoration of the keys of the Kingdom and the fulfillment of prophecy allow us to witness first hand “the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> This prophecy, originally given by Daniel of the Old Testament, and subsequently repeated in this dispensation seems to be in the midst of its fulfillment as we observe over 3,250 organized stakes in the Church today. This is especially noteworthy when I consider that when our beloved President Monson was ordained an apostle in 1963, the number of stakes worldwide was only 389.<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> Isn’t that remarkable! During this same timeframe of President Monson’s apostolic ministry, membership in the Church has grown from 2.1 million to 15.8 million.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As impressive to me as is this prolific growth and change, are the principles and practices that remain the same, including the divine governance model revealed for the Church of Jesus Christ. This model allows the organization of stakes, designed to “provide a defense and a refuge from the storm and from wrath poured . . . out upon the whole earth.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> Of course, within stakes, are wards and branches, and the general officers of such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leads to my first point of emphasis today, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enjoy the Blessings of a Bishop</span>. Every member of the Church has a bishop (in the case of branches, a branch president). Such has been the case from the earliest days of the Church. A bishop’s ordination and call are approved and sustained by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, on an individual basis. They are recommended to the First Presidency by prayerful inspiration and revelation. Take a moment to think of your bishop. Each of your bishops are instructed to minister to you, helping you become a faithful follower of Jesus Christ. Ministering to you means they will remember your name and become acquainted with you, they will love without judging you, watch over and strengthen your faith, even as the Savior did, and establish a sincere friendship and visit with you.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy these blessings of a bishop! Now as you can imagine, the role of a bishop (which I have just described) is a heavy one. You can help him. As students, who are often moving from one ward to another, may I recommend that you introduce yourself to your new bishop at the beginning of the school year or semester. You should always know who your bishop is and do what you can to assure he knows <em>you</em> and <em>your name</em>. The best way to do this is to attend your meetings regularly and to serve where you are called. I promise you that much good will come of this practice. The Lord loves you, and will minister to you <em>through</em> your bishop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you are recipients of beautiful promises which have been given to you from the Lord including; “Behold I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, the Lord is generous in the blessings that He grants to us. Understanding that blessings are a function of our obedience to commandments, and keeping commandments is a demonstration of our love of the Lord are valuable precepts to learn. Gospel principles such as these provide a very important perspective for us.</p>
<p>This leads to the next two points which I would like to emphasize. I note that these two points have been previously shared by Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Twelve to some YSA in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Point number two, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintain a Gospel Perspective</span>.</p>
<p>Elder Oaks said that “perspective means to see all the facts in a meaningful relationship, the whole view.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup> Here are some examples of a gospel perspective:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Maintain a Gospel Perspective</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 150px;"><strong>One:</strong> You are children of a loving Heavenly Father.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 150px;"><strong>Two:</strong> You are here on earth for a purpose, allowing choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 150px;"><strong>Three:</strong> “There must needs be an opposition in all things.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 150px;"><strong>Four:</strong> Jesus Christ is our Savior and advocate with the Father.</p>
<p>Consider what happens if your gospel perspective becomes the lens that you look through in every aspect of your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have this ‘gospel perspective,’ it will give you greater clarity as to the way you think about your life priorities, solve problems, as well as face your personal temptations. This can truly affect your overall approach to your entire life and the various decisions you will make along the way.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how having a gospel perspective can be helpful to you. With this outlook, we know that the Lord desires that we partake of the sacrament each week and that we study the scriptures and pray to Him daily. In addition, we know that Satan will tempt us not to follow our Savior or listen to the Holy Ghost’s quiet promptings. We can then be more aware that the adversary strives to take away our agency and ability to withstand his efforts, through addiction, including drugs and pornography. In stark contrast, the lens of the gospel gives us a clear vision of the importance of creating families, choosing to marry, and raising children in righteousness. This view also opens our eyes us to see that the adversary would like to destroy the family unit altogether and confuse gender roles, thus making society decrease in relation to the formation and building of families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having discussed our first point, <em>Enjoy the Blessings of a Bishop</em>, and now point number two, <em>Maintain a Gospel Perspective</em>, let's now move to our next topic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintain a Spiritual Balance</span>. Elder Oaks has stated, &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>"When young adults have the perspective, the overall view . . . it is vital for them to maintain spiritual balance in their lives. To do this you must abstain from some of the attractions of the world and also to do the things necessary to draw closer to the Savior.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>As you study this slide, consider how…on the one hand, you have so many pressing issues and life priorities of all sizes and varieties, of one type or another, all needing attention, focus, and direction. The list for each of you may be quite different, based upon your personal circumstances, but within them you will certainly find: education, employment, marriage, and both emotional and physical wellness. Of course, your challenge is to balance these important life roles against your spirituality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be very careful as you allocate your time that you don't starve yourself spiritually while you keep focus on all your other life pursuits and responsibilities. This principle explains why it is especially important for university and college students to follow the counsel to attend Church meetings, have daily prayer and scripture study, and serve in Church callings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the midst of your very personal and diverse needs, to balance life's pursuits and challenges along with your spirituality, you will come to realize that <em>balance is achievable</em>. The Lord does not require you to do something that you cannot accomplish. I have heard President Monson on numerous occasions counsel that ‘the Lord qualifies those whom He calls.’ &nbsp;I think this especially applies to each of you, in your role as members of His Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, as daunting as keeping this balance may seem, let me promise you, one of the greatest miracles of your mortal existence, given your appropriate focus and effort will be your ability to find balance between your spirituality and your other important life roles. This will take place in a way that will not just maintain your spirituality and life’s important roles at status quo, but will allow you to grow and develop in both of these very important areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason this is possible is because the Lord is the fulcrum. He is the absolute center point of balance. And He has divine interest in each one of you personally as one of His children. Please note that this outcome is predicated on your appropriate focus and effort to find balance.</p>
<p>From my observation and personal experience, it seems that we have a tendency throughout our life to tip more heavily one way or the other. To remain balanced in our lives requires our constant effort and care. Actively choose to stay steady.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it can go both ways. There may be times you find that you need to exercise care to keep clearly focused on your school work, with Church service done in Church service time. However, remember to keep the Lord as your ‘fulcrum’ to find your appropriate spiritual equilibrium.</p>
<p>To summarize, we have now described three important points, <em>Enjoy the Blessings of a Bishop, Maintain a Gospel Perspective, </em>and<em> Maintain a Spiritual Balance</em>.</p>
<p>I would now like to add the fourth, and final point of encouragement, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lord Will Help You</span>. It is quite easy to understand this fundamental truth when we keep a gospel perspective. A most basic gospel principle taught early on – for many as young children and others as they are converted – is that we are children of loving Heavenly Parents. They are glorified when we return to Their presence. It is only natural for Them to help us in every way to return to our Heavenly Home.</p>
<p>Even as I express these words, coupled with a knowledge that Jesus Christ is our advocate with the Father, my faith that <em>The Lord Will Help You</em> just soars!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure that each of you have numerous examples of this principle in your lives, as I do in mine. Today I share an example with you of “how the Lord can help you” that was shared with me many years ago by one of my youth leaders. This man had an enormous personal impact on me growing up and has recently passed away. Thad Carlson was raised in the Great Depression era (in the United States) as the ninth of fourteen children. His family made a living by farming and raising cattle. It was a difficult time financially, and their greatest asset in being able to support their large family was their herd of cattle. In his youth, one of Thad’s responsibilities on the farm was to care for and, when necessary, herd the cattle to assure they found the best feed, a big job for a young boy. He was able to do this with the aid of a smart cow pony who knew exactly what to do with very little direction. The pony was named <em>Old Smoky</em>. Thad described that Old Smoky had one fault – which was that he never wanted to be caught. Whenever this horse was approached to be caught, he would just run away, knowing that he was going to be put to work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this day, after Old Smoky was caught, bridled and saddled, young Thad rode out to the pasture where the cattle were grazing. The ground was dry, and so was the pasture, as the whole area was experiencing a drought. Thad noticed that the grass outside the pasture along the sides of the railroad tracks seemed longer and greener. So, he thought they could herd the cows outside the fenced pasture and let them enjoy some of that good feed which was right along the railroad tracks. With the help of Old Smoky, he herded the cattle out of the pasture, where they began to move back and forth along the rail tracks feeding on the better, greener grass. Everything seemed to be working out so well with this plan. The contented cows seemed to be taking care of themselves, so Thad got off his horse, and sat on the reins of the bridle enjoying the surroundings around him, playing and amusing himself. Old Smoky eventually drifted away, his reins slipping out from under Thad, looking to graze in the green grass himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This idyllic and peaceful moment came to a crashing and abrupt halt when Thad suddenly heard a loud noise from far away. It was the whistle of an oncoming locomotive barreling down the very rail tracks where his cattle herd were lazily scattered right in front of him! He recognized the consequences could be devastating to the herd and also to his family if he did not act quickly to get the cattle back into the pasture away from that oncoming train. He felt he would never be able to forgive himself for not fulfilling his trusted responsibility. He swiftly jumped to his feet and ran to grab the reins of Old Smoky. Old Smoky saw him coming and quickly danced away from Thad – of course not wanting to be caught. Breathless and desperate, with images of dead cows and family tragedy flashing through his mind, Thad knew he had to act fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He later recorded what followed next : “My primary teacher had taught us to pray, and reinforced teachings learned from my mother. With no other recourse, I dropped to my knees and started to pray for help to clear the cows off the tracks.” &nbsp;He continues, “I didn’t hear a voice, but the clear thought came, “Notice how the cows can walk by Old Smoky and he doesn’t move. So . . . now that you are on your knees, also get on your hands. Play [pretend] like you’re a cow and <em>crawl</em> over to Old Smoky.” &nbsp;I did. He didn’t move. I grabbed his reins, led him to the fence, hopped on his back and we raced like the wind to get the cows back into the pasture. Old Smoky was unusually brilliant at every twist and turn.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thad continued to describe that at the time he “didn’t dare tell anyone about this for fear of getting his pants kicked . . .”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also described that it was sometime later, when he was in high school that it fully dawned on him that he had a very clear answer to his prayer in a critical time of need. He observed that, “angels administered to Old Smoky beyond my ability, and our family was spared a tragedy.”</p>
<p>Later on, he shared: “this was the first of many promptings that was to come to me. ‘And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be given unto you.’”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He finally quipped, “whenever someone would sing the song ‘On Top of Old Smoky’, I always thought of prayer.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have our ‘cattle to clear off the railroad tracks before the train arrives.’ They come in many different forms, shapes and sizes. Some are even as serious as Thad’s dangerous situation with consequences that could turn into a family tragedy on many levels, some may be <em>life</em> threatening, and some may even be <em>soul</em> threatening, for you or your loved ones.</p>
<p>Other situations you face may not have such serious consequences, but nevertheless weigh heavily on your mind and heart. One thing is certain, each of you will have adversity and affliction in your lives, because it is part of our mortal experience. But remember, <em>The Lord Will Help You</em>!</p>
<p>I love the words found in the Book of Mormon, which support this precept, “…we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in.” That means each one of you. “Yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth.<a href="#FN11">”<sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;What a great comfort it is to know: <em>The Lord Will Help You</em>.</p>
<p>It looks like our time has come to an end. I have truly enjoyed being with you today. I love you, I honor you and I support you in <em>every way</em>.</p>
<p>Before I close and share my testimony with you, I would like to quickly summarize the thoughts I have discussed with you today. First, I described some of the roles of your bishop and encouraged you to Enjoy the Blessings of a Bishop. To do this, you should reach out to him to make certain he knows <em>you</em> and you know <em>him</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, I described how it is important to Maintain a Gospel Perspective and shared the idea to look at the world around you through the ‘lens’ of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then emphasized the goal to Maintain a Spiritual Balance. We are all faced with challenges and opportunities in our various life roles, and they are best served when we balance them with our faith in Jesus Christ and His atonement, which comprises our spirituality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I shared my faith and hope that The Lord Will Help You. This is what helps you confidently face the challenges that are an inevitable part of your mortal mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would now like to conclude by sharing my testimony of these things which I have spoken today: We have a loving Heavenly Father, and we are His children. I have faith in and a testimony of Jesus Christ and of His role as our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness of the restoration of the gospel; Joseph Smith is the Prophet who presides over this final dispensation, and the Book of Mormon is the word of God. I bear testimony that we are members of the re-established and restored Church of Jesus Christ with priesthood authority and priesthood keys in these latter-days. I bear testimony that the Church is led by a living prophet who receives divine revelation, Thomas S. Monson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I offer these thoughts and my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

<p>[President Tanner]</p>
<p>Thank you Sarah and Lawrence. &nbsp;Sister Tanner and I did not know you were going to perform this musical selection when we chose our message, but the text fits our topic. When I wrote the lyrics, I was inspired by a single line in the Parable of the Prodigal Son: “And when he came unto himself.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> When we sin, we stray from our true selves as sons and daughters of God and live below our privileges, like the Prodigal Son. When we repent, we return to our true selves to enjoy our rightful blessings and privileges as Heavenly Father’s heirs. Today Sister Tanner and I will talk about living up to our privileges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Sister Tanner]</p>
<p>One of my favorite chapters in Daughters in My Kingdom is the last, “Live Up to Your Privilege.” The title comes from an inspiring challenge and glorious promise that Joseph Smith gave to the sisters gathered in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red Brick Store for the first Relief Society meeting. &nbsp;What he said to them also applies to us gathered in this first Devotional assembly:</p>
<p>“If you live up to your privilege, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates. ...If you will be pure, nothing can hinder.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>What does it mean to “live up to your privileges”? &nbsp;And what are your privileges here at BYUH? &nbsp;This is what we will talk about today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DON’T LIVE BENEATH YOUR PRIVILEGES</strong></p>
<p>[President Tanner]</p>
<p>Before we talk about this prophetic charge to “live up to your privilege,” we need to remember that prophets have also often chastised the Church for living below our privileges? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brigham Young said that as Latter-day Saints “we live far beneath our privileges”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> because we fail to seek and receive the guidance he Lord wants to give us in our spiritual and temporal affairs. Elder Neal A. Maxwell made similar comments about the gift of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;He said that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The gift of the Holy Ghost truly is one of the greatest blessings available to members of the Church. …Yet, for different reasons, many of us live far below, or are unaware of, our privileges!”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Sister Tanner]</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is rightly called a gift. &nbsp;At our baptism we are invited to “receive” this gift. &nbsp;Yet for many, the gift is never unwrapped and enjoyed. We live beneath our privilege. &nbsp;The Lord describes our situation in D&amp;C 88:33:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[President Tanner]</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf illustrated the predicament of those who live below their privileges by the story of an unfortunate man who went on a cruise. &nbsp;Unaware that his ticket included all the meals and ship activities, he sat in his room and ate beans and crackers. &nbsp;Here is a Church video that accompanied President Uchtdorf’s talk: <sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p><em>[text of video: There once was a man whose lifelong dream was to board a cruise ship and sail the Mediterranean Sea. He dreamed of walking the streets of Rome, Athens, and Istanbul. He saved every penny until he had enough for his passage. Since money was tight, he brought an extra suitcase filled with cans of beans, boxes of crackers, and bags of powdered lemonade, and that is what he lived on every day.</em></p>
<p><em>He would have loved to take part in the many activities offered on the ship—working out in the gym, playing miniature golf, and swimming in the pool. He envied those who went to movies, shows, and cultural presentations. And, oh, how he yearned for only a taste of the amazing food he saw on the ship—every meal appeared to be a feast! But the man wanted to spend so very little money that he didn’t participate in any of these. He was able to see the cities he had longed to visit, but for the most part of the journey, he stayed in his cabin and ate only his humble food.</em></p>
<p><em>On the last day of the cruise, a crew member asked him which of the farewell parties he would be attending. It was then that the man learned that not only the farewell party but almost everything on board the cruise ship—the food, the entertainment, all the activities—had been included in the price of his ticket. Too late the man realized that he had been living far beneath his privileges.</em></p>
<p><em>We live beneath our privileges when we fail to partake of the feast of happiness, peace, and joy that God grants so bountifully. We can be satisfied with a diminished experience and settle for experiences far below our privileges. Or we can partake of an abundant feast of spiritual opportunity and universal blessings.]</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>Our message to you today is to live up to your privileges. &nbsp;Unwrap the gift of your education here. &nbsp;Feast on the meals provided on the good ship BYUH. Relish the journey as you learn from your classes, wards, teachers, classmates, work experiences, activities, and, above all, the Spirit. &nbsp;Don’t sit by yourself in your room eating dry crackers and canned beans!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVILEGES?</strong></p>
<p>[Sister Tanner</p>
<p>]Now President Tanner and I will talk about some of your privileges. &nbsp;I will go first and then President Tanner will talk about some of our privileges as members of this special community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great privileges we have at BYU Hawaii is participating in a university where we feel the Spirit in abundance. &nbsp;It is the Spirit or the gift of the Holy Ghost that we have already mentioned that helps us in our relationships with one another, that guides us to learn and progress intellectually, and that promotes real communication with our Father in Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it such an important privilege to communicate well? &nbsp;And how can we be better at it?</p>
<p>Let me begin with a difficult personal example that has caused me to contemplate the great blessing and privilege of communication.</p>
<p>Our 2 ½-year-old grandson, Jack, was just diagnosed with a rare genetic deletion. &nbsp;It is called Phelan/McDermid syndrome. &nbsp;Although his case is shown to be on the mild end of the spectrum, he nevertheless, is missing the speech gene on the 22nd chromosome. &nbsp;He is the sweetest, most social little guy, but it is becoming increasingly frustrating to both him and his parents that he cannot talk. &nbsp;He tries so hard to show what he wants or needs, and his parents (and I when I am with him) try to read his eyes, watch all of his body language, and listen to guidance from the Holy Ghost to understand what he is trying to tell us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From Jack I am learning anew what a privilege it is simply to be able to communicate! &nbsp;When one either cannot or does not communicate, anger, resentment, misunderstanding, and frustration abound. &nbsp;We are looking for miracle workers and angels like Helen Keller’s teacher Ann Sullivan, who will help unlock this door of silence for our little Jack. We are learning how crucial talking is to understanding, guiding, and loving one another. &nbsp;May you and I who enjoy the privilege of communication use and develop our communication skills to understand and to bless others.</p>
<p>To truly communicate, we know that we must rely on the Spirit to open the ears of our understanding. &nbsp;Recently as I studied 3 Nephi 11:3-7, I pondered about hearing a voice, but then finally coming to understand that voice. It says:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“...they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center...</p>
<p>“And...again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.</p>
<p>“And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.</p>
<p>“And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:</p>
<p>“Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased...hear ye him.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>These verses motivate me to open my ears to not just hear, but to understand God’s words to me. It is a great privilege to really communicate with God. &nbsp;I want that conduit to Heaven to be opened for me. &nbsp;He promises us that when we come to this earth we will never be alone. But that really depends on us, learning how to listen, to communicate, to open the door where Heavenly Father is waiting to speak to us. &nbsp;It depends on us being worthy of and accessing this great gift of the Holy Ghost, the great communicator, to help us understand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught that the Holy Ghost is the member of the Godhead who is the agent of personal revelation. &nbsp;He said, “As a personage of spirit, He can dwell in us and perform the essential role of communicator between the Father and the Son and the children of God on earth.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>If we open this gift of the Spirit, it will bless us in our communication with God and also in our relationships with others. &nbsp;Roommates can avoid conflict by talking things through with the Spirit. &nbsp;Colleagues are more likely to help one another if they understand each others’ needs and motives through effective communication. &nbsp;As we open the ears of our understanding by listening with the spirit, we will be able to love, inspire, unite, and help one another. &nbsp;It is our privilege to do so.</p>
<p>I have several daughters who are an example to me in taking full advantage of the privilege of sweet, spiritual communication with their children, with God as their partner. They tuck their children in bed at night and have one-on-one talking time with each child. &nbsp;These children are not just babies or toddlers. &nbsp;They range in age from 2 to 18 years old. &nbsp;Sometimes they sing or laugh; often they cry and pray together. Then when they are all settled down, my child, their mother, drops to her knees and talks to Heavenly Father about each child very specifically. &nbsp;The answers that come are sometimes very direct and individual, and sometimes they are more general, such as a feeling of overarching peace. &nbsp;Because they have been doing this since each child was an infant, they have open and real communication with the child. &nbsp;There is no such thing as a generation gap between mother and child. &nbsp;There is also very real communication with our Father in Heaven who loves and guides them specifically through the tumultuous child-rearing process. The Spirit is ever present in these communications.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught about the privilege of communicating with Our Heavenly Father in prayer. &nbsp;He said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Never assume that you can make it alone. &nbsp;You need the help of the Lord. &nbsp;Never hesitate to get on your knees in some private place and speak with Him. &nbsp;What a marvelous and wonderful thing is prayer. &nbsp;Think of it. &nbsp;We can actually speak with our Father in Heaven. &nbsp;He will hear and respond, but we need to listen to that response.</p>
<p>“Pray to the Lord with the expectation of answers. . . . The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries—we place our order and hang up. &nbsp;We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another.</p>
<p>“Be prayerful, my friends, and listen. &nbsp;You may never hear a voice. &nbsp;You likely will not. &nbsp;But in a manner that you cannot explain, you will be prompted and blessed. &nbsp;For the Lord has promised, “I will tell you in your. . . heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you. …”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>It is our privilege to partner with our Father in humble, meditative, listening prayer. &nbsp;As we open the ears of our understanding, He will warn, teach, chastise, inspire, comfort, praise, and love us. &nbsp;He will help us in our relationships with others and in our teaching and learning experiences.</p>
<p>Our learning model at BYU Hawaii is to “prepare-engage-improve.” &nbsp;It is important to take advantage of the privilege of engaging with each other in class. “Engaging” requires participation from everyone. &nbsp;A student in one of my classes acted dumbfounded when I told the group that I expected everyone to contribute, and that part of their grade would be based upon their participation in class. &nbsp;“Do you mean,” she said, “that we have to say something every time we meet?” &nbsp;“Yes,” I said. &nbsp;“It is a good way for us to get to know you and to learn from you. &nbsp;But most importantly is that you will remember best what you contributed. &nbsp;When you walk out of the classroom, you will think something like ‘that was a great class today. &nbsp;I said .. . such and such.” &nbsp;One reason that you remember your own comments so well is because they represent your personal preparation, but even more importantly because the spirit witnessed to you as you spoke that you were saying something of truth and significance.</p>
<p>As it so aptly describes in the Doctrine and Covenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>As we “engage” in our classrooms, let us live up to the privilege of “all...being edified of all.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our opportunity at this Zion university must be punctuated with Spirit-filled communication that comes from inviting the Spirit to be with us always, in our relationships, in our learning, and in our praying. It is a privilege to have the gift of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;It is a privilege to be working, studying, living, and learning here at BYU Hawaii. &nbsp;We must live up to these, our privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[President Tanner]</p>
<p>We have so many privileges here at BYU-Hawaii. So many gifts to unwrap. &nbsp;So many opportunities to seize. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin with an obvious one: You are privileged to get an education. &nbsp;Relatively few people in this world enjoy the blessing of a college education. &nbsp;Take full advantage of this privilege. &nbsp;Ironically, many people seem determined not to get their money’s worth from the price of tuition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been said that an education is “One of the few things a person is willing to pay for and not get.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>“Education seems to be . . . the only commodity of which the customer tries to get as little he can for his money.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>As a teacher, I used to tell my students that I wanted to give them their money’s worth. &nbsp;Get your money’s worth from college.</p>
<p>You are doubly blessed to learn in a Church university. &nbsp;Only a small fraction of Church members are privileged to attend one of the four LDS colleges and universities. &nbsp;You are among that chosen few. &nbsp;Please, please live up to this privilege!</p>
<p>Did you know that each student who attends a Church school is on scholarship? &nbsp;You all receive what I call a “tithing scholarship.” &nbsp;What you pay in tuition covers only a small fraction of the cost of your education. &nbsp;The rest is funded by the sacred tithes and offerings of the Church. The Church is making a tremendous investment in your education. &nbsp;Live up to this privilege by becoming the learners, leaders, and builders prophets have envisioned. Learn all you can here. &nbsp;Especially learn to be a life-long learner. &nbsp;Develop yourself as leaders of testimony and integrity. And commit yourself to becoming someone who will build your families, your Church, and your countries. &nbsp;Live up to the privilege of your tithing scholarship.</p>
<p>Some of you also receive additional support worth thousands of dollars a year through IWORK and other scholarships. &nbsp;And many students are also blessed by international internships, special programs like Enactus, and centers such as the Willes Center, which enrich your education. All these blessings are made possible through donors. &nbsp;Some of our donors will be on campus in November. &nbsp;We will invite the campus to mingle with them to express our gratitude for their support. We will also invite the campus community to give back, even if it is only a dollar, to show our desire to help others enjoy what we enjoy. &nbsp;We all drink from wells we did not dig and warm ourselves by fires we did not build. &nbsp;Let us live up to the privileges we enjoy from the generosity of others.</p>
<p>May we also live up to the privilege of being on a campus that cares about who you are and not just what you know. &nbsp;That cares about character. &nbsp;Live up to the privilege of attending a school with an Honor Code. &nbsp;Our Honor Code sets our campus apart from most other universities. &nbsp;It is a privilege to work and study in such a wholesome environment. Be a person who sustains this environment by how you look, how you act, and how you treat others whether on campus or off. &nbsp;Live up to your privilege. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Live up to the privilege of studying in a campus whose environment is not only wholesome but beautiful. Take good care of your dorms, the campus grounds and facilities, and this community of lovely Laie. &nbsp;Keep them clean. &nbsp;Develop a sense of kuleana (or stewardship) for where you live. &nbsp;I commend the example of Vice President John Bell and his wife Rhonda. &nbsp;On their daily morning walks they always carry plastic sacks to pick up trash. &nbsp;By this simple act, they express their love for our beautiful home. &nbsp;So can you!</p>
<p>Live up to your privilege to choose your unique educational journey. &nbsp;This year we have inaugurated a new curriculum, which we call Holokai — the Hawaiian word for voyage. &nbsp;I like the change both in substance and in name. The name Hokolai invites you to think of your education as a journey and the change in substance allows you greater freedom than before to chart your own course here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, the word curriculum comes from Latin for a race track. Anciently, a curriculum was what you ran around; later the term was applied to education. &nbsp;And ever since many students have seen the curriculum as an obstacle course they had to run around four times, as a freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior. &nbsp;As they lapped the track they saw themselves as jumping over hurdles or through hoops prescribed by the university. They often described this educational run-around as “getting my GEs (or my major requirements) out of the way.” This ultimately qualified students to get their degree out of the way, so I suppose they could find work they could get out of the way, so they could have children they could get out of the way, so they could get their life out of the way and settle down to a comfortable grave. &nbsp;Not a happy way to live!</p>
<p>By contrast, “holokai” invites you to see your education not as a racetrack strewn with obstacles which others have thrown in your way but as a purposeful journey of your choosing—a journey that leads to graduation and beyond. Your holokai enables you to chart a course for learning things that are important and practical to you. &nbsp;It also allows you to indulge your curiosity and passions. &nbsp;And it invites you to develop wayfaring skills that will take you far after you leave.</p>
<p>So live up to the privilege of the greater freedom you now have to choose your educational Holokai.</p>
<p>Live up to the privilege of belonging to such a diverse, international community. A prophet of God called this school a “living laboratory” in gospel-based intercultural education, where “individuals who share the teachings of the Master Teacher have an opportunity to develop appreciation, tolerance, and esteem for one another.” Seize this opportunity! &nbsp;You likely will never belong to such a community again. &nbsp;So get to know people from other countries and backgrounds. &nbsp;Break out of your language and culture enclaves. &nbsp;Be inclusive. &nbsp;Sit with new people in the cafeteria. Include others in your activities and study groups. Make friends from around the world. &nbsp;And, as Sister Tanner reminded us, communicate with the Spirit, which can help us transcend cultural and linguistic divides. &nbsp;Live up to the privilege of learning in one of the most internationally diverse universities in the world.</p>
<p>Live up to the privilege of participating in our campus-centered wards and stakes. These provide many opportunities to serve others and to recharge your spiritual batteries. &nbsp;And to the privilege of attending weekly devotionals.</p>
<p>Especially live up to your privilege of attending a university located next door to a temple of God. &nbsp;I am persuaded that President David O. McKay insisted that the Church College be established here because he wanted it near a temple. &nbsp;So go to the temple as often as you can. &nbsp;And whether or not you attend the temple, keep yourself always worthy to enter the House of the Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sister, we are so privileged to work and study here in this special place. &nbsp;Let us live up to our privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in conclusion, I want to share a tender but little known story from the life of Emma Smith. It is instructive as we consider this topic of living up to our privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he was being hauled off to Carthage, Joseph and Emma exchanged heart-wrenching, hurried farewells. &nbsp;An anxious Emma asked Joseph for a blessing, but there was no time. &nbsp;So he told her to “write out the best blessing [she] could think of and he would sign the same on his return.” &nbsp;Likely, that same evening, on June 24th, she wrote down what she called the “desires of my heart.” &nbsp;Here are some things she wrote. &nbsp;They express her desire to live up to her privileges as wife of the prophet, mother of her children, and Elect Lady of the Church:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"I crave as the richest of heaven’s blessings . . . wisdom from my Heavenly Father.</em></p>
<p><em>I desire the Spirit of God to know and understand myself.</em></p>
<p><em>I desire a fruitful, active mind, that I may be able to comprehend the designs of God, when revealed through his servants without doubting.</em></p>
<p><em>I desire a spirit of discernment.</em></p>
<p><em>I particularly desire wisdom to bring up my children.</em></p>
<p><em>I desire . . . to wear a cheerful countenance, live to perform all the work that I covenanted to perform in the spirit-world.</em></p>
<p><em>I desire that whatever may be my lot through life I may be enabled to acknowledge the hand of God in all things."</em><sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph did not live long enough to sign this blessing. &nbsp;But no matter, for these are blessings that Emma could secure by living up to her privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I testify that we, too, can secure the blessings of Heaven by living up to our privileges. &nbsp;In this sense we are like Emma. &nbsp;We can largely write our own blessings if they correspond to the righteous desires of our hearts. The reason we sometimes don’t receive all the blessings that are rightfully ours to claim is that we do not live up to our privileges. &nbsp;Our Father in Heaven wants to welcome us home, to put a royal robe on us, and crown us with innumerable blessings. He wants to give us divine gifts, including ultimately the gift of eternal life, but we must open His gifts.</p>
<p>May we live up to our privileges. Let us unwrap God’s gifts, which lie in such abundance before us, so that it may never be said of us that we have lived below our privileges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>
