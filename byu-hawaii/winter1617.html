<p>Brothers and Sisters, aloha.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question. Did you wake up this morning in a great mood and ready to face this beautiful day or did you just want to roll over, smash your alarm, and go back to sleep? Life is full of choices. How did you choose to start your day today?</p>
<p>Our first parents, Adam and Eve, remained in a state of innocence while they were in the Garden of Eden until they made a choice to partake of the fruit and were cast out. Lehi gave us additional insight into this choice when he taught us that, “...if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created... And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">sin.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></span></span><span style="font-size: 8.33333px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Then Lehi taught that, “Adam fell that men might be and men are that they might have jo<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">y.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></span></span>&nbsp;I would like to focus today on this teaching that men are that thy might have joy. Notice that the Lord didn’t say we would have joy but specifically that we might have joy. That means we have some choices and decisions to make so that we have joy in our lives.</p>
<p>As Adam and Eve recognized the principle of having joy, they were filled with the Holy Ghost and “Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God. And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></span></span></p>
<p>Elder Jack H. Goaslind taught that “Our yearnings for happiness were implanted in our hearts by Deity. They represent a kind of homesickness, for we have a residual memory of our premortal existence. They are also a foretaste of the fullness of joy that is promised to the faithful. We can expect with perfect faith that our Father will fulfill our innermost longings for jo<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">y.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></span></span><span style="font-size: 8.33333px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In order to fulfill these yearnings for joy, we must each realize that we have a responsibility in bringing happiness and joy into our lives and into the lives of others. Abraham Lincoln once said, “Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be,” and Henri J.M. Nouwen stated, “It is important to become aware that at every moment of our life we have an opportunity to choose joy...it is in the choice that our true freedom lies.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>So did you make up your mind today to be happy? Each morning we can start the day by making a conscious choice to be happy. This is a choice the Lord wants and expects us to make each day. Happiness doesn’t always come without effort. We can’t sit around waiting for it to find us, we must choose to find and create happiness and joy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some spend their lives seeking happiness in many different forms of pleasure like amusement parks, a hike in nature, hobbies, sports, and now more than ever, on the internet, on social media, in computer games, and even in inappropriate web sites that tear down our spirits. Many seek for happiness by acquiring things of the world such as a big house, a fancy car, expensive clothing, the latest gaming system, the newest phone, or many other material possessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These temporary pleasures produce a short-term happiness that fades when the activity ends, the possessions wear out, you have conquered the latest game, or another new phone comes out. There is no true and lasting happiness in the things we possess. Happiness and joy come from who we are and who we become while we are here on this earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now please understand that I am not saying all of these things are bad or do not have value. Indeed, spending time with family and friends engaged in good wholesome activities creates lasting friendships and memories that provide the foundation of happiness. It is upon this foundation that we continue to build a happiness that doesn’t fade but endures beyond this life. We build an eternal happiness which comes when our thoughts and actions are in complete harmony with the teachings of the gospel.</p>
<p>Let me share a few ways that we can build this eternal happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Service</p>
<p>A Chinese proverb states, “If you want happiness for an hour – take a nap. If you want happiness for a day – go fishing. If you want, happiness for a year – inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime – help someone else.”</p>
<p>King Benjamin taught us that when we are in the service of our fellow beings we are only in the service of our God.<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Serving others is one of the ways we find joy and happiness in this life.</p>
<p>Christ said, “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save i<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">t.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></span></span>&nbsp;If you would find happiness and joy in this life and in the eternities, lose your life in the service to others.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Temple Service</p>
<p>One way of accomplishing this is to serve and help others on both sides of the veil by serving in the temple, either as a patron or as a temple worker. Elder Franklin D Richards stated, “As we do temple work, we develop a spiritual kinship with our Heavenly Father and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that brings us peace, happiness, and eternal jo<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">y.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>The Lord taught us “If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things – that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eterna<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">l.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></span></span>&nbsp;One sure place to receive this revelation and knowledge and find this eternal happiness is in the temple engaged in temple service.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Following Promptings</p>
<p>Another way to ensure our happiness is to learn to follow the promptings that we receive from the Lord through the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before my mission, I attended Dixie College in St. George, Utah. I completed a year of school before and enjoyed the experience and the many friends I made while at the university. Following my mission, I was living at home with my parents and three of my younger sisters. I had a good job working in a uranium mill and I also worked as a substitute teacher for the school district.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One Thursday evening after returning from work, I told my mom that I needed to drive to St. George the next day, a trip of about 350 miles or 560 kilometers. She asked me why and I told her I wasn’t sure; maybe I needed to see my friends that had returned from their missions. Even though I was supposed to work on that Friday, I still felt strongly that I had to go.</p>
<p>I left early in the morning and arrived in St. George about noon. I met a couple of my friends who were getting ready to go to class. It was a performance group we all sang with prior to our missions so I knew the songs, and they invited me to join them which I did. Following the class, while walking across campus, my friend mentioned that it was the last day to register for classes for the spring semester. Again, I felt prompted to go to the registrar and I registered for school. There was an opening in the apartment where my friends were living so I had a place to live. The next morning, one of my friends and I made the 350 mile (560 kilometer) drive back to my home, loaded my things in the car and then drove another 6 hours back to St. George. We arrived in time to sing at the program with the performance group that night where I met this cute girl named Linda Williams. She was vibrant and bubbly and I was immediately attracted to her. I asked my friends who she was and they informed me that I shouldn’t waste my time because she had a missionary returning soon and she had made it very clear to everyone that she was waiting for him. I took heed of what I thought was wise council from my friends and I decided not to ask her out.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I kept running into her around campus and each time I saw her, my desire to ask her on a date increased, but remembering the advice of my friends, I still didn’t do it. After about six weeks had passed, I finally decided that I didn’t care what my friends told me, I was going to ask her out.</p>
<p>So I started planning how I would ask her out. As she said, I wrote a series of poems describing different professors and friends around campus that we both kne. I put them in separate envelopes along with a few letters of my name. I put the first envelope on the windshield of her car where I knew she would find it. It took her three days to figure out who all the people were, find them, collect the envelopes, and then piece my name together. As I went to my car one day after my classes, I found a plate of brownies she had left with a note saying she would love to go out with me.</p>
<p>We had a lot of fun getting to know each other over the next 5½ weeks at which time, we went out on an unforgettable date that she described. The details of that date are a story for another day, but it should be noted that the date ended with a bouquet of twelve red roses and one white rose with a scroll attached to it asking her to marry me. We had been dating for&nbsp;5½&nbsp;weeks. As she said, I was ready and she was not, but three days later on the grounds of the St. George temple she said yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There're a lot more to this story but the important part for now is this; that was Linda’s last semester at Dixie College before graduating and moving on. She had a missionary coming home, and everyone, including their families, expected them to get married. Had I not followed the prompting I received that day to go to St. George or the prompting to register for school, I would not have met her and her last name would likely not have been Black today. Following that prompting brought eternal happiness into my life as we were sealed in the St. George Temple five months later for time and all eternity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story doesn't end there. About a year later, we were both working full time and I was trying to finish my school. Things were tight, but one day as I was talking with her uncle, who had recently retired from the United States Air Force, he suggested I look into the Air Force as a career and said they would help me with my education. I had never even considered joining the military but with his help, I was able to get into the computer programming career field I desired and I joined the Air Force. Financially, the Air Force helped pay for my school expenses and I was able to get a Bachelors and a Master’s degree. If I hadn’t followed the prompting to go to St. George, I wouldn’t have married Linda and wouldn’t have met her uncle and my career would likely have taken a different pathway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One never knows when this type of story will become their own happy story. We all receive promptings every day. We are prompted to say a kind word to someone as we walk by, to knock on a neighbor’s door, to go to class a little early for some reason, to attend a certain activity, to contact someone we visit or home teach, to walk home a different way, to go eat at a specific time, and the list could go on. We never know the result of following these promptings. But if we do follow them, you can be certain that the impact will bring a positive result ending with happiness and joy.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example of someone else's life being changed because someone else followed a prompting. Remember when the Savior was walking among the crowd and suddenly stopped and asked his apostles, “Who touched me?” Peter and the other apostles reminded Him that He was in a large crowd and questioned why He would ask who touched Him. He replied, “Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.” The Savior was prompted to stop. The apostles didn’t understand why but imagine how it changed the life of this daughter of God when she heard Jesus say, “Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peac<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">e.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup><span style="font-size: 8.33333px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>When we follow these seemingly little promptings, we inevitably find great joy, and our lives and the lives we touch can be changed forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Keeping the Commandments</p>
<p>Another way to find happiness was defined by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he taught that, “Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If we are to have joy in our lives, our footsteps should always be found in these clearly defined paths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Benjamin invited his people to “consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happines<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">s.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup></span><span style="font-size: 8.33333px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The commandments are a true guide to finding happiness in this world and in the world to come. Christ told His disciples: “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love. ...These things I have spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We read about the state of the Nephites after Christ had visited them and organized His church in the land. The apostles taught them and performed many mighty miracles and the people lived in peace. The scriptures tell us that the people “did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God...and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A peaceful and eternal happiness will come to each of us as we strive to keep the commandments and prayerfully seek help from the Lord in doing so. If we are to be happy, we must keep the commandments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Repentance and Forgiveness</p>
<p>In fact, Alma taught us that “wickedness never was happiness<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On occasion, we make mistakes and we disobey a commandment. However, we have the capacity to repent of our sins and to experience the sweet joy of forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Marion G. Romney taught that, “Jesus Christ, our Savior, has the power to heal our spirits. Every person’s spirit is ill when it is burdened with sin. No son or daughter of God is ever completely happy until his spirit is healed by the power of the Spirit of God. When one receives forgiveness, his spirit is healed and he has peace of conscience. Thereafter his happiness increases as he strives to perfect himself by inculcating into his life the attributes of charity..<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Christ gave us an example of the joy experienced through repentance in the parable of the lost sheep when the shepherd invited his friends to rejoice with him, for he had “found [his] sheep which was lost...Likewise,” Jesus explained, “joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repentet<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">h.”<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In another parable, a father rejoiced in the return of a prodigal son, explaining, “For this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is foun<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">d.”<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these examples teach of the pain of being lost and the joy of returning. The Lord taught Adam and Eve, in order to know pleasure, they had to know pain. Some of the pain we experience in life comes from the adversity we encounter. We would not be living the Lord’s great plan of happiness if we did not encounter challenges and trials in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Overcoming Trials and Adversity</p>
<p>Elder Jack H. Goaslind taught that, “Adversity is also part of our mortal probation, experienced by everyone. It is different, however, from sin. While we can choose to avoid sin, we usually cannot choose whether we experience adversity. I am convinced if we are to have happiness in our hearts, we must learn how to preserve it, in our hearts, in the midst of trouble and trial. We can control our attitude toward adversity. Some people are defeated and embittered by it, while others triumph over it and cultivate godlike attributes in the midst o<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">f it.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trials can have a tendency to diminish our happiness. They don’t generally seem like joyful experiences when we are in the midst of them. Satan tries to use the trials and adversity as a way of tearing us down and breaking our spirits so that we turn away from the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wilhelm von Humboldt once said, “Our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of life than on the nature of those events themselves.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trials are what give us opportunity to prove to ourselves and to the Lord that we will do all things which He has commanded us to do. I believe that most of us are either in the midst of a trial, just overcoming a trial or facing the next great trial in our lives. It’s part of the plan.</p>
<p>If we didn’t have trials and decisions to make, we would be caught up in Lucifer’s plan which was to have all of us come to earth with no difficulties or trials and in the end, all return to our Heavenly Father. No choices. No opportunity to succeed or fail. No happiness and no joy!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we do have choices and we do have this time of life to be tested and to be tried. The question is what do we do when we face trials?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi was persecuted by his brothers Laman and Lemuel on a regular basis. While crossing the great waters on the ship Nephi had constructed under the direction of the Lord, his brothers got angry with him and bound him to the mast of the ship. The sea was angry and the tempests were sore. The boat was about to be swallowed up by the sea. When Laman and Lemuel were finally convinced to let Nephi go free, do you recall what Nephi did? His wrists and ankles were swollen from being tied up tight for four days and he said, “...great was the soreness thereof. Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord because of mine afflictions<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we face our trials and tribulations with a thankful heart praising God all the day long or are we looking at our trails and asking, “Why me?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley’s mother, Ada Bitner Hinckley, often taught her children that “a happy attitude and smiling countenance could boost one over almost any misfortune and that every individual was responsible for his own happiness<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.”<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I traveled to Osorno Chile to pick up our son when he completed his mission. As we traveled around the mission with him, we took many pictures and the memory in our camera was getting full. So one evening we left the cottage where we were staying and went to an internet café so we could download the pictures onto a thumb drive. We were only gone a short time but when we returned, we found our cottage had been broken into and we had been robbed. We called the police and by the time they completed their investigation and let us go, it was about 3:00 int the morning. Because that cottage was a mess from the dusting for fingerprints and everything else the police had done, they moved us to a different cottage and we went to sleep but we had to wake up at 6:00 in the morning for a scheduled hike with a group to the top of an active volcano. Rather than sleep in, we chose to get up and take the hike and created a wonderful memory with our son. We never did get any of our items returned to us. My son could have been very upset because he had lost so many memories from his mission including his missionary bag containing his scriptures, but instead, he simply said that he hoped the robbers would read his scriptures and join the church.</p>
<p>What would have happened if we had just gotten angry at the situation and decided to just sleep through the hike the next morning? In that case, our trial would have taken control of our lives and we would have been miserable. Instead, we chose to be happy, to climb the volcano and we had a wonderful time with our son and the rest of the group. &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley often taught that, “Things work out. It isn’t as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don’t worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work out. If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us. ...If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our praye<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">rs.”<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This quote is now printed over the top of a picture that I took of the volcano in Chile that we climbed that day and it sits in my office as a reminder of how we can find joy even in the midst of trial and adversity if we choose to be happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past eighteen months, in addition to the everyday trials and tribulations that our family encounters, we have had some interesting trials with health issues. My wife has been through a number of surgeries on her eyes and my son has broken both of his arms, at the same time! Despite these challenges, as you can see, my son still chose to smile through his adversity and my wife has been an example of how we can choose to be optimistic and happy in the midst of adversity. The trials have not diminished her hope in an eternity of happiness with her family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joel Osteen said, “You’re going to go through tough times – that’s life. But I say, 'nothing happens to you, it happens for you.'"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Towards the end of His life, the Savior spoke with His disciples about the trials that were coming. After explaining the adversity He would face, He said, “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the wo<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">rld.”<sup><a href="#FN22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Through the Atonement</p>
<p>As we face the challenges and adversity and make mistakes in this great plan of happiness, we must realize that the Savior has overcome the world through His infinite atonement and that without that atonement, eternal happiness would not be possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oakes said, “despite all we can do, we cannot have a fulness of joy in this world or through our own effort<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">s.<sup><a href="#FN23">23</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Only in Christ can our joy be full. This is why the angel proclaimed: 'I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day … a Saviour, which is Christ the L<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ord.'<sup><a href="#FN24">24</a>&nbsp;</sup></span>We are able to have a fulness of joy only when spirit and body are inseparably connected in the glorious resurrection to celestial gl<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ory.<sup><a href="#FN25">25</a></sup></span>&nbsp;That joy, of course, comes only through the mercy of the Holy Messiah, whose resurrection broke the bands of death and whose atonement unlocks the reservoir of mercy by which we can be cleansed of our sins and come into the presence of God to receive the fulness of the Father...God’s mercy is the only source of the ultimate and eternal joy, which restores every loss, dries every tear, and erases every pain. Eternal joy transcends all suffering.<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">”<sup><a href="#FN26">26</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</p>
<p>Elder Jack H. Goaslind said, “Striving for happiness is a long, hard journey with many challenges. It requires eternal vigilance to win the victory. You cannot succeed with sporadic little flashes of effort. Constant and valiant living is necessary... It requires that you make a deliberate decision to do good and then carry out your decision. Do it. Simply do it, and do it long enough that you experience success, no matter how hard it may seem. Your victory over self brings communion with God and results in happiness—lasting and eternal happines<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">s.”<sup><a href="#FN27">27</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf has taught us that, “So often we get caught up in the illusion that there is something just beyond our reach that would bring us happiness: a better family situation, a better financial situation, or the end of a challenging trial." But, he said, "The older we get, the more we look back and realize that external circumstances don’t really matter or determine our happiness. We do matter. We determine our happiness. You and I are ultimately in charge of our own happine<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ss.”<sup><a href="#FN28">28</a></sup></span><span style="font-size: 8.33333px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So take charge, Brothers and Sisters. Don’t ask “why me?” Make this a life of happiness and joy for yourself and for those around you.</p>
<p>As President Thomas S. Monson has frequently taught us, “relish life as we live it, find joy in the journey, and share our love with friends and family.”</p>
<p>Speaking of love, I recognize that today is Valentine’s Day. So I will close with these thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Husbands, love your wives with all your hearts. Wives, love your husbands. Parents, love your children. Children (which we all are), love, respect and honor your parents. Return to them the great love they have given to you throughout your life.</p>
<p>I thank my wonderful wife Linda, who for the past 35 years has been the source of joy and happiness in our family and especially in my life. I continue to pray that I can bring as much joy and happiness into her life as she brings into mine. That dozen roses (and I increase the single to a dozen white) will remind us of that day 36 years ago, when she said, "Yes." I love her with all my heart and am so glad that we will get to spend eternity together.</p>
<p>I am grateful for a loving Savior who atoned for us and made it possible for us to overcome trials. I’m grateful that He created a way for me to return to my Heavenly Father even though I make mistakes and need forgiveness. I’m grateful that I can know Him and continue to gain an understanding of the wonderful plan of happiness created by a loving Heavenly Father who wants us to return and enjoy eternal happiness as families, with Him forever. I bear testimony that He lives and wants us to be happy, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha.</p>
<p>I want to thank you all for attending devotional today, as I know with the end of the semester approaching, you could have chosen to use this hour for other purposes. So thank you for attending. I feel very blessed to have my parents here to introduce me at devotional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is their tenth year doing missionary service for the church. They have served together as Mission President in Papua New Guinea, Mission Training Center President in New Zealand, Service Center Manager in Papua New Guinea and Seminary and Institute in Papua New Guinea. They love the people of Papua New Guinea. Today, they are serving here at the Polynesian Cultural Center in the New Zealand village. It feels like a full circle today since my brothers and I served in the Polynesian Cultural Center, and now our parents serve there as well. Their service has blessed my brothers and I in numerous ways, as well as my brothers’ families. I also know that several of you here have been under their leadership at one time or another and have been blessed by their service as well. I have always admired their positive attitude and resilience when faced with overwhelming challenges during their years of service. And as a result, it is the theme of “conquering your challenges” that I wish to talk to you about today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liken our challenges can be likened unto a big hill that, at times, may seem impossible or difficult to climb, that we even give up before we even start. We often do not realize how much effort is required to climb the hill because its steepest gradient is sometimes obscured with forestry.</p>
<p>In Auckland, New Zealand there is a hill called “One Tree Hill”. This is probably one of the few landmarks in New Zealand that did not feature in any of the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings movies. At the bottom of One Tree Hill is a large surrounding park that has a number of grassy areas which are used for popular New Zealand outdoor activities.</p>
<p>People often come and enjoy the grassy areas without ever going up the hill, because they either do not need to go up the hill or they choose not too. However, others do take on the trek up “One Tree Hill”, which begins with a noticeable steady incline. The huge trees at the bottom of the hill make the height and depth of the mountain difficult to detect, which may result in you thinking that you are merely on a leisurely walk. However, once you pass the gate that begins the upward climb you soon begin to visualize the extent of the journey ahead and quickly realize two key features.</p>
<p>First, there are actually two hills to climb to get to the top and second, shade becomes scarce the more you climb up the hill, hence the name "One Tree Hill". Once you climb the first hill there is a brief flat area to regain your breath before taking on the last hill. Then, there is a small set of stairs before you reach the very top of the hill. Once you reach the top of the hill, you are rewarded with the beauty of Auckland city. You can take your time and walk around the top of the hill and bask in the views of Auckland from different perspectives. After taking in such views the walk almost seems bearable, even perhaps with an upbeat attitude, because you quickly realize that the hardest part of the journey has already occurred. Despite feeling some fatigue while walking down, using a different bunch of muscles, the journey will most likely seem much more pleasant. As you continue walking around the bottom of the mountain, your walk ends with a grove of trees that cover the road acting like a welcome parade to the end of your challenge or trek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The walk up and around “One Tree Hill” can be likened unto the many challenges that we face in our personal lives. Sometimes when we realize how hard the challenge is we give up before we even attempt the challenge. Or just when we think we have conquered our challenge we realize we still have some way to go. Also, sometimes the extent of our challenge is masked by different circumstances that give us a false impression of the task before us. But, if we diligently take on the challenges that are given to each of us, we are able to see the vast beauty of success and achievement from different perspectives. After conquering a challenge, we are more than likely to take on subsequent challenges with a different attitude and renewed belief. We also experience the welcoming of great joy for all of our hard work at the end of the challenge.</p>
<p>Today I would like to offer three simple suggestions to help conquer your individual “One Tree Hill”. First, surround yourself with the right people. Notice here I say the “right people” and not just “good people”. When thinking about the right people, I refer to seeking the assistance of people who can provide the most appropriate support that's directly related to the particular challenge that you are facing. Let me share an example to illustrate this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had often driven up "One Tree Hill" to show friends that would visit New Zealand, the beautiful sights at the top of the hill. But, I had never taken on the challenge of actually walking up the hill. As you can imagine, driving up the hill is a lot easier than walking up the hill. In finding the support of someone to help me conquer this challenge of walking up One Tree Hill, it was obvious that I needed to find the right person. Not just a good person. This would mean looking for someone who, 1) wanted to actually walk up the hill, 2) was in reasonable physical condition and 3) would be a positive and supportive help for me in conquering this challenge. It would not be useful to ask someone for help who was a good person, but had no interest at all in walking up “One Tree Hill”.</p>
<p>It just so happened that I was extremely blessed to meet an Olympic champion, Valerie Adams, when her and her husband moved into my ward in New Zealand. She was seeking a friend in the ward and I was seeking a walking buddy. Who better to seek help from, than someone who had participated in four Olympics, medalled 3 times (with 2 gold and 1 silver), and a champion of 5 World Diamond Leagues in her respective sport, which was shotput. Valerie trains up to 5 hours a day and was therefore in obvious great physical condition. I, on the other hand, was in the below average category of physical fitness. As you can see from the following picture, there is a slight height difference between Valerie and I and so I knew that keeping up with her long strides could prove problematic. In this picture here I am actually standing on a step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time we walked up "One Tree Hill", we had just made it past the first major climb and she could hear my heavy breathing. She kindly asked me, in a very caring manner, “Do you have asthma”. With a look of utter exhaustion on my face I answered, “No, this is how I normally breathe”. We both broke out into laughter and I felt an instant sense of care and support from her. Here she was this four time Olympian, walking with me up this hill. One thing I learned from Valerie was she taught me some really good breathing techniques to help me make it up the rest of the hill.</p>
<p>After 10 weeks of walking up “One Tree Hill” I was able to make it up those steep parts of the hill in a much better manner than that first time with Valerie walking with me and supporting me all the way. At the end of the 10 weeks she would push me a little harder. She would say, "Okay, we're going to run this part now." I would smile and say, "Okay I can't wait." Our favorite part, though, was always taking some time to enjoy the reward at the top of the hill. Basking in the beauty of the city always made me want to finish strong. We also had time to take a quick selfie. Whenever we would walk up "One Tree Hill", Valerie would get stopped on several occasions by people who recognized her. I always welcomed those opportunities because I'd have a chance to catch my breath. Walking with Valerie always made me want to finish strong when walking back down the hill and around the bottom of the park. Valerie, at the time, was the right person to surround myself with in trying to conquer this challenge. With her extensive career and world experiences, Valerie also proved to be very pivotal in other challenges that I was trying to conquer at that time of my life. In some cases when you surround yourself with the right people, or the right person in this case, they prove to be a pivotal instrument in your life on more than one occasion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you prepare for the challenge of finals and end of semester responsibilities, take a moment to ask yourself, “Am I surrounding myself with the right people to help conquer those challenges”. Please note, this is not an invitation to instantly judge the person sitting next to you or the people that you associate the most with. Rather, it is an invitation to ponder about who you believe is the right person to best help you with the particular challenges in your life.</p>
<p>As you ponder purposefully, let the spirit talk to you and in some cases give you names of particular people who would be best to help you. Once you have a name, act upon the prompting immediately by approaching that person, and approaching them with confidence because you know it was a prompting of the spirit. You should always take confidence in the Lord’s promptings, Brothers and Sisters, as they are the most credible sources that are based in truth. This is very important today, especially in a day where social media continues to be a major source of the decisions that we make.</p>
<p>In hindsight, meeting Valerie was no coincidence. The night before I met her and her husband Gabriel at church, my parents had just left New Zealand. My cousins that I were staying with had all gone away for a few weeks and I was home by myself. I wasn't feeling well. I had the flu, and I was kind of feeling sorry for myself. The next morning was Sunday and as I prayed, I expressed to Heavenly Father, "I'm going to stay home today to recover from my illness." When I think about it now, my prayer was kind of like, "I'm going to stay home today, because I'm feeling sorry for myself." The Lord quietly prompted me saying, “Go to church, and I promise you, you will feel better”. Valerie and I both talk about how we were meant to meet each other that day, and I am very blessed to have her in my life. In this case, the Lord led me to whom I needed to surround myself with to help me with more than one challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second suggestion I offer is to work hard consistently. Here I talk of being hardworking, persistent and committing yourself to consistent daily activities that work towards conquering your challenge. My parents are great examples of working consistently everyday in the different capacities as missionaries. As previously mentioned, with regards to challenges, we sometimes give up before even trying. This is sometimes due to that fact that we are not always willing to put in the hard work required to conquer them.</p>
<p>When you pass the first gate of "One Tree Hill", and begin to see to what extent the journey of the climb entails, you may change your mind and convince yourself, "You know what? This challenge is too difficult," and turn around and take the easy walk. Or, you may decide that the climb is not worth it, and continue walking around the bottom on the flat easy path. When making such a decision, we miss out on conquering challenges and we also lack potential opportunities for progression. Sometimes we lack motivation to be diligent or sometimes we become distracted. Therefore, we need to find something that inspires us to be enthusiastic about conquering our challenges. Now I know that's not an easy thing to do. At this point when it becomes too hard for us, we almost need an intervening outstretched hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experienced this recently when I returned home to NZ, to complete my PhD thesis for examination. I knew that some changes needed to be made with regards to my research, but when I got home I realized it was an extensive revision of my previously drafted chapters. Rather than try and come up with a plan of how to be diligent and hardworking on my own, I felt the Lord intervene in my life in a very real way. I actually tried to come up with a daily working plan of how to take on this challenge, but I never quite felt like I had done enough. The Lord's intervention was real because it came in such a manner that I knew that if I did not follow it, then I would most likely not conquer this challenge. The Lord worked through my PhD supervisor who was someone who that I followed with exactness. My supervisor put a very stringent plan with restrictions on how my daily time was to be spent. My supervisor insisted that I dedicate 10 hours a day to writing and revision and that those 10 hours needed to be done on campus with someone signing me in and someone signing me out each day. Because school was some distance from where I was living at the time, this meant I needed to catch a ferry to and from the city and walk an additional 40 mins to and from the ferry to campus.</p>
<p>Let me just share with you my daily schedule:&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5am Wake up and shower (It was winter time in New Zealand, so it was still dark.)</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5:30 scripture study and prayer&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6:00 Breakfast and make my lunch&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6:30 I would pack my bag and make my way to catch the ferry</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>7:00 I would catch the ferry and I would go early to the ferry to ensure a seat inside especially in the middle of the NZ winter&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>7:35 I would arrive and make my walk up to campus&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>7:55 I would get there and find someone to sign me in for the day and began writing and revising by 8am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> Throughout the day </span>I would take three 15 min breaks, one half hour break for lunch (when you think about it, a half hour break is very short for a Maori in New Zealand) and then I would pack up at 6pm and have someone sign me out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6:00 pm I would walk to catch the 6:30 ferry</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> I would g</span>et off the ferry at 7:10 pm and arrive home by 7:20pm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only people I saw during the day was my cousin who would say goodbye to me in the morning, the two other PhD students I was studying with, and my ferry friends. My wonderful cousin Cindy blessed me each night with a delicious dinner to finish off a hardworking day. I would fall into bed absolutely exhausted no later than 9 pm every night. Now let me reiterate here that this is not a daily schedule of consistent hard work that I would have chosen for myself, yet, it was the exact one that was needed to conquer my challenge.</p>
<p>I think Heavenly Father knew that. He knew that I wouldn't choose such a rigorous schedule and so He intervened for me, which I am so grateful for. Upon reflection, I recognize the Lord’s pivotal hand in making sure this schedule of hard work and diligence was put in place in such a manner that I would have to adhere to it with exactness. When we are struggling to be consistently hardworking in conquering our challenges, sometimes we need to ask for added help. When in doubt ask the Lord to help you and see him reply appropriately to your plea for help. I experienced that on several occasions back in New Zealand, and I have such a firm testimony of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third, suggestion I’d like to offer is to serve the Lord in a greater capacity. I learned that service has everything to do with academic study, spiritual well being, physical fitness and even expanding ones social skills. Let me first explain what I mean by a greater capacity. Here I refer to service that leaves you exhausted to a point where you have literally given everything you possibly can.</p>
<p>Again, in conquering my challenge of completing my PhD, I was prompted to immediately serve. So when I go home I approached Bishop Stevens in the Howick ward in Auckland NZ, I said that I needed to serve and so please give me a calling. He shared some potential callings with me and I instantly said, “Well I don't really want those callings, but anything else would be great”. That evening in my prayers I pleaded with Heavenly Father, asking him, "Please help me with my school work and please let me know how I can better serve”. Right at that very point I experienced a gentle rebuke from the Lord. It went something like this “Well I did let you know how you can serve, but you said no”. Right then, I knew I needed to serve anywhere that was asked of me and do so even if it wasn't necessarily something I wanted to do. I also realized then that I needed to give service joyfully and continuously.</p>
<p>As a result, I became the super substitute teacher in our ward. I taught seminary, Relief Society, institute, gospel doctrine and I even spoke twice in Sacrament meeting. On one of those occasions, I was only given 15 minutes preparation time, but it did not faze me at all. All I knew is that the Lord wanted me to serve and so I should serve joyfully and continuously. With that 15 minute preparation and the experiences I gained in my studies and being here at BYU, I was able to fulfill that calling. At that time I felt really good about my service and I felt, "Man I am serving! I'm a great server and I am serving in full capacity." I kind of patted myself on the back and thought, "Go you, Nancy!"</p>
<p>But it was not yet a greater capacity. Let me continue and explain why it was not yet a greater capacity. I knew we had a weekend holiday coming up and my cousins whom I was staying with were going away for the weekend to a Stake YSA camp. I was looking forward to having the whole house to myself and being able to get in some extra writing and studying time on a holiday.</p>
<p>As everyone was getting ready to go to camp the Lord prompted me again and asked, “So what service are you providing for the camp?” I remember responding, “Well none really because, remember I am the super substitute in the ward and I'm already serving fully”. May I just mention here that the Lord and I have great conversations. I understand and know how He talks to me and at times it has been a clear and vivid speaking voice. I think that's because sometime I don't listen and so for me He knows, "I need to tell her directly." This conversation was one of those times.</p>
<p>I remember telling the Lord all the reasons why I did not need to serve at camp and the reasons why my character and personality and my body type is such that it is not really made for camping situations. But in a very audible and clear voice the Lord said to me “go and serve at camp”. I was instantly moved to act and offer my services at camp. I thought that maybe they'd want me to do a few workshops, maybe use some of my experience as a teacher, but it seemed that my services were only needed in the kitchen. So for 3 days, I served in the kitchen at the Panmure, Auckland Stake YSA camp. I cooked, I served, I cleaned, I prepared endlessly for three days. At the end of the first day I was absolutely exhausted that sleep was almost instant for me.</p>
<p>This was the very first time I had truly experienced and recognized serving in a greater capacity. What better way to retire to your bed at night than to be absolutely exhausted with service. When I arrived home from camp I received an email from my supervisor telling me he had signed off on three of my chapters. I firmly believe that service to the point of exhaustion was pivotal in conquering that part of my PhD submission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges we encounter are sometimes part of the career choices and paths we have chosen to pursue. Like the challenges you experience here at BYU, in your schooling. However, in other circumstances some challenges are put upon us from no fault of our own. An example of this is when one struggles with an illness or personal circumstances that are out of our control. How do we conquer these challenges? Those challenges can be conquered using these same suggestions that I offer with an added positive attitude and love for our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our family has experienced this type of challenge. My brother was recently diagnosed last year with MDS myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a type of blood cancer. My brother Wayne, like myself, was an alumni here BYUH and he too worked at the Polynesian Cultural Center in the night show and in reservations with President Grace. They looked a bit younger back then. He is the assistant rugby coach for the BYU Provo rugby team and he's very involved with a lot of the Polynesian YSA living in Utah. With his illness the marrow in his bones are unable to produce immature blood cells that mature into the essential blood cells that he needs. As a result he requires regular blood transfusions and he also undergoes regular chemotherapy treatments.</p>
<p>Last week my brother completed biopsy testing in preparation for a bone marrow transplant from my other brother Jayson, who is also an alumni of BYUH. Our family has a lot of love for this campus and for the Polynesian Cultural Center. I asked him what does he do to conquer the daily challenge of living with such an illness. He said firstly he is able to handle such a challenge because of his loving, supportive wife and his two beautiful daughters. In other words surrounding himself with the right people to conquer his challenge. He said he is motivated to see them progress in their lives and get married and have families of their own.</p>
<p>This past Christmas my brother and his family visited my parents and I here in Laie. It was interesting. The whole time that he was here in Laie, he functioned so well. The moment they went back to cold Utah, he struggled. I told him that it was the Spirit of the community of Laie. Two of the highlights of his trip were getting to see my parents work in the New Zealand village at the Polynesian Cultural Center and being able to shake hands and visit for a short time with President and Sister Uchtdorf. President Uchtdorf and his wife had been made aware of Wayne’s illness and both said they would pray for him and his family.</p>
<p>Since returning back to Utah, Wayne received a personal letter from President Uchtdorf saying that he would write his name on the Temple prayer roll. Having that experience was just what Wayne needed to undergo his final stages of biopsy testing. My brother is also very diligent and hardworking about taking care of himself consistently by even wearing a mask when is immune system is weak even when it's not an obvious fashion statement. Another thing that Wayne said helps him with his challenge is continuous service despite his circumstances. He told me that there were other people in worse situations that him, which helped him to continue to serve in his ward, with the rugby team, and even looks for opportunities to help others. I deeply admire my brother and the steps he takes daily to conquer his “One Tree Hill”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters it is obvious that we all have our “One Tree Hill” to conquer. However, it is worth noting that we each can conquer our own “One Tree Hill” by surrounding ourselves with the right people, diligently applying and committing ourselves to conquering the challenge daily, and serving in a larger capacity that we have come accustomed too. In doing so I can assure you that you will be able to experience the glorious feeling of achievement and success. My humble plea to you all, is that I hope after today you are able to look at your challenges with renewed positive energy in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers &amp; Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>What an amazing and humbling experience to be here with you today. I have been privileged to spend more than half of my life in this community and working on this campus. It is a special and sacred place. When I was in your seat as a student, I had my ideas of what I wanted to study and do in my life. My declared major was Travel Management. I wanted to work for the airlines and see the world. The Lord in His infinite wisdom guided me to this place where I could do the work He needs me to do; and as it turns out I can actually see the world through all the students and friends I meet who gather to Laie. I love all the cultural experiences we have access to in this microcosm of the world.</p>
<p>During the sesquicentennial celebration of the Pioneers in the Pacific conference held on this campus in 1997, I was at the dedication ceremony for the statue of Jonathan Napela and George Q. Cannon outside this building which bears the name of the latter. The statue was commissioned for that special event to depict the rejoicing of the men responsible for translating the Book of Mormon into the Hawaiian language.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley was officiating the ceremony. After the dedication, he walked in my direction and extended his hand, and calling me by name, greeted me warmly. My heart raced as I heard the prophet of the Lord call me “Kimber”. It was such a thrilling surreal moment and I felt the power in knowing that the Lord and now his prophet too, were mindful of me personally. That wonderful feeling did not diminish even after I realized I had a name badge on. The Spirit bore witness to me in that moment that the Lord knows who I am and doesn’t need a name badge to recognize me.</p>
<p>As a child, I was not naturally athletic. I remember nearly drowning in the shallow end of a pool more than once. At age 10, my closest friends participated in a summer swim team league. I was not up to their level so every morning while they were warming up for team practices, I took beginner swim lessons with a bunch of younger kids to build my confidence and learn how to bob up &amp; down in the water and eventually swim a bit without pinching my nose with one hand while the other arm spun around wildly. The following summer, I determined to join the swim team with my friends. So at age 11, I showed up for the first day of practice, nervous and hoping I remembered how to not drown.</p>
<p>Coach Bobby Fish (no kidding) was a very stern, imposing figure with short dark hair who honestly terrified me. In my mind, the scene that first day resembled the image of frail Prophet Abinadi facing the wicked King Noah. Coach Fish showed no indication of being merciful. I walked onto the pool deck, she sat with heavy arms folded sizing me up from behind darkly shaded glasses, then pointed at the starting block and said one word, "Dive".</p>
<p>So I stepped up to the block which seemed to stand 10-feet above the edge of the pool and somehow put my faith in God and did a feeble flying flop into the pool. Luckily I didn’t hit the bottom and I was able to surface and start swimming as best I could to the other end. The pool seemed to stretch on indefinitely and I quickly grew tired. At last, I reached the other end and in so doing unknowingly passed the required ability test to join the team. This leap of faith turned out to be the beginning of a completely life-changing summer which helped me develop a sense of confidence and self-worth I had never before possessed.</p>
<p>I grew stronger and healthier than ever before that summer and created a vital pillar of strength for my life through swimming. It all started with a desire to learn, putting my trust in God, and a giant leap of faith. Faith building experiences sometimes feel like this type of sink or swim situation but our Heavenly Father is always there for us to buoy us up when needed if we trust in Him.</p>
<p>I first discovered that a BYU campus existed in Hawaii when I was 13-years old and instantly knew this was where I wanted to attend college. I had never been to Hawaii but I knew I was destined to be here. Thankfully I was accepted and when the time came, I was excited and nervous to move to Hawaii. I arrived in Honolulu late at night and was picked up by the “Coconut Express” shuttle sent by BYUHSA along with 3 other students. I just remember sitting in that van watching the city lights turn into pretty much nothing but a blur of bushes and darkness on the long ride to campus. I wondered about the sanity of my decision to come here for I felt completely isolated and desolate at first but the Holy Spirit reassured and helped me get through it and now, 26 years later I’m still here and loving my island home.</p>
<p>Since I was determined to work hard and pay my way through school without incurring any long-term debt, one of the first orders of business once I got here was to get a job. I applied for several jobs on campus and at the Polynesian Cultural Center and was turned down for all of them. I had lots of previous job experience and was a dependable worker so it just wasn’t adding up for me. The last straw was when I was denied a custodial job at PCC. I thought that I must be beyond hopeless if I’m not qualified to scrub toilets for minimum wage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in when Nephi broke his bow of fine steel, I had to humble myself and work harder to find a way to support myself. I was just lucky I didn’t have to deal with starvation and murmuring family members like he did. Several weeks into the semester a job opened up at the School of Business. I was more suited to this position than any of the others I had applied for and was offered the job. I felt humbled at my impatience and lack of trust in my Heavenly Father’s plan for me.</p>
<p>The School of Business was a wonderful job and I learned many valuable skills but I had to prove myself before the blessings started to come. My supervisor spoke fluent pidgin and not much else so I had to quickly learn how to decipher “da kine” multiple times in any given sentence. I was blessed with the gift of tongues and learned how to listen to and understand her instructions. We became good friends and I worked there as a student secretary for nearly 4-years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To trust in God, we have to learn for ourselves how to listen to his guidance and what His voice sounds like to us individually. During my second year of college at the fall opening social for the Tahitian Club, I met a brand new student. He was just off his mission and fresh off the boat with a radical farmer’s tan. At the social this new student with a thick accent kept asking me to dance all night. I learned that his name was Ramond but not much else because all he did was listen to me and smile or agree with everything I said. I was enrolled in French 101 that semester; Ramond was in EIL 101 just learning English basics so he was very kind to help me practice speaking French with him. The first time he called me on the phone he actually read a script his roommate had written out for him and then would repeat anything I asked him so his friend, like in the story of Cyrano de Bergerac, could tell him what to say in response. I had no idea this was going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>English is Ramond’s third language and his elocution was still pretty sparse when he first arrived but with help and encouragement form his mission president, he passed the Admissions criteria with help from on-high and we ended up becoming friends and regular study buddies. As a result, we both improved in our foreign language studies.</p>
<p>Within a year we were engaged to be married. We requested to have Ramond’s father, who is a sealer in the Papeete Tahiti Temple, perform our sealing ceremony here in the Laie Hawaii Temple. A petition had to be approved by the First Presidency to allow him to exercise his authority in a different temple. To our utter surprise and disappointment, the petition was denied. For me, it caused some second thoughts about what kind of sign we were receiving and if we had made the right choice.</p>
<p>After several days of sincere prayer about what to do, we were walking together one evening when, through a window, Ramond saw into a room filled with people we didn’t know, many of whom were not observing the BYUH Dress and Grooming standards. Immediately Ramond received an impression that he was supposed to ask one of the men in the room if he would be our sealer. I was obviously not paying as much attention to the Spirit as he was because surveying the group I just said, "Sure, you go ahead and do that.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not brave enough to walk up to a total stranger and ask him if he was an LDS Temple Sealer, but Ramond was because the Spirit prompted him and he listened and trusted in the Lord to guide him. I sheepishly followed behind at a distance as he raced through the crowd and caught up to the man who was already walking out to his car. By the time I caught up to them, they had already established that the man was indeed a temple sealer and he had agreed to perform our ceremony for us. The experience that night was exactly what I needed as an indisputable answer to my prayers if our decision to be married was right for us. My confidence in our decision had returned yet it was still a confusing disappointment to have been denied the opportunity to be sealed by my future father-in-law. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our beloved President Hinckley shared this wise counsel as a reminder to continually trust in the Lord even in the midst of our trials:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It isn’t as bad as you sometimes think it is.</p>
<p>It all works out. Don’t worry.</p>
<p>I say that to myself every morning.</p>
<p>It will all work out.</p>
<p>Put your trust in God,</p>
<p>and move forward with faith</p>
<p>and confidence in the future.</p>
<p>The Lord will not forsake us.</p>
<p>He will not forsake us.</p>
<p>If we will put our trust in Him,</p>
<p>if we will pray to Him,</p>
<p>if we will live worthy of His blessings,</p>
<p>He will hear our prayers.”<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>What a tender mercy the Lord showed me by saying no to our petition as I eventually came to understand the wisdom in the First Presidency's decision. My Father-in-law speaks only in Tahitian and French so the ceremony would have been performed in a language not familiar to most in attendance. I had completed a total of 3-years of high school and college French classes but admittedly it would have been very difficult for me to understand the sacred ceremony with my rudimentary classroom French vocabulary. What a blessing it was to have both of our fathers there as witnesses to our sealing and to have the crystal-clear loving counsel of our sealer, Thomas Kekaula, who is someone who will remain very dear to us forever.</p>
<p>The first car we owned as newlyweds was what is affectionately known as a “Laie car”. It had spent many years on campus being passed through numerous owners by the time we bought it for a whopping $250. If you own a car with that sort of price tag, please understand the reason they call them “Laie cars” is because they should not be driven outside of Laie, if at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, one morning Brother Brothers and I were driving to pick-up a new student arriving from Tahiti at the airport. Half-way through the Wilson Tunnel on the Like Like Highway, we heard a loud bang under the hood immediately followed by torrents of white smoke streaming out from the engine. &nbsp;We feared it was about to ignite and we would be going out in a blaze of glory. &nbsp;However, we made it to the top of the tunnel and pulled over to find it was a radiator hose which had exploded and spewed the contents of the radiator all over the engine thus creating all the smoke.</p>
<p>This was still in the BC years “before cellular” so we had no phone and no idea what to do. So we did the only thing we could, we prayed a mighty prayer then tried to turn the engine back on. It worked. We pulled the car around, took a deep breath, and headed back into the tunnel with the car in neutral and our faith on turbo the whole way down the mountain. At the bottom intersection, the light which was always red was miraculously green despite no other cars coming down before or after us. We coasted through the intersection and turned into the first neighborhood we could where suddenly the car’s engine just stopped. Then we finally exhaled and said a prayer of gratitude.</p>
<p>Conveniently, there was a man standing in the carport right where we stalled who was wrapping lau lau at 6 am on a Sunday for some reason. He let us use his phone and get the help we needed to get our Laie car repaired and back home. The new student waiting at the airport caught a ride with someone else and we had a great laugh about it later.</p>
<p>You would have thought we learned our lesson about trusting a Laie car but we were poor desperate students and had to put our trust in the Lord several more times with that car before it was towed off into car heaven. We were blessed over and over because of our faith and trust in the Lord. Trusting is a delicate matter. Placing our trust in the three members of the Godhead is sure and good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, trust by nature is intangible and must be tested and proved. Take the experiences of Job, a righteous and respected man who certainly did not deserve the hardships placed upon him. By mortal standards, he had every reason to doubt and murmur against God. Yet he trusted in God even as his family, health, wealth, and reputation were taken from him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His friends questioned him and assumed the worst of him yet he remained meek and humble. He recognized his weaknesses found even greater humility and recognition of the Lord saying, “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s common to trust that promised blessings will come when we think we need them most rather than waiting on the Lord’s time and His plan for us. For almost a decade after being married, Brother Brothers and I still had not been blessed with a child. In fact, we had several pregnancies end in dramatic fashion requiring surgery and hospitalization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time the promises of motherhood in Priesthood blessings I had received became harder to understand. After losing our fourth baby, I lost my patience, my hope, my faith, I had nearly lost my life, I was in utter misery and a deep dark depression. I was angry with God because I was sure He had turned His back on me, so I turned mine on Him and shut out everyone and everything. It was what I imagine outer darkness feels like, completely removed from the presence of God. I remained in that despondent state for two nights until I came to my senses and admitted I needed help. In the very second I called out His name in prayer, I felt the overwhelming love and light of my Savior envelop me and melt away my misery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt the power of the Comforter and I’m sure many angels surrounding me. I was shocked at how quickly and how powerfully my answer for help came. He did not take away the sorrow but did help me through it. As it turns out, our path to parenthood came through the selfless sacrifice of amazing birth mothers who lovingly brought our two beautiful adopted children into the world. Their selfless love for these precious souls and trust in us to raise them is humbling and inspiring. God fulfilled His promises to bless my husband and I with the opportunity to be the parents of these two choice children.</p>
<p>Now for a bit of sobering reality, there are very real threats we must overcome in order to prove our trust and faith in God. We cannot pretend to be exempt or immune from the buffetings of Satan. He is ever at the door pressing his way in.</p>
<p>Well over 100 years ago in 1894 President Wilford Woodruff shared:</p>
<p>“God has held the angels of destruction for many years, lest they should reap down the wheat with the tares. But I want to tell you now, that those angels have left the portals of heaven, and they stand over this people and this nation now, and are hovering over the earth waiting to pour out the judgments. And from this very day they shall be poured out. Calamities and troubles are increasing in the earth, and there is a meaning to these things.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I believe that meaning spoken of is for us to be proved and to learn to trust in the Lord. As a personal professional caveat when it comes to trusting, we should all be aware by now that the world we are living in is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>Part of my job deals with security and system access. In the IT support profession, we have seen a skyrocketing increase in virtual threats. Most of those threats are filtered and removed before they can cause harm but every once in a while, a well-crafted message may sneak through and beguile unsuspecting recipients. The invitation to “Click here” should not be taken lightly. Even when you know the sender or the site, you should not automatically trust that the source is authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must watch and be vigilant to not fall victim to the scams and works of the adversary by being too trusting and gullible. There are far too many cunning hackers whose only aim is to disrupt and rob you of your privacy, money, credit, &amp; peace of mind. We must always use caution, think twice, and trust the promptings you receive through the Holy Spirit before you press that “Click here” link. Remember the warning in the Proverbs written by King Solomon, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>While preparing for a primary lesson recently, I was impressed by a simple principle in the lesson that in fact, God trusts each of us. God trusts me. That thought had not so clearly crossed my mind before.</p>
<p>Why should God trust in me? Well, I am His child. He created me in His image and He gave me a conscience to help me know right from wrong, good from evil. God trusts all His children. He has given commandments which are within our ability to accomplish, so why shouldn’t he trust us to follow them? He wants us to succeed more than anyone. He is always willing to help us make course corrections to get back on the straight and narrow path. He gives us the opportunity to hit the reset button weekly with the sacred sacrament ordinance to start over with a clean slate. All we must do is exercise the gift of sincere repentance to receive the blessings of the atonement.</p>
<p>What has God trusted us to do in this life? He trusts us to bear the name of His Son and stand as witnesses of Him at all times and in all things and in all places. He is counting on us to share the gospel with all the world to prepare for the return of His Beloved Son. He trusts us to do everything we can to thwart the efforts of Satan to bring His children down into misery. He trusts each of us to use the gifts He blesses us with for good purposes.He is counting on us to love Him and our neighbors and ourselves. He gives us callings and responsibilities to help us do that. He gives us the Holy Spirit's promptings to help us know His will for us personally. He trusts us to be His hands upon the earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Kim B. Clark shared a thought in a talk on this campus many years ago that has stuck with me. What I took away was the concept that merely “sprinkling ourselves” with the gospel, meaning skipping daily scripture study and prayer, picking and choosing which precepts to follow, skipping meetings, not fulfilling our duties, and __fill in your own blank__, only gives you enough knowledge to feel guilty. There is diluted joy in living the gospel half way.</p>
<p>If we wish to experience the full measure of joy the Lord promises, it comes as a result of our diving in with full immersion or dedicated discipleship and service to others. God trusts us to act upon His promptings, put our priorities in order, and to do what is right.</p>
<p>A beautiful reminder of what matters most in this life comes from the poem Treasure In Heaven - by John Godfrey Saxe:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Every coin of earthly treasure</p>
<p>We have lavished, upon earth,</p>
<p>For our simple worldly pleasure,</p>
<p>May be reckoned something worth;</p>
<p>For the spending was not losing,</p>
<p>Though the purchase were but small;</p>
<p>It has perished with the using;</p>
<p>We have had it- that is all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the gold we leave behind us</p>
<p>When we turn to dust again</p>
<p>(Though our avarice may blind us),</p>
<p>We have gathered quite in vain;</p>
<p>Since we neither can direct it,</p>
<p>By the winds of fortune tossed,</p>
<p>Nor in other worlds expect it;</p>
<p>What we hoarded, we have lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But each merciful oblation-&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Seed of pity wisely sown),</p>
<p>What we gave in self-negation,</p>
<p>We may safely call our own;</p>
<p>For the treasure freely given</p>
<p>Is the treasure that we hoard,</p>
<p>Since the angels keep in Heaven</p>
<p>What is lent unto the Lord!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way God teaches us about trust is through the law of the tithe. I have seen the miracles that paying my tithing brings. The blessings associated with obedience to this law are easily overlooked, like having enough food to eat, shelter, transportation, and employment. I have found that obeying the law of tithing is easier when I pay my tithing first, then I always find a way to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Brother Brothers and I were tight on funds and had to make a decision between paying our tithing or putting the money towards the adoption of our second child. Both were righteous and worthy uses for the money. We could not do both so we decided to prove the Lord, pay our tithing, and trust that everything would work out. A few days after paying our tithing, we received an unexpected refund check in the mail. We had been overcharged for something and the money was being returned to us. The amount was slightly more than the sum we had given in tithing. God keeps his promises when we obey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma’s testimony to his son promised, “...that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>By obeying His commandments, we are promised great treasures of knowledge, health, and salvation.<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup> Promised blessings are available now and extend into the eternities for those who faithfully believe in and follow Christ’s example and who “Trust in God.”</p>
<p>I share my testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel and of the love and trust that exists for each of us from on high. These things I say humbly in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>24 January 2017<br />Bruce C. Hafen<br />Emeritus General Authority<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sister Hafen</p>
<p>The two of us met years ago as students in a BYU religion class called “Your Religious Problems.” &nbsp;We both solved our biggest “religious problem” when our friendship from that class blossomed into our marriage. For each class, a student would pick a religious question, &nbsp;do research on it, then lead a discussion. We each wrote a short paper on how we would resolve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the students looked at criticisms of Joseph Smith or Church history issues, others looked at doctrine, and some just wondered how to live the gospel better. It was a blessing to explore these questions with each other in an attitude of mutual trust. Our teacher, West Belnap, then BYU’s Dean of Religion, often let us struggle. He wanted us to reach our own conclusions. Yet he knew just when and how to guide us with an occasional nudge. That class helped opened our eyes about our topic for today-- “faith is not blind.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our experiences since then include Bruce’s service as President of BYU-Idaho, then Dean of the BYU Law School, then the second-in-command at BYU. Incidentally, both President and Sister Tanner were students in Bruce’s BYU Book of Mormon classes. I also taught English part-time at BYU when President Tanner was on that English faculty, &nbsp;and I served on the &nbsp;Young Women General Board a few years before Sister Tanner served in that presidency. We have long admired and loved the Tanners. Bruce served as a General Authority from 1996 to 2010, including our four memorable years in the Pacific Islands and Australia. We also recently served as President and Matron of the St. George Temple. And sprinkled through the years, the Lord has blessed us with seven children and a Pacific-sized boatload of grandchildren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Elder Hafen</p>
<p>During their growing up years, most LDS teenagers tend to think about the gospel and life with a kind of black-and-white simplicity that we might call “the ideal.” They have a childlike optimism that makes them wonderfully teachable. They trust their parents and their teachers, and they tend to believe what they read. They love EFY. Later on, they love their YSA ward, and they all love getting “likes” on their Facebook pages. In some ways, life at that age is all about getting “likes” and smiley faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, however, experience usually introduces a new dimension, as we discover a kind of gap between the ideal and the real, between what ought to be and what is. Think of two circles, one inside the other. The inner boundary is “the real,” or what is. The outer boundary is “the ideal,” or what ought to be. We stand at the inner boundary of reality, reaching out and trying to pull reality—or ourselves--closer to our lofty ideals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We first see the distance between these two boundaries when we notice some things about ourselves or other Church members that aren’t quite what we expected. For example, even at BYU-Hawaii, a brand new student can feel lost and intimidated. Or maybe he brushes up against a faculty member whose attitudes about the Church are more liberal—or more conservative—than he had expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when we become acquainted at an adult level with those who have been our heroes, we might begin to see their human limitations. For instance, maybe one of our parents disappoints us in some way. Or we might see a Church leader forget an important meeting or lose his cool when he’s feeling stressed. At a more personal level, perhaps we pray for needed help, and the answer just doesn’t come in the ways the scriptures seem to promise. Or we suffer a surprise setback with good health, or we bump into an unexpected conflict with a close friend or family member.</p>
<p>Much social interaction among LDS young adults takes place at the “ideal” level, &nbsp;because people are trying so hard to look and be at their best. And in both dating and marriage relationships, it is easy to assume that any returned missionary who has a temple recommend won’t have real personal challenges. But in fact, almost nobody’s “real” is in every detail equal to his or her “ideal.” &nbsp;After all, God gave each of us weaknesses that we may be humble. Each of us is a work in progress. So in our desire to find and marry an &nbsp;ideal person, the distance between the real and the ideal can complicate the way we think about others—or how we think about ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We might also run across information we haven’t heard before about Joseph Smith or Brigham Young. Or we may encounter something posted on the Internet that challenges our beliefs or raises questions we don’t know how to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such experiences can unsettle us, and we yearn for simpler times, when life seemed more clear. We might find ourselves becoming a little skeptical or we question someone in authority. Not everyone will encounter these things, but as we grow and increase our awareness, most of us do run into some uncertainty or ambiguity.</p>
<p>The gospel’s basic teachings are clear and certain. But even some scriptures can seem ambiguous. For example, the story of Nephi and Laban can be challenging until we see how one man could indeed cause a nation to dwindle in unbelief. Or think about Peter on the night he denied knowing his Master three times. Was Peter simply a coward, or—as President Spencer W. Kimball once asked—might the Lord have asked Peter to deny Him to preserve Peter’s future leadership of the Church?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in one scripture the Lord said He can’t look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> Yet elsewhere he said, “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> Justice is indeed a divine law, but so is the doctrine of mercy. At times these two principles can seem inconsistent, until reconciled by the higher doctrine of the Atonement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, in just the last few years, we have seen laws and attitudes about gay marriage change with stunning speed, profoundly unsettling our culture, the Church, and for many of us, unsettling some important relationships. For centuries, society’s “ideal” norms on this subject were consistent with gospel teachings—and nearly everyone accepted the ideal, even while also supporting the “real” struggles of friends who were experiencing same-sex attraction. But now that the real has been legally re-defined as the ideal, the gospel’s unchanged definition of the ideal can seem to twist in the harsh wind of social disapproval.</p>
<p>So as we grow in experience, we will probably encounter some distance between the ideal and the real. Let’s call it “the gap.” We can see the gap in our personal experience, in our Church experience, in the scriptures, and in just trying to survive in today’s world. Indeed, some degree of uncertainty in managing that gap is actually part of the mortal plan, as symbolized by the mists of darkness in Lehi’s dream. Some parts of mortality are certain and clear, of course, as symbolized by the iron rod. But the distance between where we are and where we want to be—the “gap”of uncertainty--remains. Let’s talk now about three different levels in dealing with that gap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At level one, some people simply don’t see a gap. Their perceptions somehow filter out the differences between the real and the ideal. For them, the gospel at its best is a firm handshake, a high five, and a smiley face. Their mission was the best, their ward is the best, and every new day will probably be the best day they ever had. These cheerful ones are optimistic, spontaneous, and relaxed. They can weather many storms that seem formidable to more pessimistic types, perhaps because they have missed hearing that a storm is going on.</p>
<p>Another group at level one sees the gap, but they eliminate the distance between what is and what ought to be by, in effect, erasing the inner circle of reality—thus appearing to remove the gap. They cling to the ideal so single-mindedly that they just don’t feel the discomfort that would come from facing the real facts about themselves, about others, or about the world around them. These innocent ones may be unable to perceive perfection and imperfection at the same time. Or maybe they are just too naïve or too stubborn. Or perhaps the gap asks questions that are too raw, pushing them into denial, which lets them filter out painful realities.</p>
<p>When we don’t see the gap or we focus only on the ideal while blocking out the real, our perspective lacks depth. We will think we understand things too quickly, and we won’t be prepared for adversity. Then strong winds can blow us over, because our roots haven’t sunk far enough into the soil of experience to establish a firm foundation. We need to learn how to face uncomfortable realities in order to grow. Therefore, the Lord not only comforts the afflicted; sometimes He afflicts the comfortable.</p>
<p>Let us move up, then, to level two where we at least see “things as they really are,” both the real and the ideal. Only then can we begin to deal with reality in a constructive way. And when the shafts of adversity hit us, we won’t be living on borrowed light. If we don’t grapple with the frustration that comes from facing bravely the uncertainties we encounter, we will lack spiritual maturity. If we don’t see the problems that exist, we won’t be able to help solve them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, despite the value of a level two awareness, one’s acceptance of the clouds of uncertainty can become so complete that the iron rod fades into the receding mist, and skepticism becomes not just a helpful tool, but a guiding philosophy. This perspective comes from erasing the outer circle of the ideal and focusing only on the inner circle of reality. At level one, the inexperienced person seems to have all of the answers but just doesn’t know what the questions are. At level two, that same person, perhaps as shallow as before, can have all of the questions, but none of the answers. A little learning, as valuable as that is, can be dangerous. And the ability to acknowledge ambiguity is not the final form of enlightenment.</p>
<p>People who take too much delight in their new level two tools of skepticism and analysis sometimes try out their tools in a Church classroom or in conversations with family or friends. They may delight in cross-examination of the unsuspecting, just looking for somebody’s idealistic bubble floating around so they can pop it with their shiny new pin of skepticism. But when we pop those bubbles, we can lose harmony, trust, and the Spirit. We need to look longer and harder at difficult questions and pat answers, but we can’t let our attitude just lurch from extreme innocence to extreme skepticism. Today’s world is full of hard-core skeptics who love to burst the bubbles of those who are stuck in level one, cynically offering them doubt and agnosticism at level two as a seemingly brave new way of life. <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>I once learned a great lesson about how being overly realistic can inhibit the workings of the Spirit. I had been on my mission in Germany about a year when I was assigned to train a brand new missionary named Elder Keeler. One day when I was away at a leadership meeting, he and another new elder met a pleasant woman at the door but they didn’t know enough German to talk with her. Yet, he said he felt a strong spiritual impression that she would someday join the Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, he was so excited about her that he forgot to write down her name—or her address. He knew only that her apartment was on the fifth floor—somewhere in the middle of our huge, high-rise tracting area. He was sure he’d recognize her name next to the doorbell, so the next day we dashed up and down polished staircases for hours, but couldn’t find her. When I said we needed to go back to work, his lower lip began to tremble. He said, “but the Spirit really spoke to me about that woman.” I muttered that maybe the Spirit was telling him to write down the name and address.</p>
<p>Well, to teach him a lesson, I raced him up some more staircases. And then, about an hour later, we found her -- Renate Wolfart. Forty years later, Marie and I were with Renate, her husband Friedrich, and all four of their children and spouses in the Frankfurt Temple. Friedrich, now a temple sealer, sealed their youngest daughter and her husband. That’s a lesson I can never forget: never erase that outer “ideal” circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sister Hafen</p>
<p>So the best response to the gap of uncertainty is at level three, where we see both the real and the ideal, not only with our eyes wide open, but also with our hearts wide open as well. We can do that, even when we’d like more evidence before choosing exactly what to do. This may mean accepting a Church calling when we’re feeling too busy to take on more duties. Or it may mean that we follow the First Presidency’s counsel even when we don’t understand the reasons behind their counsel. It means we will give the Lord and His Church the benefit of our doubts or unanswered questions. The choice to be believing at this level is very different from mere blind obedience. It is, rather, a knowing and loving kind of obedience. And instead of asking us to put aside the tools of an educated critical mind, this third level invites us to use those tools to make the status quo better, not just to criticize it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate moving through all three levels, I’ll tell you about Holly. At age 18, Holly was very active in the Church but in an “auto pilot” kind of way. Then someone persuaded her that women ought to hold the priesthood. She was so convinced by this idea that she indignantly resigned her Church membership. A few years later, her college roommate was taking the missionary lessons. Holly decided to sit in. Her heart was touched, and she decided to pray for the first time in years. As soon as she said the words, “Heavenly Father…” she began to cry. Her frosted heart melted. She felt a real relationship with God that she hadn’t known before. She called it “the closeness.” &nbsp;A little later Holly was re-baptized. As she studied and prayed, her “closeness” to Him deepened. Stubborn attitudes grew into trust. Then she said, “The women and the priesthood issue? That doesn’t bother me anymore. I trust Him. He knows what He’s doing.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Elder Hafen</p>
<p>Understanding these three levels in dealing with uncertainty can help us solve all kinds of problems. This model applies to many realms of personal discovery and growth. But for today, let’s just apply it to dealing with criticism of the Church in the Internet age. Here’s a true story about a friend from Europe whom I’ll call Mattias. After his mission and temple marriage, Mattias raised a beautiful family. He became a stake president. Later after I’d come to know him well, I saw a prominent American news story reporting that Mattias was “grappling with a wave of doubt and disillusionment” because he had “encountered information on the Internet that sabotaged” his religious faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the reporter asked what had happened, Mattias said that for years as a Church member and leader, he’d been “living in a bubble and we felt so happy.” &nbsp; Then some of his LDS &nbsp;friends came to him for answers to questions they had encountered on the Internet. He said many of the issues were new to him—such as, how did Joseph Smith translate the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham, why were blacks excluded from the priesthood until 1978, and did Joseph Smith really practice polygamy. Mattias’s problem was not with what had happened in each instance, once he learned the details. Rather, he was distressed that he hadn’t previously known these things, so he felt betrayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I knew and cared a great deal about Mattias, I wondered how these questions could have surprised him. My experience had been so different from his. Marie told you about our BYU class, “Your Religious Problems,” where we learned that asking gospel questions can be a productive way to learn—if we move through all of the three levels we’ve just discussed. We encountered Mattias’s questions years ago—not because we were digging into secret historical closets, but because we and our friends had what felt like a normal college experience for LDS students. In the Church classrooms where we’ve sat ever since, these issues were not hidden or discouraged. On the contrary, we have often discussed them, always in an open atmosphere of faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember when Mattias said that before these questions came to his attention, “I was just in a bubble, and we felt so happy?” &nbsp;That sentence is actually a good illustration of level one idealism in the steps of dealing with uncertainty. Holly, so active that she was on auto-pilot, at first lived in the same bubble. Then the shock of bumping into level two realism felt to both Mattias and Holly like an earthquake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wasn’t really their fault—or perhaps anybody’s fault. Their experience may just tell us that in this day of both the Internet and the international Church, we need to do a better job of introducing our children, young people, new converts, and others to the process of learning and applying the levels of dealing with uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For several decades now, the Church has felt an understandable need to simplify its curriculum, magazines, and other materials so that inexperienced Church members in many cultures can understand them. Because of the common-denominator limitations of that approach, I cheered in the early 1990s when the world-renowned Macmillan Company published the Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Those four impressive volumes contain scores of careful articles by qualified LDS authors on all the topics Mattias mentioned, and many others. It has been widely available ever since—it’s been on the Internet for years. I don’t know why Mattias didn’t know about it. If he had, he might have avoided what happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At level three we are not just optimists and not just pessimists. We are open-minded believers who know that history and life are not always clear-cut and tidy, but our desire is to keep learning and to improve the status quo, not just to criticize it. Let’s consider four suggestions for applying our mature level three perspective to Church critics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First suggestion: A kind word for faithful questions. Having a curious mind is one of the pathways to understanding and growth. However, there may be some who mistakenly assume that LDS culture disapproves of people who wonder. So when we &nbsp;have honest questions, some of us may feel unfaithful or even guilty. Is it wrong to wonder? &nbsp;I don’t think so. Seeking answers and deeper understanding really can help us grow. As J.R.R. Tolkien said, “not all those who wander are lost.” &nbsp; So let us welcome questions and questioners. Otherwise we could imply that we have something to hide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember when Mattias said he’d been living happily in a bubble? &nbsp; If he was, it was not because the Church consciously imposed that mindset to keep him in the dark. His bubble was nothing more complicated than the innocent perspective and habits of gliding along at level one, not realizing that we can grow out of that simplistic world of black and white. Let us move on to the more realistic realm of level two, where we can see life in living color, with rich meanings that we must sometimes search to discover. Then we’ll keep growing into the honest and faithful perspective of level three, where we won’t let the questions we don’t yet understand get in the way of the fundamental truths that we do understand.</p>
<p>As you move on to level three, remember that becoming a doubting Thomas is not the end goal of discipleship. Being realistic is better than not seeing reality, but &nbsp;level two realism can easily become a rigid pessimism that also blocks the search for truth. We don’t want to be so closed-minded that we look at the world through a soda straw. But we also don’t want to be so open-minded that our brains fall out. Or as President Uchtdorf put it, “doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Having a believing heart rather than a doubtful heart is in some sense a matter of personal choice about our attitude. The Lord counsels us gently in D&amp;C 6, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.” And in D&amp;C 90 He encouraged us to give Him the benefit of our doubts this way: “search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things will work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, the Church has posted some useful new “gospel topics essays” on lds.org. These new essays are more visible than the more complete versions of these and many other topics in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism. I hope they will help people notice some of what Mattias missed seeing. That increased visibility also sends a message about the value, in today’s wide-open world, of having open minds and open hearts based on a prepared stance that is as wise as a serpent yet as harmless as a dove. As LDS scholar Terryl Givens said, “There is not a single instance in Mormon history where a fuller version delivered honestly and forthrightly, with [advance] preparation, will not utterly disarm, or drastically soften, the effect of anti-Mormon writing.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sister Hafen</p>
<p>Second suggestion: &nbsp;be cautious about the Internet’s weaknesses as a source of information about the Church. In our student days, anti-Mormon writing was usually buried in hard-to-find places. To track it down, we had to do library research on each specific topic. And other people who quoted anti-Mormon writing were usually those who had some complaint against the Church, but their arguments were seldom convincing enough to earn serious visibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the Internet’s great blessings, yet one of its curses, is that it gives everyone--regardless of age or qualifications--unfiltered access to unlimited information. All of that data--regardless of how reliable it actually is--can seem to have equal credibility. This lets the bloggers at the extreme ends of any spectrum seem as qualified to speak as if they were established experts. After all, their names are right there on Google, just like the real rocket scientists—or sometimes instead of the real rocket scientists.</p>
<p>This unfiltered access offers great advantages—but it also invites grave dangers. It may take real effort to check the accuracy and motives of a website’s authors, and we seldom have a Brother Belnap nearby to answer our questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When one friend was struggling with something he found on-line, we asked if he had also read the work of reliable LDS scholars on BYU, Church, or other trustworthy websites. “Oh I can’t trust those people,” he said, “because they are already biased in favor of the Church.” &nbsp;We replied, “Don’t you think the sponsors of negative websites have a bias against the Church?” &nbsp;Virtually everything on-line, including Wikipedia, reflects somebody’s bias. And the last thing the negative sites will disclose is the bias of their sponsors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another risk of unfiltered access is that readers can’t know which critical claims have already been discredited. The negative sites’ sponsors certainly aren’t going to tell us. Actually, sophisticated research by LDS scholars has now responded thoroughly to the main criticisms about Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, the Book of Mormon, and other historical issues. It would be highly ironic if the Internet is producing more casualties from Church critics now, in this day--when the Church’s scholarly credibility has never been higher and access to original Church documents has never been more open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third suggestion: let’s focus on the hugely positive doctrinal content of the Restoration, rather than becoming sidetracked with the details of how Joseph received that content. That big picture perspective is central to life at level three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone told us he was troubled by questions about how Joseph Smith translated the books of Mormon, Moses, and Abraham. As we listened to him, we thought of the championship golf course at the foot of the magnificent Grand Teton mountains in Wyoming. Imagine a golfer there who spends most of his time looking for lost golf balls in the rough—without even noticing the magnificent mountains. The content—the doctrine and ideas—in those precious books of scripture make me want to plead with my friend, “Don’t lose your way wandering in the rough with your eyes down. Lift up your eyes and see the majestic mountains of truth the Lord gave us through Joseph.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we assume that Joseph Smith “translated” scriptures the way a scholar would, we misunderstand his role as a Seer. He never said exactly how he translated, but it was clearly a revelatory process. The Encyclopedia of Mormonism tells us that “[I]t was principally divine inspiration rather than [Joseph’s] knowledge of languages that produced the English text of the book of Abraham. His precise methodology remains unknown.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> That is also true of the Book of Mormon—translated simply “by the gift and Power of God.” &nbsp;But Joseph also told us: “Could you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>And as Richard Bushman wrote, “Unlike the scholarly translators, [Joseph] went back beyond the existing texts to the minds of the prophets, and through them to the mind of God.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup> So Joseph apparently could connect to the original sources from which all other scripture had come, a window into the entire heavenly realm—perhaps the same window through which Moses, Nephi, and John the Revelator saw. The pure and profound doctrines he found there revolutionized Christianity, restoring a true understanding of the nature of God and our relationship with Him; the nature of man—past, present, and future; the Fall, the Atonement, the scriptures, and the very purpose of life. This astounding religious bedrock rings with such glorious truth that it speaks for itself—with such profound clarity that the details of how the Lord gave it to Joseph matters little.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Elder Hafen</p>
<p>Fourth suggestion: cultivate an attitude of meekness. When our idealism has been rattled by abrupt confrontations with realism, our attitude about what has happened is more important than what has happened. Elder Maxwell said that doubting “can either soften or harden hearts, depending on [our] supply of meekness.” Meekness, a softness of heart, keeps the seed of faith alive. When we let adversity harden our hearts, we choke the seed. But if we meekly retain our desire to believe—the attitude that first activated our experiment with the word--our believing heart lets the seed thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when we are jolted by hard experiences, we have a choice. We can either close our hearts to God in bitterness or open our hearts to Him in contrition. By choosing to have a contrite spirit, we bring our whole souls to God and give Him something to work with. As Jacob wrote, without that meek humility, the Lord will “not open unto” us, &nbsp;and “the happiness which is prepared for the saints” will be “hid from [us] forever.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Here’s what that meekness looks like--another missionary story. We were teaching a bright young American couple named Paul and Wendy Knaupp. They had read and believed the Book of Mormon and were eagerly preparing for baptism. Then Paul’s family wrote him a letter warning him that Mormons were racist, because they didn’t grant their lay priesthood to African men. He and Wendy felt hurt and betrayed. Why hadn’t someone told them about this? Didn’t we know that God treats all people equally? Yet they were bewildered, because they had felt sure that Joseph was a prophet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was speechless. This was 1962. I had never heard a serious discussion about race and the priesthood, let alone an explanation. But, recalling some fragment from my recent personal scripture study, I blurted out, “Let’s read the story of Peter and Cornelius in Acts Chapter 10.” &nbsp;Here we read that after centuries of restricting the gospel to blood Israel, the Lord revealed to Peter that it was time to share the Savior’s message with the Gentile world. This made it reasonable to think that sometime He would open that same door even more fully—which He did in 1978, when he revealed to President Kimball that it was time to establish the Church—and holy temples—everywhere, for the first time in history.</p>
<p>A short time later, Paul and Wendy called to say they had prayed earnestly and wanted to keep talking. Soon they were baptized and eventually raised their family of five children in the gospel. Years later Wendy told me she didn’t remember anything we had discussed on that pivotal night. She just said that after our visit, the gloom had gradually left them and the light returned. Like Nephi, Paul and Wendy had sensed only that God “loveth his children,” even if they didn’t “know the meaning of all things.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> They were meek and spiritually alive enough to know that the Lord loved them, so they trusted Him. They wouldn’t let the things they didn’t yet understand get in the way of the wonderful truths they did understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I offer a concluding perspective now from Oliver Wendell Holmes, who described our three level process this way: “I would not give a fig for the simplicity [on] this side of complexity. But I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity.” &nbsp; The simplicity on this side of complexity is level one. Complexity is level two. And on the other side of complexity is the hard-earned, new simplicity of level three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. I recently attended an LDS testimony meeting for the women inmates at the Utah State Prison—women separated from their families and from society by serious crimes and serious struggles. One of them said, “When I was a little girl, I often bore my testimony in Church. In my innocent little sing-song voice I would say, ‘I love my mom and dad. I know the Church is true. My Heavenly Father loves me. Jesus suffered for my sins.’ &nbsp;But today, behind these bars, I am saying those same words with new eyes and a new heart. Now I understand what the words really mean. I know the Church is true. My Heavenly Father loves me. Jesus suffered for my sins.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>She was discovering the simplicity on the other side of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplicity on this side of complexity asks very little of us. The simplicity on the other side of complexity asks everything of us. That’s why Holmes would give his life for it. T.S. Eliot called this, “A condition of complete simplicity/ (Costing not less than everything).”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may need to pay that cost in multiple ways. For instance, we don’t always move smoothly and quickly through complexity to ‘other side’ simplicity. Too many get stuck in complexity. And because complexity is more nuanced and realistic than level one simplicity, some bright people may think that mere complexity is better informed, more honest. Others may think that’s all there is, or that they can’t get out. But remember what Holmes said--moving beyond complexity to mature simplicity is so important that he would give his life to find it. So getting there can be a matter of spiritual life and death. That means it will probably require great sacrifice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our friend Holly discovered this level three simplicity after she left the Church then found it again, with fresh, more open eyes. She had come to know complexity, with its conflicts and demands, but now she was meek enough to sense that complexity alone is not enough. Complexity is but the texture, the contrasts, and the oppositions that give context and meaning to our choices and experiences. In that context, she heard the Restoration’s message with new ears. Then she tasted the simplicity beyond complexity when she spoke those simple but holy words with a new voice: “Heavenly Father.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discoveries like Holly’s are not small ones. They are part of the cosmic pattern of Adam and Eve, who left the simplicity of Eden for the complexity that began with the forbidden fruit. Then they gradually came to themselves, discovering that because of their encounters with complexity their eyes were opened, and if they would repent and call upon God, they could now grasp the joy of full simplicity. They would not then return to the innocent simplicity of Eden but would ascend developmentally toward mature celestial life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of Christ’s Atonement, they could learn from their complexity without being confused or condemned by it. In this life they would have joy and would be with Him again. And then they would truly comprehend for the first time the grand simplicity of being with Him and with each other—a fullness of meaning they would never have found in the simple innocence of Eden. In Elliot’s words, “We shall not cease from exploration./ And the end of all our exploring/ Will be to arrive where we started/ And know the place for the first time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, as we make our way through our complexities, if we don’t press forward by giving the Lord and His Church the benefit of our doubts and uncertainties, it won’t be long until we are unwilling to go down the road of faith and sacrifice at all—the only road that leads to the deep simplicity of wisdom and light. Complexity is valuable, even essential. But those who get stuck there will never know the simple yet profound joy of the Saints. “For ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Our tunnels of ambiguity are there to teach us, not to torment us. And there is light at the end of those tunnels: the Light and Life of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith is not blind. On the contrary, it is by faith that we consciously choose to grow through the complexity that lets us see with our eyes and our hearts wide open. That’s why Alma talked about “the eye of faith.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> That special far-sightedness will let us be among those who, in Moroni’s words, had “faith . . . so exceedingly strong” that they “could not be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad."<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love and admire my husband very much, but introducing him at a BYU Hawaii devotional--or any other gathering requiring a microphone, has never been on my bucket list, so please bear with me as I try to do justice to my subject. &nbsp;I'm going to provide some details about Eric's life and then share a story about him that I think illustrates the kind of light he's going to discuss with you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blessed with intuitively brilliant parents and five outstanding siblings, Eric was raised in the Los Angeles and Seattle areas. During their Los Angeles years, his grandparents and great grandmother shared their house. In addition to the four generations sharing the premises, his parents purchased nanny goats for Eric and his older brother to tend and milk. &nbsp;Those two boys wrote checks to the man who delivered their Purina goat chow, and they sold goat milk to neighbors unable to digest cows milk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a mission in Denmark, Eric completed his undergraduate and law degrees at BYU Provo, which is where we met. &nbsp;Among the greatest blessings and sources of joy in our lives are our three children and eight grandchildren. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After law school, Eric clerked for Judge Clifford Wallace of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and for Justice Lewis Powell of the U. S. Supreme Court, and then practiced law one year in Washington DC and four years in London, England. &nbsp;We then moved to Iowa City where he has taught at the University of Iowa College of Law for 32 years and served as an associate dean for about half of that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two callings have dominated Eric's church service: &nbsp;for as long as I have known him, Eric has been a devoted and faithful home teacher. For almost 19 of the 40 years that we've been married, he has served as a counselor in the stake presidency. &nbsp;Several years ago, a very recent convert whom I had been visiting teaching for a few months, asked me whether I had a husband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 9 years ago, there was a debate at the University of Iowa College of Law on the question of whether same sex marriage should be legal. &nbsp;The participants were two nationally renowned advocates for their positions on this question. Unfortunately, the woman who was going to argue the position opposing same sex marriage missed her connecting flight the morning of the debate and was not able to make it. Eric and another faculty member who is a devout Catholic agreed to step in on very short notice and argue the position in opposition, a very unpopular position in our community, so that the event would not have to be cancelled.</p>
<p>I wasn't there, and although Eric shared with me the trauma of suddenly being thrust into this divisive debate for which he had had so little time to prepare, he didn't mention the part of that story I'm about to share. That came from a University of Iowa colleague--not someone I've met-- who was there. &nbsp;Quoting from him:</p>
<p>"When the debate started, the law faculty moderator was introducing the participants, and said Eric was a man who needed no introduction, and that he was “the person without whom this place would stop.” The entire room erupted in applause and cheers that went on and on, every person in the auditorium acknowledging what he meant to the law school, because he in some way had touched every person’s life, whether they were faculty, staff, or student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the debate, I was with a group of students talking with the attorney who argued the pro-gay marriage side and he said he’d never seen that before, that he’d participated in lots of debates about gay marriage all over the country, and because it’s such a polarizing topic, they were usually tense, often uncomfortable events with lots of screaming and yelling. He had never been at an event where the entire room had so much respect for one of the participants that they would give him such an ovation, regardless of their own beliefs.</p>
<p>But that’s how Eric is, one of, if not the most, fundamentally humane and decent people I’ve ever met...The world could use a few more people like Eric."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know the man who wrote these words, but I know the source of the qualities he describes and hope you will give your attention to my husband as he speaks about that source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Brother Eric G. Andersen]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Invisible Light</em></p>
<p>Since the beginning of recorded history, mankind has been fascinated by light. We have thought about it and written about it, trying to figure out what it is and how it works. We know that it is essential to life on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learned long ago that shining white light through a prism produces an array of colors. But around 1670, Isaac Newton proved that all those colors were actually contained in the white light; they were not (as some believed) somehow added by the prism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we learned something amazing. In 1800 a scientist named William Herschel put light through a prism and was measuring the temperatures of the different colors displayed on a surface. &nbsp;He found that temperatures were higher at the red end of the spectrum than at the violet end. For some reason, he decided to put his thermometer past the range of the red color where there appeared to be no light coming from the prism. He discovered something shocking: &nbsp;the temperature went up – higher, even, than in the color red. He surmised that there was some kind of “invisible light” there, if that makes any sense. We’ve since come to understand that he had discovered infrared rays.</p>
<p>The very next year, scientist Johann Ritter was doing his own experiments with light that had passed through a prism. He was measuring the rate at which the chemical silver chloride reacted in each color of light. He observed that the reaction was less at the red end of the spectrum and greater at the violet end. Then he ran his experiment past the visible, violet light and saw that the chemical reaction was even more pronounced than in the violet color. He had discovered that “invisible light” existed past the other end of the visible-light spectrum. We’ve since learned that he had detected ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>Since the days of Herschel and Ritter, our knowledge of invisible light has expanded enormously. We now know that there is a vast array of waves in what we’ve come to call the electromagnetic spectrum. &nbsp; &nbsp;Visible light is actually a very small portion of that spectrum.</p>
<p>The other portions of the spectrum have been there all the time, but our natural eyes aren’t capable of detecting them. Just think about what became possible as we’ve come to understand and control a vast array of waves in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a broken bone? &nbsp;X-rays were probably used to diagnose it. Do you ever listen to the radio? &nbsp;You’re using radio waves. Have you ever cooked or warmed food in a microwave oven? &nbsp;You know what those waves can do.</p>
<p>But all that power lay dormant until people learned to sense it and to use it. One could almost say that the light shone in the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Divine Light&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that our physical eyes cannot detect are not the only kinds of light that people do not see. There exists a divine, spiritual light that is just as pervasive and, in important ways, more powerful than the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is there, but it must be detected to be of any use to us.</p>
<p>The scriptures are packed with references to “light.” &nbsp;It is everywhere. Indeed, these references are so common, that it can be tempting to ignore them, or to treat them as mere metaphors or figures of speech. But I believe that many of them refer to something that is a fundamental reality in its own right. The scriptures attempt to describe, in our imperfect and limited language, something that is a deep part of our immortal, spiritual existence.</p>
<p>Many of them use the word “light” to describe the influence of the Savior Jesus Christ in our lives. The Gospel of <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">John </span>teaches that Christ is “the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a>&nbsp;</sup>"I am the light, and <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the life, and the truth of the world,” the Lord said to the prophet Ether.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> Through Joseph Smith we learn that “Jesus Christ. . . [is] in all and through all things, the light of truth; Which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;And “the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">From these and many other teachings in the scriptures about light, I have come to believe that this divine light is essential to how we come to perceive, understand and appreciate spiritual things. Our minds are literally “enlightened.” &nbsp;The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that “the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The same passage of scripture goes on to identify this light as much more than a teaching tool; it is the fundamental manifestation of the life-giving power of God:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">“Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space— The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things."<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><em>The Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost</em></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The many references in the scriptures to divine or spiritual light raise a theological point. In our doctrine we recognize the Light of Christ as an influence available to every son and daughter of God born into the world. We also learn that the Holy Ghost is an individual being, a personage of spirit, the third member of the Godhead who witnesses of the Father and the Son, and whose companionship can be claimed as a precious gift by priesthood ordinance following baptism. Exactly how the two work together is a question that I will not pursue. It is enough for me to understand that they work together. As Elder Packer taught:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"It is important . . . to know that the Holy Ghost can work through the Light of Christ. . . . The [Light] of Christ is always there. It never leaves. It cannot leave. . . . Once a person has received that gift of the Holy Ghost and can cultivate it together with the Light of Christ, which they already have, then the fullness of the gospel is open to their understanding."<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In my remarks today, I will consider the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost to be a unified source of divine light in my life, a gift to be sought and cherished. In the time remaining, I would like to share with you some thoughts about that light and experiences with it that have enriched me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><em>Recognizing Truth</em></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Divine light can be the means by which we recognize truth and distinguish between good and evil. Mormon urged to us to accept and profit from that blessing: &nbsp;“Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil.”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This passage of scripture brings to mind an experience I had as a young boy. My family had traveled from our home in California to Salt Lake City, where General Conference was being held. After we had waited in line, an usher found a place for us, up behind the choir on a wooden bench at the base of the big organ pipes in the Tabernacle. It gave me a visual perspective on General Conference that I’ve never had since, and certainly don’t expect to enjoy again. Spencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, began to speak. I have no memory of what he said, but as I viewed him from behind, standing at the pulpit and speaking to the people, in an instant I understood – somehow perceived clearly – that I was seeing and listening to a prophet. It is difficult to describe other than as a moment of enlightenment. It was not a particularly emotional experience, but actually rather matter of fact. I recognized something about him that seemed plain as day to me. He later became the President of Church when I was in my early 20s. Sustaining him in that office was, to me, a completely obvious and easy thing to do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><em>Conversion</em></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Recognizing the truth does us little good if it doesn’t change us in an enduring way. In other words, we must be converted. Divine light has played an essential role in my conversion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The scriptures describe some dramatic conversion experiences, and light is always present in them. Paul saw “a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup> Alma said: &nbsp;“And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold . . .!”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> Light is everywhere in the description of King Lamoni’s conversion:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"[T]he dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness . . . had infused . . . joy into his soul . . .."<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">That enlightenment also occurs when we do not have a dramatic conversion experience, but find our faith growing gradually and organically. Alma described how that works when he compared the development of testimony and conversion to a seed that grows into a tree:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"[It] beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me."<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Trees need light to grow. Divine “enlightenment” provides it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">My own conversion has been much more like the growth of the tree in Alma’s sermon than Alma’s own, thunderous experience with the angel who called him to repentance. I have been blessed with numerous, subtle witnesses of the Spirit, but nothing very dramatic. Changes day to day, or even year to year, have been gradual. But when I look back over time, I see that what began as a seedling is now a mature tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The setting in which I have worked out my professional life has contributed to that slow, steady growth. For the past three decades it has been my privilege to be part of an outstanding faculty of legal scholars, none of whom is a Latter-day Saint. As a group they are more talented and accomplished than I, and I have been challenged by their ideas. I hasten to add that I have consistently been treated with respect by my colleagues, many of whom have become dear friends. But for a person whose formal, higher education was entirely at BYU – a blessing for which I will be eternally grateful – landing in this community has given me an important and valuable opportunity to confront ideas about life’s values and virtues that often contradict my own. That has led me to examine my beliefs and commitments carefully. As Lehi taught, opposition creates the need and opportunity for us to choose.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup></span></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">As I near retirement and take stock of my own conversion in this setting, I can say two things. First, there are many important questions to which I do not have answers. Indeed, the older I get, it sometime seems the less I know. Associating with talented people who disagree with me has made a certain humility come naturally. Second, notwithstanding all I do not know, the pillars of faith in my life feel firm and well set. Just as I saw and recognized Spencer Kimball as a prophet, I see and recognize the fundamental claims of the Restored Gospel as true. For me, there is a clarity and obviousness about it, made possible by the blessing of divine light.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><em>Finding and Retaining the Light</em></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I began this talk by analogizing divine light of the Gospel to the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that, for most of human history, were ignored because they were not seen. Once we look in the right way, we discover that divine light, like those useful microwaves and radio waves and X-rays, is abundant and everywhere. But there are crucial differences. It is possible to disbelieve in divine light in ways that are not possible with X-rays. And even after gaining a knowledge of divine light by personal experience, it is possible to lose it, and even to doubt that it was ever there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finding the Light</span></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Our understanding of natural phenomena is based on the idea of publicly reproducible experiments. If what William Hershel and Johann Ritter discovered was genuine, then other people should get the same results by doing the same experiment under the same conditions. When they do, we have a workable theory, and we can build on it. Crucially, the experimenter’s spiritual perspectives and desires don’t matter. All that matters is that the test is conducted in the physically correct way under physically correct conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The results of that scientific method are truly impressive. That is how we have built the technologically powerful world in which we live.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">But a key mistake, especially in our modern age, is to assume that this is the only way truth can be discovered – that anything that cannot be proved in that way doesn’t really exist outside of our own minds. By limiting the admissible evidence to that which is scientifically provable, some skeptics and atheists conclude that there is no evidence for divine light.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">That kind of skepticism has been around for a long while – well before the age of modern science. Paul describes it in his first letter to the Corinthians:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Why does discerning divine light not submit to the rules of science? &nbsp;The reason, I believe, is that it is given to us for a specific purpose, and accomplishing that purpose requires that we find it in a different way, and use it on different principles than the waves we have discovered in the electromagnetic spectrum. To those who refused to exercise faith (in Paul’s description, the rebellious Jews requiring a sign) or who believed only what their natural minds could perceive (the philosophical Greeks seeking mortal wisdom), the doctrine of the crucified and risen Lord Jesus Christ simply made no sense. They couldn’t “see” it because they didn’t use the spiritual instruments necessary to detect the spiritual light by which these things are known.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Divine light is given us as part of the plan of a Loving Father in Heaven to invite, but not compel, His children to return to Him. In a sense, we are compelled to believe in physical light, microwaves, and radio waves; the physical evidence of them is undeniable. Our Heavenly Father will not, however, compel us to believe in Him, or in the divine light that will help lead us back to Him. Our Father gives us the agency to choose to believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">So spiritual things – which are as real as physical light, microwaves, and radio waves – are manifested in accordance with our faith and our fundamental desires to seek out God and become like Him. If we refuse to exercise faith and do not have that desire, then the spiritual experiment will not work. But when we do, it does work, in a deeply authentic way. Alma describes it thus:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"[T]his is . . . good . . . for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. . . . O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good..."<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">What a beautiful description of the divine light exerting its power within us! It is real, and it is discernible, but by God’s design it is not scientifically provable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retaining the Light</span></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If we have experienced that enlightenment as described by Alma, we need to understand the importance of retaining it. Divine light is simultaneously more energetic and more fragile than the waves on the electromagnetic spectrum. When we have it, it can enlighten, move and motivate us powerfully. But when we lose it, it is possible to doubt that we ever had it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">That, again, I believe, is an intentional quality of divine light which enables us to choose what we want most, and not be forced to accept something. An X-ray can be forced on you; spiritual light will not be, at least not in the long run. There are individuals who have had the light imposed on them, and thereafter remained faithful to it to the end of their mortal days. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Paul and Alma the Younger are two obvious examples. Yet others have found themselves the recipients of unsought spiritual manifestations, and have, for a while, responded positively to them before reverting to their own fundamental desires. That was true of Laman and Lemuel, and also the Nephites who fell away following the miraculous sign of Christ’s birth. To retain spiritual influences, whether they be dramatic or – as is usually the case – more subtle, we have to continually seek them and cherish them.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">One way we can fail to cherish these influences is to be embarrassed by them, and to disown them in light of others’ criticism. That lesson was vividly taught in Lehi’s dream of the tree of life. Recall that, after some of the seekers had endured challenges and hardships to reach the tree, and had partaken of the fruit, they became ashamed when those in the great and spacious building mocked them.<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a>&nbsp;</sup></span>Despising spiritual gifts is a good way to lose them very quickly.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Another way to lose those gifts is to attempt to misuse them for our own purposes – to dominate, to impress, to call favorable attention to ourselves. The proper use of these gifts is to serve others. Individuals can pretend to have them, and sometimes deceive others, but true gospel power cannot be so misused. In my opinion, the passage from D&amp;C 121 on using the powers of the priesthood states a general principle relating to the use of Gospel power: &nbsp;it cannot be controlled or handled except according to the principles of righteousness.<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We can also lose these gifts simply by neglecting them. Even after they have proven their worth, if we</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and [we] pluck it up and cast it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because [our] ground is barren, and [we] will not nourish the tree, therefore [we] cannot have the fruit thereof."<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Spiritual enlightenment is fragile. May we take care not to disown it, misuse it, or neglect it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><em>Becoming a Light to Others</em></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">One of the key elements of the Gospel is that we have the opportunity to contribute to the salvation of others. That includes our becoming a source of light to those around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">“Ye are the light of the world,” Jesus told us.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"</span>A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">What great meaning is contained in that two letter word “so,” as in “let your light SO shine”! &nbsp;It is to shine in a way that glorifies not us but our Father in Heaven. I conclude with two stories illustrating how we can become such a source of light to others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In 1885, a young woman named Margaret Gordon was living with her family in a tiny village in Ontario, Canada. Her father had moved his family to Canada from England and managed to find a job teaching school in that remote place. Margaret, then 19 years old, corresponded with some LDS cousins in Utah. They sent her a copy of the Book of Mormon. As she read it, she felt a powerful spiritual witness that what she was reading was true. She was sufficiently moved that she began sharing her witness with the other members of her family. Eventually her father, the last hold-out, agreed to move the family to Utah, where they joined the Church. Margaret never faltered in her testimony and spent a lifetime of remarkable service on the frontiers of the western U.S. and Canada, building the Kingdom of God.<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Her testimony of the Gospel, and especially of the Book of Mormon, was irrepressible. As an old woman in her 90s, she hauled two, young great grandsons into her little bedroom where she read the Book of Mormon with them aloud, and explained it, and testified of it, verse by verse, over the course of many weeks. It may have seemed a fool’s errand at times, because the little boys squirmed and laughed at the strange names in the book. But the light of her testimony was strong. It shone brightly on the seedling testimonies of the two boys. My brother and I were changed forever by that experience. To each of us, a testimony of the Book of Mormon is an anchor to our faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The final story is one that I felt I could relate only if I was able to verify that it was more than a faith-promoting rumor. My inquiry made it as far as a senior Church officer who heard the young woman tell the story, and who confirmed the details I’ll share with you. That gives me sufficient confidence to tell the story to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">A few years ago, a young woman in Guatemala had been taught by the missionaries, but decided not to continue with the lessons. One day as she was riding a local bus, several young men climbed aboard. She said that she and everyone else on the bus immediately recognized them as gang members by their appearance, including the evidence of handguns under their shirts. This was an all-too-common occurrence in that place. They knew they were about to be robbed. The gang members separated, some going to the front of the bus, some to the back, according to their standard procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The bus came to the next stop and a group of young Mormon elders came aboard. They, too, separated, one standing up front, and the others going back into the bus to sit next to the passengers. The one in front got up and began to teach, sharing with the passengers a message about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The young woman said that he spoke with great power. The bus came to the next stop. The gang members all arose and exited the bus.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">My guess is that those missionaries had no idea what had just happened. Of course I cannot say what went through the minds of the gang members, but it seems quite possible that they were repelled by the spiritual light and power the elders had brought with them, and that they wanted to be away from it. If I am right, a spiritual power and light not only had touched the heart of one who gave heed to it, but had driven darkness away. After the bus ride, the young woman sought out the missionaries, resumed her study of the Gospel, and related this story at her baptism.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I testify that this invisible, spiritual light is as real as infrared or ultraviolet light. How marvelous its effects have been in my life and so many others’ lives! How marvelous that we ourselves can be a source of that light to others! May we cherish it, and nurture it, and share it, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br /></span></p>

<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters,</p>
<p>Good Morning and Nihao.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know me, I am originally from Taichung, Taiwan. When I joined the church in 1982, Taichung was a district that belonged to the Taiwan Taichung Mission. Over the years, this small district has grown into 4 stakes. The early saints in Taiwan, similar to all church pioneers, faced countless challenges. Many were questioned by their families about why they would choose to abandon their traditional beliefs and instead embrace a foreign religion and worship a foreign god.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I was blessed to have understanding parents, others were not as fortunate. During my early days in the church, I remember hearing about one Brother, who was the only member of the Church in his family and faced much opposition when he decided to serve a mission. His parents, siblings, and relatives all strongly criticized his decision as a sign that he was discarding his identity for an alien faith. &nbsp;His parents were so disappointed and heartbroken that they disowned him the night before he reported to the mission office. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a new convert, hearing stories like this Brother’s really made me wonder if the gospel of Jesus Christ really was as foreign and alien to Chinese beliefs as some tend to think. For those unfamiliar with traditional Chinese religions, the most standard answer is that most believe in Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism or a mix of the three as a folk religion. However, what many don’t realize is that while these three main religions originated from around the 5th century BC, the Chinese people have about forty five hundred years of unbroken history and written documents. This has led some scholars to wonder what ancient Chinese people believed in during that space of about two thousand years before Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were introduced. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting approach to this has been through the study of Chinese characters<sup><a href="#FN1" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. As most of you know, Chinese is considered the oldest continuously used writing system in the world. Unlike writing systems based on an alphabet, Chinese is built upon pictures and symbols to illustrate and communicate various meanings. For instance, here are several characters that represent natural elements and abstract concepts from their earliest to their current written format. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one is a circle with a dot in the middle of it which became more boxy, and then is currently written as this, signifying the sun or one day. &nbsp;This second character began as this picture, was simplified over time, and now is written as this. Hopefully, most of you can see how it still represents a mountain. &nbsp;The third one begins as this, eventually becoming more symmetrical and finally standardized as this. &nbsp;This character represents a natural creation with branches and roots. &nbsp;What is it? Yes, it is the word for wood or tree. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the modern styles are more practical, looking at the ancient versions can be insightful and raise thought provoking questions. For example, the character for woman is like these, and modified over time. &nbsp;Looking into the earlier symbols for woman, it is interesting to note that she is carefully depicted as kneeling and with her arms folded in front of her, a position of reverence, worship, or prayer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on, now let’s look at some ideographic words for abstract concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The character used to describe something large is the symbol for a man with his arms extended out as far as possible to form the character for big or great. &nbsp;When a line is added on the top of big or great, it indicates something that is even bigger than the greatest man, namely the sky or heaven. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This character is king. &nbsp;Similar to heaven, what do you think happens when a dot is added on top of the word for king? &nbsp;It’s an indication of someone even bigger or greater than a king. &nbsp;Do you have a word in mind? This character is used for a King of Kings, or a Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just from these basic examples, and given the pictographic and ideographic nature of the Chinese writing system, it makes logical sense that these characters may contain clues about what ancient Chinese people believed in during the 2000 year gap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a gospel perspective, let’s look at the very beginning, with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Could the ancient Chinese people possibly have known this biblical story?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Genesis 2:9, 16, and 17</span>, it describes how there were two trees in the Garden of Eden:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>
<p>&nbsp;17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."<sup><a href="#FN2" target="_blank">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In these scriptures, the Lord God named two particular trees (the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil) and instructed Adam and Eve on what they were forbidden to eat in the garden.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Chinese character for restrict, prohibit, or forbid is, which has two parts; the bottom part symbolizes a decree from someone in authority (specifically deity), and the top part indicates two trees.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Genesis 3:6 </span>it reads:</p>
<p>"And when the woman saw that the tree [of knowledge of good and evil] was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Similar to, the Chinese character to covet, or eagerly wish for something is lán. As you can see, it still has two trees but the character for a woman has replaced the decree from deity.</p>
<p>Lastly,<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> in Genesis 3:7</span>, it reads: "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked."<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The Chinese character for nude or nakedness is, which is made up of the word for clothes on the left and the word for fruit on the right. While the symbol for clothes makes sense, I hope you all are as curious as I am as to why and how the character for fruit was related to nakedness in the minds of the ancient Chinese when they created this character.</p>
<p>In addition to these interesting correlations to Adam and Eve in the Garden, Chinese characters also seem to record significant events very vividly. Consider the next two major stories in the Old Testament- Cain and Abel and the great flood and Noah’s ark. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Genesi<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">s chapter 4,</span> Adam and Eve begat two sons named Cain and Abel. As we all know, Cain was the elder brother who slayed his younger brother Abel, so the Lord set a mark upon Cain.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In Chinese xiōng is the word for elder brother. The word for a murderer, xiōng, has the same person shape and pronunciation as elder brother, but is written so the person has a mark on his face. As the story of Cain and Abel was the first murder in human history, it wouldn’t be surprising if ancient peoples may have taken note. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Noah’s ark and the flood, the Chinese word for a big ship is chuán. &nbsp;On the left of the character is a board or vessel, and on the right are two symbols. The one on the top is the number eight, and the one on the bottom is a mouth or soul, kǒu. &nbsp;Do you remember how many people survived the great flood? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we turn to <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Genesis 7:13</span>, it states that “In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark”.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></span>&nbsp; So there was Noah, his three sons and each of their wives, so in total, eight.</p>
<p>As time goes by, I have also noticed indications of an ancient relationship between God and the Chinese people can been found embedded in traditional cultural practices. &nbsp;For instance, Chinese New Year is just around the corner. &nbsp;On the first day of the New Year, Chinese traditionally greet each other by saying “Congratulations” rather than “Happy New Year”. This is because they have survived the horrible monster of, who comes and devours people on New Year’s Eve. &nbsp;They light fireworks to scare away the monster, and most importantly must place strips of red paper on the top and sides of the entrance to their homes as the color red has the power to repel evil. Here is a photo of people putting red paper around their door. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, on New Year’s Eve, family members gather together inside the house for a traditional dinner and try to keep each other awake until after midnight. Among other dishes, a traditional Chinese New Year dinner generally includes a bitter herb, a sweet brown or white mixture of rice cake, meat from an unblemished animal, and variety of unleavened bread. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sound familiar? The bitter herb, unblemished animal and unleavened bread of the Chinese New Year dinner is the same as the Passover meal. The New Year’s monster harkens back to the destroying angel, while the red on the doorways likewise matches the blood the Israelites put on their doorways from the Passover lamb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described in&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Exodus 12: 7, 8, 23 and 24</span>:</p>
<p>"7 And they shall take of the blood [of a lamb], and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</p>
<p>8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</p>
<p>23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.</p>
<p>24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever."<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p>I believe that the majority of Chinese people today likely do not realize that they have been faithfully observing Passover traditions into the modern day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially given the strong directive in verse 24, while the meaning behind the traditions may have been lost over time, it seems clear that the ancient Chinese people must have taken the Lord’s command from Old Testament times to “observe this thing for an ordinance forever” very seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s approach this from another viewpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is another testimony of Jesus Christ (the God of the Old Testament), and also includes the history of the Jaredites as recorded by the prophet Ether. Interestingly, practices described in the Book of Ether that are unfamiliar or unusual in Western tradition are actually familiar to the Chinese. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, consider the practice of keeping a past king prisoner over the course of his lifetime (instead of killing him) and even allowing him to beget and raise a family in captivity. As described in <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Ether 7:7,</span> “It came to pass that [King] Kib dwelt in captivity, and his people under Korihor his son, until he became exceedingly old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he was yet in captivity.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This practice, while described on several occasions in Jaredite records, was also not unusual in the history of the Chinese monarchy.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In addition, almost all Chinese people know about luminous precious stones like those the Brother of Jared received from the Lord to light the Jaredite boats. &nbsp;These stones are called yè míng zhū. It is common knowledge that these small glowing stones were possessed by the emperors and passed down in the families of each dynasty, as many significant figures (such as the mother of the last Ching emperor) were found buried with yè míng zhū in their tombs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another unique detail in the Book of Mormon that many people wonder about is why the most important person among the Jaredites is without a name and only known as the Brother of Jared. In scripture, we know that the Brother of Jared is highly favored of the Lord as the Lord said of him, “never has man believed in me as thou hast”.<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>While not being addressed by name would be strange or even disrespectful in a Western context, it is the opposite in Chinese tradition. As a symbol of utmost respect, highly esteemed individuals are not called by their given names. For example, children always call their parents, grandparents, and other higher-ranking family members by their relationship to them. It could be for this same reason that Ether chose to describe the mighty Jaredite leader only by his relationship title as the brother of Jared. In a way, we may also be seen as following this tradition in our modern interactions with deity as we address Heavenly Father by his title or relationship to us rather than by name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, given these numerous traces of biblical history in the Chinese writing system and cultural traditions, many scholars wonder how the ancient Chinese people could have so completely forgotten beliefs from before the rise of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that the divine role of Jesus Christ as the Son of the most high God has been replaced by the ancient rulers of China over time. Since the Zhou dynasty, Zhōu cháo, the highest ruler of China also held the title of "tiān zǐ", literally meaning the Son of Heaven or the Son of <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">God.<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, according to research done by renowned scholars Hugh Nibley<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></span> and Vernell Simmons<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup></span>, there is a high likelihood that the ancient Jaredites may have passed through China on their way to the Promised Land and contributed many lasting ideological influences. For example, in order to gain legitimacy as rightful divine rulers, emperors of China usually traveled to Mount Tai, an extremely tall and prestigious mountain, and speak with God.<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup> According to Nibley and Simmons’ propositions, the exceedingly high Mount Shelem where the Brother of Jared communicated with the Lord and received the luminous stones in <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Ether 3:1 </span>appears to coincide with the description and location of Mount Tai.<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Additionally, an ancient book of official ceremonial procedures stated that the emperor-to-be needed to have the status of “Son of God” first. &nbsp;Then, when the imperial Jade Seal was given to him, only then did he become the ruling emperor.<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a>&nbsp;</sup>Interestingly, the phrase “Being Commissioned by Heaven” is also engraved on the Imperial Seal. Since the Chinese use seals instead of signatures, this phrase on the Imperial Seal basically indicated that the Emperor had the authority to represent and act on behalf of Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we likely must wait until after the Second Coming to find out exactly how everything happened, it strengthens my testimony to have these little insights into how Jesus Christ and traditional Chinese beliefs may be even more closely associated than many people realize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am encouraged by these correlations between the Old Testament, the Jaredites and Chinese culture and hope they will be helpful to future missionary efforts, however, I also wish I could travel back in time to many years ago in Taiwan. Knowing what I know now, I wish I could somehow have let the parents of that young Elder know that he was not rejecting his identity and culture by choosing a foreign god, but that it was likely that the ancient Chinese people did know of and worship Heavenly Father and believe in Jesus Christ. Rather than be heartbroken, they should have been proud of their son because he found the true and restored religion of their ancestors, as in <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">3 Nephi 17:4</span>, when Jesus says “now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.”<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter where or into what background we were born, I encourage everyone to seek and find the gospel truths in their cultures and their lives. I testify that we are all children of our Heavenly Father, and that eternal joyfulness can be found if we follow the counsel of our modern day prophets. As Elder Dallin H. Oaks expressed in <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">2012</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup>,</span> while we are encouraged to keep the cultural practices that are in harmony with gospel teachings, we should likewise give up contrary customs and “climb to the higher ground of the gospel culture, to practices and traditions that are rooted in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>To conclude, I would like to express how studying the scriptures with a sincere heart has brought joy to my soul and enlightened my mind to many things. I testify that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, and that the Book of Mormon contains gospel truths which have the power to penetrate through every culture and belief. &nbsp;This is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters Aloha.</p>
<p>I am very humbled to be given this opportunity. I am just as surprised as you are to see me up here. I am usually up in the sound booth with my students and Shawn.</p>
<p>I feel I am no one special. I do not have any accomplishments, for I know I have not achieved anything without Heavenly Father’s help. He has all the accomplishments and at times, has chosen me to help him in His work. For I know, I am only as good as my weakest point and I have many. I also know to man, I am nothing. But, to God, I am the only thing.</p>
<p>I hope, what I present to you this morning will inspire you to look to God and live worthy of His blessings and to set higher goals for this coming year so you can receive all the blessings He has in store for you. Each of you has access to inspiration and revelation. You may leave inspired or bored, it really is your choice. The true teacher here is the Holy Spirit and you have access to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been praying for you and I this day, for Heavenly Father’s Spirit to be with us as I present to you what I feel He would want me to share. I will be asking for your participation during our presentation.</p>
<p>In May 2005, I was called to be the first Bishop for the Young Single Adults 11th Ward in the Laie Hawaii Stake, back then, area 70 Eric B. Shumway and President Ronald A. Rasband, held a special Young Single Adult Fireside for us. At that fireside, Elder Rasband challenged us, as a Bishopric, to warn every Young Single Adult one thing:</p>
<p>That you, Young Single Adults are the devil’s #1 target. This is because of two reasons, first, as Young Single Adults you are totally responsible for 24 hours of your life and are learning how to be more responsible and accountable for your time. The second reason is very simple. You are the next leaders of the Church.</p>
<p>As warned Young Single Adults, being on the front line of temptation, the devil's number 1 target, Elder Rasband challenged all the Young Single Adults to really raise the bar in obeying God?s commandments by setting higher goals, to avoid temptation and not to resist temptation, for if you are resisting temptation, it is too late. For example, if you’re on a diet, don’t walk into a bakery…it’s too late, now you have to decide whether to get something or not. Avoid the bakery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Elder Donald L. Staheli</span> said the following, "Each of us can and should do more to meet the Lord’s expectations of us. During your years as &nbsp;young adults, you’ll make choices and form patterns that will have a major impact on who you will become. Your future happiness, personal righteousness, and relationship with the Lord will depend in large part on the habits you embrace and the choices and commitments you make over the next few years."<a href="#FN1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Elder Richard G. Scott said this, </span>"I encourage you to discover who you really are. I invite you to look beyond the daily routine of life. I urge you to discern through the Spirit your divinely given capacities."<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a>&nbsp;</sup>President Gordon B. Hinckley also said, "Seek for the real things, not the artificial. Seek for the everlasting truths, not the passing whim. Seek for the eternal things of God, not for that which is here today and gone tomorrow. 'Look to God and live!'"<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Proverbs 3:5-6 </span>is says, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths."<a href="#FN4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">President James E. Faust once</span> said, "The Lord has a great work for each of us to do. You may wonder how this can be. You may feel that there is nothing special or superior about you or your ability…The Lord can do remarkable miracles with a person of ordinary ability who is humble, faithful, and diligent in serving the Lord and seeks to improve himself. This is because God is the ultimate source of power."<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Elder Boyd K. Packer </span>said, “No one of us can survive in the world of today, much less in what it soon will become, without personal revelation."<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Personal revelation is the way we receive our testimonies of Jesus Christ, His gospel, and the divine calling of Joseph Smith. Personal revelation is the way we learn divine truths. Personal revelation is the way we receive guidance beyond our own limited understanding in answering life’s questions, meeting challenges, and making decisions. Personal revelation is what we all should be striving for on a daily basis, to help us in this challenging world and to recognize important events that will take place before Christ returns. No one can know the true Jesus Christ and God without receiving personal revelation. We need to receive personal revelation by the Holy Ghost to know that He lives and is our Redeemer of this world. No one can be saved without it.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Bruce R. McConkie </span>said, "It is true that you can reason about doctrinal matters, but you do not get religion into your life until it becomes a matter of personal experience—until you feel something in your soul, until there has been a change made in your heart, until you become a new creature of the Holy Ghost."<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup> He also said, "Revelation is something that should be received by every individual. God is no respecter of persons, and every soul, in the ultimate sense, is just as precious in His sight as the souls of those who are called to positions of leadership."<span style="font-size: 6.94444px;"><a href="#FN8">8</a></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to recognize that, God is more willing to give… than we are to receive. We learn to understand of things of this world and the world to come by receiving personal revelation. In <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">D&amp;C 42:61</span> it reads, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal."<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> When you receive personal revelation you will receive a true clear and simple message.</p>
<p>Note: You don't see things as they are, you see things as you are…In order to see things as they really are you need to be in tune with Heavenly Father, who sees all things.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Jacob 4:13 rea</span>ds, "For the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls. But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also spake them unto prophets of old."<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Every person should be a prophet for himself and in his own concerns and in his own affairs. We prepare to receive personal revelation as the prophets do, by studying the scriptures, fasting, praying, building faith, by doing all you can, and trusting in God. Let me share a personal experience that I feel is important for all Young Single Adults to know. You might think this is too high of a standard to live by but I challenge you to listen to the Spirit and raise the bar.</p>
<p>Please note: I do not have time to explain everything about this, for this topic is for another talk, and can be expressed in more detail. But, I am just showing you the basic simple personal revelation I received, and you too can receive the same. You too can pray about what I am about to tell you so you can receive personal revelation on this matter.</p>
<p>I want to change things up a bit. I hope it will be ok. I want everyone who has a cellphone to turn to D&amp;C 121. You will also be using your light on your cellphone. If you understand what I am saying, turn on your light as you read with me. For I can only explain it to you, I cannot comprehend it for you. I hope the Spirit will teach you as we read D&amp;C 121. Please turn to D&amp;C 121 Verse 34. WHEN I ASK, “DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT?” That is when you can turn on your light if you understand what I am explaining. Turn off all lights. I will be using this section of scripture, as it was revealed to me, as a Dating Template. I hope this will help you raise the bar while you are dating:</p>
<p>As a Bishop years ago, I discovered that most YSA who came to see me, had a lot of dating-related questions. Questions like…"How do I know who is the right person?", "How do I know if he is worthy?", "What is the right way to date?", and many others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question I asked Heavenly Father in prayer was, “How can I help them understand dating better so they can be more responsible daters?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALL LIGHTS OFF</p>
<p>As I prayed, fasted, and pondered on this, I found myself reading D&amp;C 121:34, 35, 36 and I heard a voice in my head that said, “Why do we need to date?”</p>
<p>The only two reasons I could think of were, first, for fun and enjoyment (group dating), and secondly, to find your eternal companion (singular dating), which is what this template is about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Then I read,<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> "34-36 </span>Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson—That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers OF heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">."<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The voice said, “You need to learn this one lesson.” I felt, this is a calling to be extended to someone who is worthy. As a father, I realized that this is an eternal calling that you, priesthood brethren, will be asking someone, someday: “Will you marry me?” It is important for each of us to know that being a father and mother are eternal callings. It is a calling that we will always have, even in the next life, if we are worthy. The voice said, “You have to be worthy to extend this calling.” That means, you need to be worthy to go on a date because you need to know who, when, and how to extend this calling.</p>
<p>Why<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">? &nbsp;Because,</span> "That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness."</p>
<p>All of this came to me all at once and in an orderly manner. Once I learned this one lesson everything started to fall into place. DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT? IS THIS RAISING THE BAR WHILE DATING? ALL LIGHTS OFF.</p>
<p>Then I read the next verse, <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"37 </span>That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man."<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>This is how not to go on a date! The following came to me: “This is what can happen if we are not worthy to go on a date.” Look what happens as your relationship grows in time, when you have been dating for one week, to six months, and even a year or two. LOOK AT THE SIGNS: <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">“...but wh</span>en we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men...”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a person who is not worthy will never announce that he or she is not worthy to go on a date, thus will cover their sins, and as the relationship continues, they will find that someone will be gratifying their pride, either spoiling you in deeds, words, and or in items, or showing off, being boastful, thus gratifying their own pride. This is where the relationship starts turning for the worst. Having a vain ambition, or exercising control or dominion, is noticed when someone gets jealous in a relationship, or even makes you feel that you owe them something for all he or she have done for you. Remember, no one can buy love. We are not items or slave for anyone. When this happens, we become dominating and someone will exercise compulsion upon us. Note what happens if the relationship continues to that point.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">“...in an</span>y degree of unrighteousness, &nbsp;behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man."<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup> If you are planning to get married to someone like this, please ask yourself, are we worthy to go to the Temple? Will our marriage be sealed through the eternities? <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"...Amen </span>to the priesthood or the authority of that man."</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT? &nbsp;ALL LIGHTS OFF.</p>
<p>As I continued reading I found that verse 41 is the correct way to date. It simply says, <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"41</span> No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned."<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup> This is how we should be going on a date having persuasion, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned, being pleasant, and having understanding for each other. I believe that if we do not have any of these qualities, we will need to work at it before dating.</p>
<p>Dating should be planned with the other person in mind. “<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The wa</span>y we communicate in dating and courtship is a key to building a solid marital relationship. Positive communication practiced in dating increases the likelihood of greater commitment, better conflict resolution, and more love between partners in marriage."<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup> When we focus on finding the right person, we should also focus on becoming the right person for someone. I encourage all who date to raise the bar and have a prayer before and after the date with the person you go with. Having the spirit with you will play a major part on finding your future companion.</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT? ALL LIGHTS OFF</p>
<p>&nbsp;As I read the following, the Spirit told me, this is how I will know whom I should extend the eternal calling to: “Will you marry me?“ We will know…<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"42 </span>by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile."<sup><a href="#FN17">17</a></sup> This is the feeling I should receive while dating, nothing will be in the way of your decision, and it should be as plain and clear as possible. There should be no other outside influence and you should know, I mean really know whom you will be marrying. You will know their strengths and weaknesses and will be willing deal with it. by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without any deception.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you do not feel that he or she is the right one for you… the main thing is that both of you have learned not only of each other but of who you really are and you can both move forward knowing what you can improve on, so you can be better for the next person you date. Remember, when we focus on finding the right person, we should also focus on becoming the right person for someone else.</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT? &nbsp;ALL LIGHTS OFF.</p>
<p>Since we are all human, remember that you and your date are not perfect, you my need to correct each other at times while dating. It says this in verse<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> 43, </span>"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved,…"<sup><a href="#FN18">18</a></sup> In other words correct each other with sharpness (right away) then showing an increase of love. A young man and a young woman on a date are responsible to help each other maintain their standards and to protect each other's honor and virtue.</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT? ALL LIGHTS OFF.</p>
<p>If you strive as a couple to honor your priesthood and each other, you will not only be happy, but also know in verse<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, "44</span> “That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.”<sup><a href="#FN19">19</a></sup> This is a blessing of maintaining your worthiness while you are dating. When you extend this eternal calling. Your marriage will be sealed through the eternities. Not just a worldly marriage but an eternal marriage, stronger than the cords of death.</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT? ALL LIGHTS OFF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mahalo for participating. No more lights at this time.</p>
<p>This revelation has been a blessing in my life as I share it with others. To help them understand their responsibility before and during dating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note: These verses of scripture can be used for the learning of other gospel principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receiving personal revelation comes with a price. You are responsible to share it or to keep it to yourself, keep it sacred. You will also be judged for what you know and what has been revealed. For where much is given much is required.</p>
<p>We also need to remember what Robert D. Hales<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;s</span>aid; "Revelation comes on the Lord’s timetable, which often means we must move forward in faith, even though we haven’t received all the answers we desire."<sup><a href="#FN20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many years ago, while preparing an Old Testament Sunday school lesson for our Young Single Adults about Noah and the Ark, much studying, prayer and thought went into this lesson. A small sentence stood out to me, this phrase was, "Church leaders have counseled each of us to build a personal ark."<sup><a href="#FN21">21</a></sup><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span>Let’s look at part of Elder Ladd’s Conference talk that this lesson was based on.</p>
<p>“Build a Personal Ark” I thought about this phrase many times. During the week nothing came to me, but I knew that I like what I heard. I could not stop thinking about the phrase “Build a Personal Ark” and after much study, prayer and pondering of this, it was Sunday and my wife started the lesson and I did not have anything new to share and it was about 20 minutes into the lesson. Then it hit me. “Build a Personal Ark” I stood up and felt inspired to share the following to the class. We all need to build our personal ARK!”</p>
<p>A –is for Attitude. What we choose in this life will depend on our attitude. We all need to learn, to choose right by having a Christ-like attitude. Having a Christ-like attitude is charity, which is the pure love of Christ. In the book of Mormon, we learn that "Charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN22">22</a>&nbsp;</sup></span></p>
<p>These are the very things we should be working on to have a Christ-like attitude. Life is 10% of what happens to you and 90% of how you react to it. We need to remember that obtaining a better attitude will control our thoughts. It will also help us to control our emotions and actions. When we learn to control our attitude, disappointment and change will be easy to handle, having a positive attitude can help us develop a Christ-like love, which will help in our Relationship with God. Having a Christ-like attitude will help strengthen us with the next two principles.</p>
<p>R –is for Relationships. We all need to establish good strong relationships with God our families and those around us. If we are in tune with our Father in Heaven will, we can be inspired to mend and strengthen relationships with family members and others. As members, followers of Christ, we should always look to the Savior as our example to love as He has. Christ said to his followers "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN23">23</a>&nbsp;</sup></span></p>
<p>What relationships are we building? Please think about this… do we have good or bad habits? Are you building a relationship with God or Satan. For in<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Luke 16:13</span>&nbsp;"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN24">24</a></sup></span>&nbsp;By turning the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers. Temple work is another way we strengthen our eternal relationships. In<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Mathew 16:19</span> we read, "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."<sup><a href="#FN25">25</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>K – is for Knowledge. Aristotle All men by nature desire to know. We need to gain knowledge, both temporal and spiritual knowledge. We learn in the<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Doctrine and Covenants</span> "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN26">26</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It also counsels us to learn the gospel and to gain an understanding <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"of th</span>ings both in heaven and in the earth, . . that [we] may be prepared in all things."<sup><a href="#FN27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>As you look to God and live, you will find a whole new way of learning. He has all the knowledge in the world. Being in tune with him will help you prepare for the future. ”Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">”</span><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN28">28</a></sup></span></span></p>
<p>ARK - Knowing that our actions during mortality influence our eternal destiny. Attitude, Relationship, and Knowledge, are the only 3 things we will take with us when we leave this earthly life. That is why it is important for us to build our spiritual ark upon each of these sound principles. Where we go we take our personal ARK with us. I believe, this is the standard that Elder Ladd was talking about. As he said;<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> “We al</span>l need to build a personal ark, to fortify ourselves against this rising tide of evil, to protect ourselves and our families against the floodwaters of iniquity around us. We need to calmly continue to move ahead and to prepare for what will surely come. For if we are prepared our arks will float on a sea of faith if our works have been steadily and surely preparing for the future.”<sup><a href="#FN29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>It is my prayer that we all look to God and live a Christ- like Attitude in making righteous choices, so we can build a strong Relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. I recognize that personal revelation is a gift from God, who is willing to show us many things, there is much to learn and I have a responsibility for the many personal revelations I have received. That is why I am here with you today. I am aware of God and the many blessings He has and wants to share with all who shows their faith by study and prayer. Everything I know is from Him. He has shown me many, mighty things, and I am excited to see and learn of things to come.</p>
<p>The things I shared with you today are not new, but has been revealed to Prophets of old, it is the same Gospel. If you feel it is new, this is Old Good news, and we have to catch up with it. The Holy Sprit can teach you to see what was already there. For “You don't see things as they are, you see things as you are…In order to see things as they really are you need to be in tune with Heavenly Father, who see all things.”</p>
<p>I am not here to boast of myself, but like Ammon said, I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God. Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.”<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN30">30</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Remember… “God is more willing to give… than we are to receive and the best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard, but must be felt. My we feel the Holy Ghost in our lives as we raise the bar, LOOK TO GOD and LIVE worthy to receive personal revelation, so we can Learn and Live on earth Everlasting Truths in building our personal ARK’s.</p>
<p>"For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors."<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><sup><a href="#FN31">31</a></sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6 December 2016<br />John H. Groberg<br />Emeritus General Authority<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters. Aloha!</p>
<p>It is a beautiful morning and your bright smiling faces full of goodness and testimony give me great hope for the future. What a glorious time to be alive! What a wonderful place to be going to school! What a magnificent opportunity you have to be part of the growth and development and ultimate triumph of the Kingdom of God as it moves forward in its prophetic destiny to “fill the earth.” You are among those who will see that prophecy through.</p>
<p>Do you understand what you are part of? You are part of the Kingdom of God! Just think: God lives, Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and the head of His Church — The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — which is the Kingdom of God on earth which will eventually fill the earth — and you are part of it! You have the glorious privilege, as well as the sacred responsibility to help build and strengthen that kingdom. &nbsp;What a privilege! What a blessing! &nbsp;Do you feel it? Do you see your part?</p>
<p>The Savior said: “. . .seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> What does it mean to seek the Kingdom of God? &nbsp;In the Joseph Smith translation of that verse we read: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“ Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>That makes it very clear that our first duty is to build up the Kingdom of God, then all other necessary things will be added unto us.</p>
<p>You can’t fully do your part in building the Kingdom until you see your part clearly &nbsp;and &nbsp;act properly on it. President David O. McKay said that “. . .from this school will go men and women whose influence will be felt for good toward the establishment of peace throughout the world.” That is you — you are to be the men and women who will fulfill that prophecy.</p>
<p>So how do we go about seeing clearly our part in fulfilling prophecy by building and strengthening the Kingdom of God? And where do we get the strength to act properly according to that vision?</p>
<p>To begin with, you listen to and obey the prophets. You listen to General Conference. You are young and relatively inexperienced, but you have testimonies and correct desires. So listen to older more experienced persons who can show you the way. You returned missionaries, aren’t you grateful for good trainers and for good mission presidents? Aren’t we all grateful for good parents and bishops and others who have helped show us the way?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Old Testament there is a great scriptural account of an older person helping a younger person &nbsp;see clearly. Elisha was an older prophet and had a younger helper. &nbsp;Israel was being attacked by the Syrians. At one point Elisha and his helper were in the city of &nbsp;Dotham when it was surrounded by the Syrians. The young man saw that they were surrounded and said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“. . . Alas, my master! How shall we do?” &nbsp;[Elisha] answered, “Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I believe that President McKay and all of the prophets, especially including President Thomas S. Monson and our other great church and school leaders are similarly praying: Lord, open their eyes! &nbsp;Will you open your eyes and see the “chariots of fire” that surround you in our day? Will you do what it takes to fulfill President McKay’s vision?</p>
<p>Sometimes we focus on the evil and darkness in the world — the lying and stealing and defaming and mis-representing which is so rampant today. As we do, it becomes more difficult to see the gloriousness and ultimate triumph of the Kingdom of God. Let us concentrate on the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ! I testify that as you follow the prophets, truth will triumph. President Monson has told us that there never has been a better time to live. There never has been a time when the truths of the Gospel have permeated more people in more parts of the world and in more ways than right now. There never has been a better time to spread the truth. What a great opportunity you have. I promise that as you follow the prophets and keep your testimonies of the Lord Jesus Christ and of His Church strong and active, truth will prevail and evil will fail!</p>
<p>As I prayed about this talk I had the impression: The experiences God has given you are to be shared with others to help them on their journey through life.</p>
<p>Jean and I were once your age. We started college and had the same questions you do: What classes to take, What to major in, Who to date and eventually marry, What about a mission, a job, etc. While your path will be unique to you, the truths we have learned along the way can help you see the most important things.</p>
<p>When I was a student in college the Korean War was still going on and young men were being drafted into the military, so there was a real question of whether I could go on a mission or not. Fortunately the war wound down and I was able to go. As a freshman, I met Jean Sabin from California, on a blind date set up by our sisters. We dated some but when I left on my mission the only agreement we had was that we would write to each other and see how we felt when I returned.</p>
<p>My mission to Tonga was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I loved every thing about it. It was right for me, just as everyone’s mission is, or will be right for him or her. What a joy to know that you are called by a prophet of God to serve where you can best help build His Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How I loved helping people come unto Christ and be baptized — and still do. How I loved feeling that I was helping to build God’s Kingdom — and still do.</p>
<p>I loved receiving letters from Jean, but I was so engrossed in my mission that I didn’t think much about “the next step.”</p>
<p>Towards the end of my mission we got caught in a bad storm at sea, our boat was capsized and we were thrown into the ocean. I struggled to get to shore, but was having difficulty. In the midst of this turmoil I was blessed with the assurance that God knew who I was and where I was and what I needed to do next.</p>
<p>At one desperate point I felt Jean’s hand, heard her voice and felt her presence. Thus I was given strength to make it to shore and also to know what I should do when I got home. Sometimes it is in the midst of incredible turmoil that we are able to see so clearly that other concerns just fade away.</p>
<p>I testify that as we sincerely strive to build and strengthen the Kingdom of God, He will always help us see “the next step.”</p>
<p>When I returned from my mission and reconnected with Jean, we both knew it was right and were married in the Los Angeles Temple. Of course we still had many other decisions to make: schooling, a job, a place to live, starting a family — I’m sure you can relate.</p>
<p>I went on with my schooling, our first daughter was born and eventually we returned to my hometown of Idaho Falls just before our second daughter was born and I began my “career” in Real Estate. A year later I was called to serve as bishop of our ward. What a blessing to have a supportive wife! After serving as bishop for 4 ½ years I was called to be the mission president in Tonga. Our fifth daughter was born a few weeks before we left for Tonga.</p>
<p>The Lord took us step by step and eventually we ended up serving as a General Authority and were assigned to live here in Hawaii for the first two years of my call (during which time our eleventh and last child was born).</p>
<p>In all we tried to do, we had as our primary goal: To do what God wanted us to do to help build His Kingdom in the way He wanted us to. &nbsp;We made mistakes, as we all do, but we continued to try.</p>
<p>As we now enter the last part of our mortal sojourn, we know with deeper conviction than ever, that building the Kingdom of God, largely through our family, is not only our greatest duty, but also our greatest source of joy.</p>
<p>If you have as your #1 goal in life to remain faithful to the Lord and do all you can to help build His Kingdom, which includes properly teaching your children, and keep trying to do so, even when you make mistakes, or when things are hard, He will guide and direct you, as He has us!</p>
<p>So, when you ask the questions:</p>
<p>* What classes should I take?</p>
<p>* What should I do for a living?</p>
<p>* Who should I date and marry?</p>
<p>* Where should I live?</p>
<p>* How should I serve?</p>
<p>Ask these questions in the context of: What will best prepare me to build and strengthen the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>For example: On the all important question of who should I date and eventually marry? Of course you should get the facts, weigh your options, counsel &nbsp;with good people, but above all sincerely ask God: Is this the person I can best work together with to build Thy Kingdom? As you do, you will find that faithfulness to the Lord and His work, in a potential spouse will be the most important factor and take precedence over worldly considerations. If you are sincere, I know from personal experience that the Lord will answer your prayers.</p>
<p>The same principle applies when you ask: What should I do for a living? You need to get the facts, weigh your options and counsel with good people, then ask the Lord: Is this the choice that would best help me build Thy Kingdom? As you sincerely ask in this way, you are tapping into the very basis of your being here, and I promise you the Lord will answer your sincere prayer in a way that will give you a feeling of calm and help you see clearly what you should do.</p>
<p>Each person is unique and has his or her own contribution to make to the building of the Kingdom. Just look at the variety of vocations people have had who helped in building the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Anciently the Lord’s leaders came from fishermen or farmers or herdsmen. In more modern times they have come from carpenters, printers, businessmen, pilots, doctors, teachers, lawyers and more. There is an old saying: “It’s the set of the sail, and not the gale, that determines the way we go.” Any honorable profession can be the preparing ground for service to the Lord, as long as you put your whole heart into it and feel that God is with you. It is not so much the field you pursue as it is the desire of your heart to use it as a means of building His Kingdom that is important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Sometimes these choices are difficult, but I promise you that as you sincerely pray in the context of honestly wanting to help build His Kingdom, He will help you make the right decision. And that promise is to everyone — male and female, young and old, Polynesian, Palangi, or whomever. &nbsp;Remember the promise from Peter.</p>
<p>“ . . . Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons. But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>If you so desire, I know He will help all of you because He wants each one of you to be an integral part of building His Kingdom and establishing Zion in these last days. And just as He has guided Jean and myself, He will guide you.</p>
<p>In the important areas of where to live and how to serve, follow the same pattern and you will receive the same guidance. We should never aspire to any Church calling, but always accept whatever callings we are given with a heart full of gratitude for the privilege of serving and a heart full of determination to serve with all our might, mind and strength. As we pray over these callings and put forth full effort, we will see that they were the best possible way we could help build the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>There are only so many people that will be called to be General Authorities or General Officers in the Church. Also a limited number of people will be called to bishoprics or stake presidencies or Relief Society or Young Women leaders. But there is no limit to the number of people to be called as mothers and fathers and teachers and helpers. And I assure you that any and every call is as important as any other in building the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Isn’t it wonderful that we don’t have to decide where to serve, only how to serve? When we decide to serve a mission, the Lord through his leaders tells us where He wants us to serve, likewise when we decide to serve the Lord with all our heart, He tells us through his leaders what positions He wants us to serve in.</p>
<p>Now, as to where to live. God deems it best for each of us to make that decision. You will make the right decision if you pray to God in the context of sincerely wanting to know where and how you can best build His Kingdom. There was a time when members were asked to come to a central location to help build up Zion. However, we now live in an era where the leaders ask us to build up and strengthen the Kingdom in all parts of the world. Where will that be for you? Only you and God will know for sure, and under His inspiration you can know it for sure!</p>
<p>Let me remind you, in order to build God’s Kingdom in the best way possible we must follow the Prophet. Remember the words of President McKay. He, as all prophets, wanted with all his heart to help build the Kingdom of God. Right here in Laie, he “saw clearly” what needed to be done. He felt a school should be built from which leaders would go to all parts of the world to establish peace, which is another way of saying “build God’s Kingdom” — for it is the Kingdom of ultimate peace!</p>
<p>It took many years and lots of work, but the vision that President McKay saw so clearly is coming to pass and you are part of it. Can you see yourself as part of the fulfillment of that prophecy? Are you doing all you can to fulfill that prophecy? That prophecy will be fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God will grow, with or without you, but what a glorious privilege to be part of its fulfillment!</p>
<p>I promise you that if you truly desire and are willing to obey your leaders and the promptings of the Spirit, you can “see clearly” where you fit in. And oh, how happy you will be as you understand and do your part in fulfilling that vision!</p>
<p>We came to earth at this time to help build His Kingdom. As we sincerely pray, the Lord will bless us with inspiration, even spiritual vision, of what we should do and where and how we should do it. Like all good things, it will take a lot of effort, but with that effort it will come. I promise that you will be able to see clearly and have the strength to act properly in all of these areas.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate the importance of seeing clearly. How many wear glasses? Okay, take your glasses off and give them to someone by you who doesn’t wear glasses, to put on. Now, look at this slide.</p>
<p>Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it clear to you? Now return the glasses. Can you see it better now? Clear vision is vital!</p>
<p>When the prophet Joseph Smith wasn’t sure what to do he decided to pray. When he did he was given a vision and could see clearly what he should do. We are not called to help restore the Gospel as he was, but we are called to help build the Kingdom in our own sphere, and are entitled to see clearly that which we should do.</p>
<p>Your being here at BYU-Hawaii is not a coincidence but is an important part of preparing you to be more effective in building God’s Kingdom. Once you see that truth clearly, other things will fall into place.</p>
<p>Each of us has come to this earth at this specific time with a certain set of skills which when developed and used properly, will help us build the Kingdom of God in the best way possible. To help you recognize your skills, if you haven’t already done so, get your Patriarchal Blessing. Study it carefully, prayerfully and regularly. Then follow the promptings you receive.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already served a mission, do so. If you haven’t already been to the temple, get yourself worthy and ready and go and keep going as often as possible. The temple is one of the best places to see clearly the things of most importance.</p>
<p>When Joseph Smith was persecuted and reviled for telling the truth. He asked:&nbsp;</p>
<p>". . .Why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it. . ."<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p>You may or may not be persecuted or reviled for sticking up to your testimony of the truth, but remember, always stick with it! &nbsp;You can see in vision clearly what the Lord would have you do. And when you do never deny it, but determine to put you whole heart, mind and strength into doing whatever the leaders of the Church ask you to do. Dedicate everything you have or ever will have — all that you are or ever will be — to building and strengthening the Kingdom of God. As you do, I promise you that the Lord will lead you along — step by step — here a little, there a little — until you become what He wants you to become.</p>
<p>It will take a lot of effort, but will bring a lot of joy. I promise that as you pray always and are believing, God will see to it that all things work together for your good and for the building of His Kingdom.</p>
<p>I love you all and assure you that the Lord will help you see clearly what you should do to build His Kingdom. I also promise you that as you faithfully build His Kingdom in the way He desires, He will give you the strength to act properly and fulfill your purpose in life and fill you with unspeakable joy.</p>
<p>I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Savior of the world and the Head of this His Church. I testify that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Kingdom of God on earth. I testify that the Kingdom of God with its light and truth will grow and eventually “fill the earth” as it prevails over the forces of darkness and evil regardless of how daunting they may seem. You will be part of that fulfillment.</p>
<p>I testify that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a true prophet who helped restore the keys of the kingdom of God to earth and that Thomas S. Monson holds those keys today.</p>
<p>I leave my love and blessings with you. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

http://devotional.byuh.edu/media161129<br><title>Thoughts on Thanksgiving and Christmas | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>29 November 2016<br />John S. Tanner<br />President of BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I'm so grateful to Susan for that introduction and am grateful to be with you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aloha!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the only devotional I get to do around Christmas and Thanksgiving. So I decided to talk about Thanksgiving and Christmas with you. I'll be following up on what I've written in the "Ponderings" written by my son that were sent out over Thanksgiving weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to do this less as a talk and more as a teaching because I really miss the classroom. So this is my chance to just teach. I wish we were a smaller group and we could have more participation. I wanted to just do it off some notes so that it could be a little more spontaneous, a little more real, and so that you could feel more of what it's like when I am teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So first I wanted to talk more about the Thanksgiving holiday with you. I love Thanksgiving! It's one of my favorites, if not my favorite holiday. I think I like it so much because it's least compromised by commercialism. At least until you hit Black Friday. Aptly named Black Friday. What an awful way to start off the Christmas season. I like it also because it is strictly American. I had relatives who came over on the Mayflower. It has all these traditions like a Norman Rockwell painting. It has deeply American roots but in addition to that it is also universal. Almost every cultural society has some sort of harvest feast. You can go to many different countries and it is celebrated in lots of different, distinct ways. I also like that it is ancient. Anciently there were feasts of the harvest and Jesus even participated in feasts of the harvest.</p>
<p>We are connected to all those who have held thanksgiving feasts and festivals over the years. But mostly I like it because of the idea of thanksgiving itself. I like the idea of gratitude. I think that gratitude is one of those fundamental virtues that opens up a lot of other virtues for us. It's kind of a prelude to many other good things that we can learn to be more thanksgiving and have gratitude in our hearts. Gratitude for example prepares us for revelation. In the Book of Mormon, just before the famous scripture in Moroni 10, it talks about what you need to do to prepare for that revelation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that we don't often pay enough attention to Moroni 10:3. He says that, <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts."<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></span></span>&nbsp;In other words if you fill your heart with gratitude and thanksgiving then you open your heart to receive revelation. I think that is a true principle there, about revelation and gratitude. So gratitude kind of opens the way for us to know the Lord's will.</p>
<p>Gratitude also opens the heart to feel optimistic and hope. It's an antidote to discouragement and depression. It may sound a little trite but it's true when we sing,<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> "When you are discouraged thinking all is lost...count your many blessings..."<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a>&nbsp;</sup></span>and as we focus on our blessings we get outside of ourselves. We see the world with a different perspective. So gratitude can open our hearts to get out of our depression and self-service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service is often talked about taking us outside of ourselves a little bit. Gratitude also opens our hearts to feel more love. As we focus on how we've been blessed by others our hearts go out to love them. We often have testimony meetings that are more like thank-a-mony meetings because we are thankful for things. But that's the way our hearts overflow with love, often in gratitude.</p>
<p>Finally, I think gratitude is the sign of a good heart. It's the sign of a healthy spiritual life. C.S. Lewis wrote something in a little book that isn't read too much but I quite like it. It's called "Reflections on the Psalms". He said this,<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> "I had not noticed how the humblest, and at the same time most balanced and capacious, minds, praised most, while the cranks, misfits, and malcontents praised least...Praise almost seems to be inner health made audible..."<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></span> I like that. Praise is a sign of spiritual health, and it is the way that our hearts overflow with love and gratitude and praise. God Himself actually sets the pattern for us here. I don't know if you've ever thought about this, but I like the way that Genesis begins.</p>
<p>In some ways the Lord helps us prepare for all the feasts of thanksgiving in the first chapters of Genesis. In that, remember the Lord pronounces the world<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> "good" six times over. "It is good....It is good...It is good...It is good...It is good...It is VERY (emphasis added) good..."<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></span> by the time he gets to the creation of man and woman. That sort of gives us a pattern of the Lord blessing creation. He's inviting us also to participate in the act of seeing in His creations, and in our lives, goodness. It's like a sort of hymn to thanksgiving right in the beginning of Genesis. I think that the He Himself, the Lord Himself, sets the pattern for us to live in a world with thanksgiving that He created for our good and for our blessings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now how can we keep thanksgiving? I know we just passed it, but I don't like to keep it quite so quickly. How can we keep thanksgiving with more focus on its essential purpose of gratitude? I often think there is most with the encroachment of Black Friday, but I still think there are ways.</p>
<p>I want to share a little tradition we have in our family. It began with something my parents did, and my mother invented this for us. What we did in our family when growing up was that mom would have a dish of popcorn or corn (think about the pilgrims). She'd have each of us take a kernel of corn. As we passed it around we shared something that we were thankful for that year. We all knew this was coming so we thought about what we were most thankful for. We had a little thankful service. Some of you do that but I don't know if you do it with corn. Now we've done a new version of this in our family. We use candy corn and rather than have them in the dish, kind of symbolically planting it, we take corn and eat it as we talk about some blessings. From the little children to the adults, all of them are able to participate in this little "corny" activity. Which is actually quite affective, though corny. So my mom had a kind of gift for that sort of thing and we've continued doing that. I suggest you think of doing something like that. It's a way of keeping us focused on that we feast on love, we feast on thanksgiving, we feast on each other's testimonies, before we feast on turkey. It's a really great little tradition.</p>
<p>The scriptur<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">e says that we shouldn't just observe thanksgiving once a year. The scriptures say in the Book of Mormon that we should "live in thanksgiving daily".<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></span> That's an interesting challenge. How do we now extend the thanksgiving holiday and extend this idea of thanksgiving throughout the year? How do we do that daily year round?</p>
<p>I didn't tell Susan this, but I think I'm going to invite her to come participate with me on this. I would like you to share the traditions that two of our daughters have of "Five Greats and Rejoicings".&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Sister Tanner] One of our daughters doesn't let herself get out of bed in the morning until she has thought of five "greats", is what she calls them, which are five things she is grateful for. They have to be very specific to her life currently, meaning that they can't just be five things that are wrote. That really starts her day off right and now she has her children do it. She says they can do it either when they go to bed or when they wake up. She does it in the morning. Our other daughter has little children and every night around the dinner table they all tell one of their rejoicings that day. So what made you rejoice today? What made you grateful? What made you happy? They do it every night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[President Tanner] Thanks! It's really fun to go over to their house and see the rejoicing. It helps my daughter to do the "greats" in the morning because she is like her mother and she wakes up happy. For some of you it make work a little better in the evening. But if you're from a Winder stock, a dairy family, it's always better in the morning. Susan says things are always better in the morning and so it's a great time for them to think of their "greats in their" life, the ways they have been grateful and the great things that have happened to them. They can be little or they can be big. So another way to remember to live in thanksgiving daily is to remember to live IN thanksgiving. The way we live in thanksgiving is not just to be thankful for good things that have happened to us, although that's good.</p>
<p>An even deeper way of living in thanksgiving is to give thanks in everything. <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In Thesselonians, "In everything give thanks..."<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></span> We give thanks in everything. We give thanks even in our circumstances, when we're having trials because we live in thanksgiving and not "if" or "for". There's a similar scripture in<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> 59 and President Uchtdorf gave a wonderful talk about this once.<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup> We have to live in thanksgiving and not just for things because of our lives and we are blessed so much. So it's a way of living in the world. It doesn't just occur on thanksgiving. </span></p>
<p>Now let me turn briefly to what I called in the recent "Ponderings" on our "thanksgiving temple". If you read it you'll remember that the Temple, our beautiful Temple in Laie, was dedicated on thanksgiving day in 1919. We talked about that in the "Ponderings" that it can make us be thankful for it and it can make us be knit together as sheaves. I wanted to talk about a little incident, this happened in 1915 when the sight was dedicated. This is also just a wonderful little story about our temple and how we got this wonderful temple here. It's really quite remarkable. This temple which was the fifth operating temple built in the Church was dedicated first as the one after the Salt Lake temple. It was very much a pioneer temple in a way. The first one outside of the continental United States, but how did it come about? Well the story is really a remarkable one. President Joseph F. Smith, Iosepa, who loved this Hawaii and loved this place was here with one of the Apostles, Reed Smoot, and the Presiding Bishop, Charles Nibley.</p>
<p>One night they were in the mission home, which was on the other side of where the current Temple President's home sits. He says come on a walk with me and they walked to a chapel which was near where the Temple is now. The I Hemolele Chapel. Now I want to tell you in the way that it was told in Reed Smoot's language. "President Smith came to me and said, 'Reed,I want you to take a walk with me.' As we went out the door, he said to Bishop Nibley, 'I wish you would accompany us.' I never saw a more perfect night in all my life..."</p>
<p>It was one of those I love Laie nights and I always think of this whenever I experience one of those nights, especially near the Temple. And he says, "...the surroundings were perfect. You who have been in Laie know the surroundings; and nature smiles. We walked toward the meeting house. Nothing was said of what we were going for until we stood at the back of the meetinghouse. President Smith then said, 'Brethren, this is the birthday of President Brigham Young, June 1, 1915. I feel impressed to dedicate this ground for the erection of a Temple of God, for a place where the peoples of the Pacific Isles can come and do their temple work. I have not presented this to the Council of the Twelve or to my counselors...'" imagine that! He hadn't even told the First Presidency or the Twelve that he was going to do this. He just felt the Spirit flowing up from the ground and the beautiful atmosphere. He says, "'...I feel impressed to...but if you think there would be no objection to it, I think now is the time to dedicate the ground.'" Then Reed Smooth continues, "I have heard President Smith pray hundreds of times. He has thrilled my soul many times with his wonderful spirit of prayer and his supplication to our Heavenly Father. But never in all my life did I hear such a prayer. The very ground seemed to be sacred, and he seemed as if he were talking face to face with the Father. I cannot and never will forget it if I live a thousand years."</p>
<p>I share that so that sometimes you may think of that as you walk those temple grounds. I also wanted to share the dedication because I wanted to talk in thanksgiving before I turn to Christmas. About what it means to have the Temple in our midst. That act of dedicating the ground for the temple changed Laie forever. It is really the reason that we are here. I'm convinced that David O. McKay established the university here to be in the shadow of the temple. It's the reason that so many people came here and that this continued to be a Zion place, a place of refuge and of gathering.</p>
<p>In fact, what happened after the Temple was announced was there was a community of Latter-day Saintes living in a little village called Iosepa in Skull Valley. Hawaiians were in this desolate place and when they heard of the Temple and the encouragement of their Iospepa, Joseph F. Smith, they came back in a wonderful mass migration from Zion back to Zion.</p>
<p>Many others have come here for the same reason; to receive their Endowments. In fact, when Joseph F. Smith went back and announced this in conference he said that this place, as he said to the brethren, would be a place not only for Hawaiians but for the peoples of the Pacific until they could have their own temples in their own places. He specifically mentioned New Zealand and Tonga and Samoa and French Polynesia, but the whole Pacific.</p>
<p>So that's the other consequence of having a Temple here is that Laie became international. We as an international university with our flag circle. PCC is an international gathering place. That's really an extension. We are extensions of the Temple. It became a sight that people came to from many different countries. That's another blessing of having the Temple here. Of course, another blessing of having the Temple here is that it's given people a way to have their Endowments.</p>
<p>Again, I'm convinced that you, young people especially, will become the leaders you need to become. Not just from the lessons you learn here but lessons you will learn in the Temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Temple often. It will become like a sacred place for you. It is like the waters of Mormon. You can kind of paraphrase that scripture in the Book of Mormon about the waters of Mormon. Just substitute the word Laie in it. And it Says,<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> "All these things were done in the waters of Mormon...by the waters of Mormon," and so forth. "Now it came to pass that all of this," All these ordinances, all these blessings, "were done in Laie, yea by the bay of Laie, by the palm trees that was near the beaches of Laie, yea in the place of Laie, yea in the beaches of Laie, yea in the palm trees of Laie, how beautiful are they in the eyes of them that came to a knowledge of their Redeemer and how blessed are they and they will sing His praises forever more."<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p>And many people who've come here to Laie and received their Endowments sing the praises of this place because of the Temple. You can have that same experience and try to seek it out.</p>
<p>Finally, the Temple sets a standard of beauty for us. We need to take that seriously here in our university. I've challenged our facilities people, I've challenged us as students and faculty and staff. We need to keep this place clean and beautiful so that it's fit company for our Temple.</p>
<p>When David O McKay dedicated the university he encouraged the people here to make this "village', he called it, beautiful. To make this campus beautiful, to have an aura of light shine from it I encourage you and I to do the same thing. When you see something that needs cleaning up clean it up as you walk by. Keep this place comely and beautiful. We are going to continue to focus on that so that it can be worthy to be in the shadow of the Temple. So my invitation for you for this first part of my talk is that you go to the Temple often. Prepare yourselves to be leaders not only by what you learn here but by what you feel and learn there. Keep your lives and your campus just as beautiful as the temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I want to turn to the Christmas thoughts. We all love Christmas don't we? I love it. In fact, it's many people's favorite holiday. The challenge with Christmas is that we almost love it too much. It's so popular that we've decorated it. We've adorned it and we've embellished it with popular accretions. They're not bad, but sometimes they distract us from the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>You know we have Santa Clause which isn't bad but sometimes can be distracting. We have all that shopping that can take us away from the holy day and make us thing of the holiday. We have traditions that are pagan in origin, like Christmas trees, which are fine.</p>
<p>However, some even misinform us of what happened in the scriptures. For example, Christmas Crèches. I love Christmas Crèches. In fact Nativity scenes are one of the few things Susan and I will (we aren't shoppers) but when we travel we often try to get one because they often express the love of the people. They are set with African settings or South American settings. We have a wonderful little Brazilian one where the people look like they are from Brazil.</p>
<p>I love that but almost every Crèche you'll see Mary on a donkey, three wise men at the Manger, and a star at the manger. Actually none of those are in the scriptures. There's no mention of Mary on a donkey in the scriptures. She might have had a donkey she might not have come on a donkey. There were three gifts the Wisemen brought but it never mentioned that there were three that came. Much less their names. Much less if there was a fourth one as the story goes. We just invent a lot of things about Christmas. The Magi is a story told in Matthew and it says that they found Christ not in a manger but at a house and that they were led there by a star and the star isn't mentioned at the manger. So it just kind of conflates things and it's not bad.</p>
<p>However, I'd like to spend just the last part of this talk just taking us to the scriptures for a minute. I wish you were in my home or my class and we could have some conversations. So, let's just turn to the scriptures and see what they say. Luke 2 and 4 talk about the journey. I want you to read the scriptures now with your imagination, with your focusing on the words, focusing on what they say and what they might imply. That journey, <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"And Joseph also went"</span>.<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> Well what do we know about the journey? How far is it from Nazareth to Bethlehem? You can read that in a split second. What does it mean to walk it? Well I've driven it. We were filming about Christ, "The Messiah", it was called and we drove from Nazareth to Bethlehem and it's a long way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's about a hundred miles maybe ninety-eight miles it depends on the road. It's a long ways and how did they get there? No mention of a donkey they might have ridden they might have walked. How did they do it? What was the terrain like? Well if you read the scriptures you often read about the hill country of Judea and the way that you go from Nazareth to Judea. There were two basic roads. You would either go down to the River Jordan, it was a smoother route, and then up from Jericho to Jerusalem, or you'd go from Samaria, which is quite hilly but a little more direct. Either way there are a lot of hills. If you went the Jericho route from Jordan that's one of the lowest places on the earth. You go up from about 900 feet below sea level to about 2500 feet above sea level. You are talking about a long hike at the end of the journey.</p>
<p>Now when Susan was pregnant with our first child she had endema, which is a swelling of the ankles. How was Mary doing on that journey? What was the terrain like? What was that journey like? I think we need to think about that, not just the decorations, but what are the scriptures inviting us to think of. How far along was Mary? We don't know. It says she was pregnant, and I love that in<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> King James it states she was "great with child."<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup></span>&nbsp;She may have been far along on that journey. It just says the days were short from when she was going to be delivered. How many days? How was the journey? How did Mary and Joseph take that journey? <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Then, vs 7, which is rich with meaning for us, "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;Let's slow down and tal</span>k about this. She brought forth. How long was the labor? What was it like? What did Mary and Joseph know about child birth, especially Joseph? Had he ever seen a birth? Not likely. Had she? Were they alone or was anybody with them? Was Elizabeth there, a cousin? Was a woman there that could help Mary? Again we don't know, but the picture we get is of just these two and it says she brought forth.</p>
<p>I know as a husband that there is only so much you can do what the best of intentions. In the end it's about the woman. It's about the woman who has to face that birth. She brought forth her first born son. Was there any water to clean the baby? To clean the mother? It said that she had linen there, <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"swaddling clothes"</span>. It suggests to me that Mary might have prepared in advance. Maybe she knew this was coming and she wanted to have some linen there. Maybe but we don't know that. There is much more about those swaddling clothes and the traditions of the day. <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"And she laid him in a manger".<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup></span></p>
<p>As a boy I thought the manger was a pretty cool place to be born. I had all the visions of the crèches. It looked kind of beautiful, kind of lovely. What was the manger? Well it comes from the French, from the word "manger" which is "to eat". It's probably a feed box or a trough. It could be a whole stable. But in any case it probably isn't that clean. Maybe Joseph had to sweep away the dung. A manger. The sign that the Shepherds were given was that the baby would be lying in swaddling clothes lying in a manger. Swaddling clothes were pretty common and most babies would be given, but a manger...a manger was unusual.</p>
<p>The manger is contrasted to the verse with the inn. The manger verses the inn. There was no room for them at the inn. Now what is the inn? It was probably kind of like a hostile. It wasn't a Hotel Marriott but it was better than a manger, than a stable. It was where travelers stayed. Now because there was no room for them at the inn, I like to emphasize it this way: that there was no room for THEM in the inn. There might have been room if it had been someone else. At least maybe in their day in our day money talks. Do you think they might have been poor?</p>
<p>There is some indication in scripture that they were. In Leviticus it says that if you don't have enough to sacrifice a lamb for the first born son you can<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> sacrifice two turtle doves.<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup> </span>Joseph and Mary sacrificed two turtle doves. They were probably poor. Maybe there was no room for THEM in the inn. Now the<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Joseph Smith Translation makes this even clearer. If you can compare the two the JST "because there was none to give room for them in the inns".<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup></span> The emphasis isn't on the absence of room in the inn, it is on the absence of the room in the hearts of those in the inn. There was none who would give them room and it doesn't just say "inn" here it says "inns". The suggestion is that they were repeatedly denied room in inns. That perhaps someone with a more generous heart would have made room from them. Might have made room for the Savior of the world, who would soon make room on the cross for us in mansions above.</p>
<p>Now I would like to turn to the Shepherds. I think I'll do this very quickly. I love the story of the shepherds. It's story for me of humble people who are good people. I<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">n Alma it </span>says that they were just and holy men who heard the angel.<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup> They were common sorts. They weren't kings but they were transformed by what they had heard that night. They came hasting and they leave as the first missionaries proclaiming the first tidings of what they had seen. Jesus makes everything better. He makes common men uncommon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love something that a colleague of mine once wrote about the transformative power of the Savior in a Christmas essay. "When Jesus entered the world all things were transformed. Not because they looked different but because He was in their midst. He knew the real worth. As an artist takes common colors and blends them into beauty, Christ took common things, like these shepherds, and raised them into sanctity. He led men to see as they had never seen before. The hidden holiness in the world. The leaven and salt, wind and sea, publicans and sinners, all revealed before his eyes the inner goodness."&nbsp;</p>
<p>So He revealed and brought about in these shepherds a transformation. They became ambassadors. They became courtiers who knelt at the feet of Christ. They became his emissaries. This babe, this little baby who once was Jehovah, who's hands spun the stars, now had a hand small enough just to place in His mother's hand.</p>
<p>He condescended to become our Savior. He took upon Himself flesh. He allowed himself to be transformed into a mere human who could become a baby. Now He's the Lord of the Earth and he demands of us more. He asks us to become something too. To become the light of the world.</p>
<p>On December 1st we are going to light the lights of the university and begin inaugurating the season. The Church is also celebrating us becoming the light of the world. That's what this season means. The Lord doesn't need admirers. He doesn't just need people to sing carols to Him. That's great, but He needs us to serve others. He needs us to represent Him. To represent Him in the world and become His disciples. Now in conclusion, I'd like to do two things. I'd like to share with you something that I shared last year but I'd like to have it sung. I'd like to share a carol with you that I wrote when I was thinking these thoughts a few years ago and it's called "One Night in a Stable." It focusses on Joseph and Mary in the first verse and in the second verse on the shepherds. The words read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"One night in a stable, the fair Virgin Mary</p>
<p>Gave birth to a baby while far from her home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With no but Joseph to comfort or carry</p>
<p>The wonderful knowledge that this was God's son.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While warm in the inns wealthy lodger lay dreaming,</p>
<p>A savior was born who would love them so well,</p>
<p>The he made them room, while his mother was weeping (This is at the cross),</p>
<p>In mansions so splended as no tongue can tell."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the Shepherds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That night on a hillside poor shepherds heard singing</p>
<p>And, summoned, came hasting to honor the Lamb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With wonder they worshipped, from poverty bringing</p>
<p>Such rare gifts as pure hearts, bent knees, and clean hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No kings from the East could have brought to the stable</p>
<p>More dignified gifts-not gold, incense, or spice.</p>
<p>And there at the manger, by God's grace enabled,</p>
<p>Poor people like us were made courtiers of Christ."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then after the song and the prayer I would like to share fudge with you. I was inspired by Susan's example and the past couple of weeks I've made batches and batches of fudge. So there should be one for each of you as you leave the building. Susan's bread was a reminder to share the bread of life. The Savior said we should be the light of the world and He said you should be the salt of the world. I guess we are the sugar of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you be sweeter because of this? Treat each other with more Aloha, with more love, with more compassion and consideration because of this sweetness. I bear my testimony to you my brothers and sisters that we love you. I love the Lord. I want to be like Him. I'm far from that. This is a season of the year in Thanksgiving and Christmas where we can all strive a little better to be like the Lord. To bring light to the world and to bring goodness and sweetness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear testimony of Jesus Christ, that He lives. I bear testimony that God lives. I do this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha.</p>
<p>It is good to be with you today. I am grateful to my parents for their examples of love and faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early in the Savior’s ministry, after a long day of teaching parables, He and His disciples took a boat to pass over to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. In the Book of Mark, Chapter 4, we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. [Meaning, they were in danger of sinking]</p>
<p>&nbsp;38 And [Jesus] was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p>
<p>&nbsp;39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Do you ever feel like this; like you are about to sink and calling on the Lord to save you? Today I have felt impressed to share with you a testimony of our Savior’s power to heal us: everyday, but especially in those inevitable times when the storms of life rage and the wind and waves beat upon us.</p>
<p>To you students, I watch you with amazement. You are an inspiration to me. What you are doing at this time of your lives is incredible. You’re in classes, you work, you’re managing a social life, you have callings, some of you have new families, you’re stretching your minds, and strengthening your testimonies. What you are doing now is also incredibly important. You are making critical, life-altering decisions. And, if you’re anything like I was in college, you’re making mistakes, you’re having huge triumphs and also epic failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of that, I imagine you have times where you feel overwhelmed. Even those of us who are not students are also constantly having new experiences with varying degrees of joy and difficulty. If any of you feel you have something of a storm raging in your life or the life of someone you love, I invite you to hold onto that in your mind. I promise you that the Lord will give you insight today, through His Spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve felt impressed to share a few things that have helped me. I have worried a little that it might seem like a prescription or a formula and it’s not. I simply share these thoughts in humility and with reverence for your life experience, in the hopes that they might be helpful and might invite the Spirit to teach each of us today in our own personal circumstance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the October 2010 General Conference, President Uchtdorf gave a talk entitled, “Of Things That Matter Most.” He said, “When stress levels rise, when distress appears, when tragedy strikes, too often we attempt to keep up the same frantic pace or even accelerate, thinking somehow that the more rushed our pace, the better off we will be…It is good advice to slow down a little, steady the course, and focus on the essentials when experiencing adverse conditions.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>So, how do we do that? How, in the midst of our storms, do we steady the course? Here are a few essentials that I have found to help me better hear the Savior’s words, “Peace, be still.”&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#1: Set apart time for stillness in your life</p>
<p>In the Book of Matthew, Chapter fourteen, Jesus had just received word that his cousin and dear friend, John the Baptist, had been beheaded. Immediately, He “departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.” Of course, because he was Jesus, the multitudes followed him out of the city and he was “moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick.” He then miraculously fed many more than 5,000 people from five loaves of bread and two fishes and then instructed his disciples to go out on the ship while he sent the multitudes away.</p>
<p>In verses 22-23 it reads, “And when [Jesus] had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>When I read this earlier this year, I was struck by how much the Savior probably needed to be alone that day, having just lost one of his oldest, dearest and most faithful friends. The scriptures often describe Him as finding “a solitary place” or “a place apart.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> This was His habit. In fact, when the time came for the great atonement, the Book of Luke records that Christ went to the Garden of Gethsemane, because he was “wont” or accustomed to go there.<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> The Savior sets the example of taking time to be alone and apart, to commune with His Father. He shows us that it’s important to seek stillness regularly, but especially in times of stress or where much is required of us. I’m not trying to say that the Savior was stressed, because I don’t know whether He was. But, I am saying that He prioritized taking time to commune, reflect, and renew.</p>
<p>So, I ask you, where is your place apart? Do you take time to nourish your soul? Let’s each follow the example of our Savior and find a place or activity to be “apart.”</p>
<p>Create spaces where you can see beyond your classes or callings or responsibilities and where you can hear the Spirit, because it is, after all, a STILL small voice. If you invest that time, you will find that you are stronger and better able to accomplish what is ahead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#2 Get to know your Heavenly Father and your Savior</p>
<p>Take the time to know who the Father and Jesus Christ really are and who They are to YOU.</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf said: “Our relationship with God is most sacred and vital. We are His spirit children. He is our Father. He desires our happiness. As we seek Him, as we learn of His Son, Jesus Christ, as we open our hearts to the influence of the Holy Spirit, our lives become more stable and secure.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To strengthen our relationship with God, we need some meaningful time alone with Him. Quietly focusing on daily personal prayer and scripture study, always aiming to be worthy of a current temple recommend—these will be some wise investments of our time and efforts to draw closer to our Heavenly Father. Let us heed the invitation in Psalms: ‘Be still, and know that I am God.’”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There it is again, Be, still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Holland shares his apostolic testimony of the relationship we have with our Father and Christ. I invite you to reflect on what this means to you personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[VIDEO]<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Elder Holland assures us that the Father and Jesus Christ know us personally and “no one can fall lower than the light of Christ shines…That isn’t possible.”</p>
<p>I’d like to pick up the story where we left off, with Christ being on the mountain apart. It was somewhere between three and six o’clock in the morning when He joined his disciples, walking on the water. The ship was now in the middle of the sea in a storm, being tossed in the wind and waves and, when they saw Him walking on the sea. Let’s just think about this: This was relatively early in the Savior’s ministry and they had seen Him heal, forgive sins, and even raise the dead. They’d had a long day and, by the looks of it, a long night. So, they were understandably afraid when they saw something on the water. His voice cut through the confusion as He quickly told them to, “Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.”<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</p>
<p>And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
<p>And immediately Jesus stretched for his hand, and caught him.</p>
<p>And when they were come in to the ship, the wind ceased.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter had faith to get out of the boat and put his feet on the water. This is not a small thing. Besides the waves and wind, it was probably still dark, and he was a fisherman by trade so he would have known the risks and dangers. But, he trusted the Lord, took the steps and walked on the water. And, even though he got scared by the storm and began to sink, he cried out to the Lord to save him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we sometimes like Peter? We can’t see the Savior in the dark of a storm and so maybe we forget what we already know; that He’s already there? Peter jumped in, walked, fell, cried out and the Savior caught him. That sounds about right. If the Father and Savior are with us all the way, they will be with us through all of those steps. And, at least in my life, the Savior is patient with that. The Savior told Peter, “Oh thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” but I take that to be the Savior saying: I’m right here. You can trust me to stay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this picture. While it reminds me of this experience with Peter, it really more makes me think of all of us. How often do I feel “under the water” because I got scared, overwhelmed, hurt, tired or whatever? The Savior is reaching out His hand and saying, “Come.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, Elder Ballard talked about Christ at this last Conference in a way that really stuck with me. He called Him, “a Savior who is your best friend.” I loved that! Someone who knows all about me and still loves me. Of course I know that, technically, but to have it said so plainly made me pay extra attention to how I approach my relationship with Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we can learn about who the Father and the Christ are, but who are they to us? If They are our friends, what is your current “friendship status” with the Them? Is the newsfeed of your mind and heart filled with posts about the things you do together?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#3: Hold on</p>
<p>Well, those last two stories were about the Savior calming the storm. What about those storms where no answer comes or it isn’t healed or fixed it right away or even maybe at all? Is the Savior in those storms, too? You bet. Sometimes we wait for longer than we want to wait, or longer than we feel, in our mortal perspective, is necessary or even merciful to wait. If you think about the stories in the scriptures, it’s actually pretty common to be required to be still or to hold on for a while. I bet you can think of a time or two when you’ve waited and waited upon the Lord for an answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith is a hero in my life. The things that man had to suffer and the joyful way he lived amaze me. In Liberty Jail, where he and his companions had been imprisoned for months, he received reports of unspeakable things that were happening to the Saints, his friends. In Sections 121 and 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we get a glimpse into a prophet working through a difficult storm with his Savior. Do you hear yourself in Joseph’s honest plea in Section 121? “O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yeah thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people?”<sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, with a heart full of understanding, the Lord answered back, in verse seven, “My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment.”<sup><a href="#FN10">10</a></sup> Peace, he says, be still. In Section 122, the Lord continues by listing many, many more hard things that Joseph had yet to go through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, referring to Joseph with words that evoke the image of a ship on a stormy sea, He said, “If thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; know thou, my son, that all these things shall give the experience and shall be for thy good.” Then, in verse nine, he closed by saying, “hold on.” “Hold on thy way. Thy days are known and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.”<sup><a href="#FN11">11</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like with Joseph, the Lord says to us, “I see you from the beginning to the end. You have a work to do. And, this, this storm, is but a small moment. So just hold on. I’ve got you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Holland’s words in his October 2013 Conference talk, Like a Broken Vessel, are so comforting. He said, “So how do you best respond when mental or emotional challenges confront you or those you love? Above all, never lose faith in your Father in Heaven, who loves you more than you can comprehend…As President Monson said: ‘That love never changes…It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God’s love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve [it]. It is simply always there.’</p>
<p>Never, ever doubt that, and never harden your heart. Faithfully pursue the time-tested devotional practices that bring the Spirit of the Lord into your life. Believe in miracles. I have seen so many of them come when every other indication would say that hope was lost. Hope is never lost. If those miracles do not come soon or fully or seemingly at all, remember the Savior’s own anguished example: if the bitter cup does not pass, drink it and be strong, trusting in happier days ahead.</p>
<p>“Don’t assume you can fix everything, but fix what you can. If those are only small victories, be grateful for them and be patient. Dozens of times in the scriptures, the Lord commands someone to “stand still” or “be still”—and wait.6 &nbsp;Patiently enduring some things is part of our mortal education.”<sup><a href="#FN12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard sometimes to endure or see the reasons why the things that we want have to wait. But, that’s life. Joseph never got to set foot in the physical Zion in the West that he saw so clearly in his visions. In the end, sometimes we wait and the Lord whispers through the storm, “Peace, be still.” Trust that the God who calms the storms of the sea, will also calm the storms in our hearts. We must hold on for the Lord’s timing, recognizing that, although our situation may not change, He loves us and knows the end from the beginning of our story.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#4 SIMPLIFY</p>
<p>In the words of Elder Uchtdorf, Let’s be honest; it’s rather easy to be busy. We all can think up a list of tasks that will overwhelm our schedules. Some might even think that their self-worth depends on the length of their to-do list. They flood the open spaces in their time with lists of meetings and minutia—even during times of stress and fatigue. Because they unnecessarily complicate their lives, they often feel increased frustration, diminished joy, and too little sense of meaning in their lives.”<sup><a href="#FN13">13</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is a lesson that the Lord is constantly teaching me, I learned it most profoundly during what was probably the biggest storm of my life. After a beautiful and relatively easy pregnancy, complications from the delivery brought me to the edge of life. I lay in the hospital for a month, only partially aware of what was going on and closer to death than I actually then realized. I literally could do nothing on my own. I remember the day that I first felt lucid enough to get perspective on it all and I wrote myself a list so I wouldn’t forget the moment of pure inspiration. Do you think my list had groceries on it or work deadlines? Nope. It said, “Everyone has been amazing. Love them and remember that. Remember that you thought you were going to die. Life is good…live it, be grateful for it. Listen. Simplicity. Slow down, relax, be less worried. Be authentic. Miracles have happened.” But some of my favorites that relate specifically to what we are talking about today are: “Guess what, the world didn’t stop without you!” (Meaning, I realized that I didn’t have to do everything I had thought was so essential before). Another was, “sometimes you just have to say, ‘oh well’”! (Which was very uncharacteristic of me at the time). And finally, “The Lord and Heavenly Father know…follow them.” In the center of it all, in the eye of that storm, the Lord healed me, and not just physically. He taught me the things that mattered most. My family who made extraordinary sacrifices, my health, my job, the priesthood, angels and prayers. I saw that I had been “careful and troubled about many things” but not all of them were needful.<sup><a href="#FN14">14</a></sup> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Oaks taught, “Most of us have more things expected of us than we can possibly do. We should begin by recognizing the reality that just because something is good is not a sufficient reason for doing it. We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families.”<sup><a href="#FN15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to take the time to listen. We have to make the space to hear His voice. Do you have expectations of yourself that are not the same as the Lord’s expectations for you? Consider the circumstances of your life right now, set priorities and then go to the Lord for guidance and confirmation. It is important for us to get really clear about what the Lord’s expectation is for us, personally. You know, I find that when I’m worked up and worried about all that I have to do, more often than not, it’s the Lord who says, “Peace, be still. Seek the Lord’s will and see what you both can do to calm the storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An easy and powerful way to find simplicity is with gratitude. Usually, I start with the smallest, most basic things: that I’m breathing in and out, that I have running water, the gospel is in my life, my daughter is safe, my family loves me, I have food to eat. These lead on and on until I am filled with a greater understanding of how blessed I am and how the arms of my Heavenly Father and Savior are wrapped around me every day. I become less stressed as I see the simple that I take for granted that are already taken care of. So, in this time of Thanksgiving, I recommend that we make an extra effort to increase our gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started by talking about how complex your lives are and how incredibly important this time is, and especially for you as students. In the words of President Uchtdorf, “amidst the multitude of voices and choices, the humble Man of Galilee stands with hands outstretched, waiting. His is a simple message: “Come, follow me.” And He does not speak with a powerful megaphone but with a still, small voice.”<sup><a href="#FN16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>I have a testimony that as we reach out to our Savior, He will calm us, whether we stay in the center of the storm or He leads us out. As I’ve prepared this talk, I’ve had this picture in my mind of the Savior hushing me, the way you would soothe a child. He will take our hands and comfort us. He will make up the difference. The peace and calm are in Him, whether it is in the center of our storm or He is leading us out. As we turn toward Him and not away, and center our lives on Him and the Father, we will feel them anchor us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>15 November 2016<br />Richard L. Bushman<br />BYU Center of Religious Studies <br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I was delighted to receive an invitation from President Tanner to address you today. Having been here before, I know that you are an unusual collection of Latter-day Saints, studying in an unusual location, and receiving an unusual education. My wife Claudia and I recently spent a week speaking in Korea and came away with a new view of how the Church works around the globe. I welcome the opportunity to get to know you a little better.</p>
<p>Should the opportunity ever come to you to travel to Salt Lake City, I recommend that you visit the Church History Museum. This is the organization that every two years sponsors an exhibition of Mormon art from around the world. The work of artists from Ghana, Argentina, Tokyo, Samoa, everywhere is put on display—a marvelous introduction to the global church.</p>
<p>Recently the Museum installed a new permanent exhibition on the first floor, the first thing you see as you enter. The aim of the exhibition is to introduce visitors to the church through art, historical documents, and historical objects. The previous permanent exhibition told the story of the gathering. It was filled will displays of the pioneers crossing the plains to Utah and then of converts from around the world migrating &nbsp;from Britain, Denmark, Italy and so on. This is one of the Church’s great stories and the museum did a great job of dramatizing the arduous journey and the faith that was required to uproot, travel long distances, and establish a new home in the West.</p>
<p>The new exhibition tells a different story—the story of the Restoration. It begins with accounts of people who were searching for new light at the beginning of the 19th century. They yearned for revelation and direction from heaven and could not find it. Then the exhibition displays a picture of Joseph Smith searching the scripture and invites you into a theater where the First Vision is reenacted in film. The film is projected in a round room to show a wooded grove surrounding you about 270 degrees. A tall young man walks into this grove, prays, and the light appears. The revelation that was looked for by so many seekers has at last come.</p>
<p>Emerging from the theater, you encounter displays that tell the story of the Book of Mormon followed by the other events of the Restoration down to Joseph Smith’s death. This is our great story: in modern times the Gospel has been restored; Christianity has been refreshed by a wave of revelations preparing the world for Christ’s return. The story is told with the latest technology, brightly lit, colorful displays, and objects from the past. One item is the string that bound the manuscript of the Book of Mormon when it was being taken to the press.</p>
<p>This is a familiar story for Latter-day Saints. We hear it the minute we begin to investigate the Church or attend junior Sunday School. But going through the exhibit for the first time, I noticed some new features. One was in the filming room where the First Vision was reenacted on the screen. As the film begins, words appear on the screen explaining that there are nine versions of the First Vision and this presentation draws on all of them. On a stand as you exit the theater is a notebook containing all of these accounts in full, with the parts that are incorporated into the film script printed in bold.</p>
<p>That is a new addition to the story—nine accounts of the First Vision when previously we had known only one, the one that appears in Pearl of Great Price as Joseph Smith I. This canonical account was written, so far as we know, in 1838 when the First Presidency set out to write the History of the Church. We know this account well. We treat it as scripture. It has been published separately as a tract to give to investigators. It is frequently referred to in talks and writings about the Restoration.</p>
<p>Now the Church Museum is going beyond this one familiar account to draw on multiple accounts of the First Vision. This may surprise some Church members. Not everyone has been aware of the existence of these other records and may be startled to discover that other versions exist. Contemplating what to say to you today, I thought you might be interested in hearing how it came about that we have these other accounts when for so long there was just one. Even more important, how does this new knowledge affect our understanding of Joseph Smith and the Gospel?</p>
<p>The discovery of nine versions of the First Vision is the result of work by historians in response to a challenge from critics of the Church. The standard account found in Joseph Smith’s History of the Church is so rich and interesting that for many years we were content to rely on it alone. Then in the middle of the twentieth century, a number of critics of Joseph Smith, including Fawn Brodie author of a biography of the Prophet, asked why was the account of the First Vision not written until 1838. Brodie thought that so spectacular an event should have been recorded earlier--if it had actually happened. Brodie hypothesized that Joseph Smith made up the whole story in 1838 to reinvigorate belief at a time when many of his followers were falling away. The first vision, she argued, was a fabrication meant to strengthen the faith of his wavering followers.</p>
<p>Church historians of course could not leave that challenge unanswered. They thought Brodie made a weak argument but without evidence of an earlier account, her conjecture might persuade some. And so the hunt was on. The historians began to scour the archives for earlier references to the First Vision. And sure enough, one by one, other accounts began to turn up, one in 1835, another as early at 1832, and others scattered through his life. Brodie’s claim that Joseph had said nothing about the First Vision until 1838 was effectively dispelled. He wrote the first of these accounts in 1832 as a start on a history of the church which he hoped to continue in a daily journal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historians’ research accomplished their purpose of answering Fawn Brodie, but the acquisition of other records of the First Vision had an added value. What more can we learn about the Vision by looking at these various accounts more carefully? Each one naturally differs in detail from the others. They all talk about the Lord appearing and giving a message to Joseph, but they are like the gospels in the New Testament. Each one has a different emphasis and gives us a somewhat different view of the event. What can we learn from these added accounts??</p>
<p>I am particularly attracted to the first of the accounts, the one written in 1832. As I have suggested, it was a season when Joseph was trying to improve his record-keeping. He had received the command to keep a record at the time the church was organized and tried as best he could, but like us in our journal keeping, his record was spotty. In 1832 he was trying again. The account of the Vision was part of his new resolve, the first time he sat down to explain how it all began.</p>
<p>The record is particularly interesting because large parts of it were written in his own hand and the rest he dictated to Frederick G. Williams. Because it came from his own hand and his own voice, we have good reason to believe that it came from his own mind. It was not polished or shaped by an editor as frequently happened with other writings attributed to Joseph. It rolls forth in a rush of words, not well punctuated and not carefully organized, the kind of thing an untrained writer would produce when trying to get down his memories. To me the account is very appealing.</p>
<p>The 1832 account is not complete. It says nothing about the revivals that so confused Joseph, or about reading James 1:5—if any of you lack wisdom.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> It does not mention darkness overpowering Joseph before the light came, and it does not mention God the Father, only that the Lord appeared. That does not mean these things did not occur, only that in summing up what happened, Joseph chose to record some things and not others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the 1832 account omits some parts of the whole story, but it also adds things missing from the familiar story. The emphasis in the 1838 account is on confusion about the churches; which one was the Lord’s. The 1832 account emphasizes worthiness. It says that “my mind become seriously impress [p. 1]with regard to the all important concerns [of] for the well fare of my immortal Soul” Joseph was worried not just about the state of the churches, but about his own soul. He goes on to say “my mind become exceedingly distressed for I become convicted of my sins” &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have always known that Joseph was disillusioned with church people he knew. They did not adorn “their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation,” he wrote in 1832. He concluded that “mankind&gt; . . . had apostatized from the true and living &nbsp;faith and there was no society or denomination &nbsp;that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as &nbsp;recorded in the new testament.” But that was not his only question when he went to pray. He was as worried about his own worthiness, as he was concerned about the religions around him. As he put it in 1832, “I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world.”</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise then that 1832 account deals with sin and forgiveness. Here is Joseph’s 1832 description of what happened:</p>
<p>“a piller of &nbsp;fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day &nbsp;come down from above and rested upon me and I was filled &nbsp;with the spirit of god and the &lt;Lord&gt; opened the heavens upon &nbsp;me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying &nbsp;Joseph &lt;my son&gt; thy sins are forgiven thee. go thy &lt;way&gt; walk in my &nbsp;statutes and keep my commandments.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>I like that passage because the first thing the Savior did was to forgive Joseph and urge him to repent. The first act of the restoration was to put the soul of the Lord’s prophet into order. After granting forgiveness, Christ went on to remind Joseph of the atonement: “behold I am the &nbsp;Lord of glory I was crucified for the world that all those who believe on my name may have Eternal life.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>To my way of thinking this account throws a new light on the Restoration. The 1838 account, the traditional one emphasizes the problem of churches; which church is true? The 1832 story brings redemption to the fore--forgiveness and atonement. Even the prophet of the Lord stands before God in need of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Once this emphasis is found in the account of the First Vision, our attention is drawn to the importance of forgiveness throughout Joseph’s life. We remember that concern for his sins led to his second momentous prayer when Moroni appeared. The 1832 account says “I fell into transgressions and sinned in many things which brought a wound upon my soul.” Once again he prayed and “an angel of the Lord came and stood before me and it was by night and he called me by name and he said the Lord had forgiven me my sins.” We have no reason to believe that Joseph’s sins were grievous, but they troubled him. Had he offended the God who had appeared to him out of the heavens? Was he worthy of continued favor? That question is what drove him to pray again.</p>
<p>We may think that this concern for his sins was the anxiety of a young man, still undisciplined in the ways of the Lord. Once he got on to the prophetic track as an adult, concern about his sins would dissipate. But that did not happen. Christ appeared in the Kirtland Temple in April 1836, and among his first words were again “Behold your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore lift up your heads and rejoice.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> Perhaps because the prophet was close to the Lord, he was in special need of forgiveness when he came into Christ’s presence, but it also appears that whatever our position in the Church, forgiveness is basic to our spiritual lives.</p>
<p>I once preached a sermon along these lines to a group of LDS men doing time in prison. When I was given the assignment, I had wondered what it would be like to meet Latter-day Saints convicted of a crime. It was a disconcerting experience. The prisoners marched in wearing orange jump suits, and to my surprise, shook our hands, looked us in the eye, and welcomed us to the prison. They seemed very much like people I would meet in any ward meeting. I wondered for a moment what really was the difference between them and the people I met in church each week. The prisoners were returned missionaries and former high councilors who had made mistakes. They were apparently sincere men who had fallen into crime. They of course loved my sermon on forgiveness. They hungered for the assurance of forgiveness and took hope in hearing that Joseph Smith the prophet of the Lord had turned to God for forgiveness too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We catch a glimpse of what forgiveness meant to Joseph in his letters to Emma. He revealed more of himself to her than to anyone–even his brother Hyrum. In 1832, on his way back to Kirtland from Missouri, Joseph had to stop in Indiana after Newell K. Whitney broke his leg in a runaway carriage accident. For a month Joseph was forced into inactivity, and without something to do, became melancholy. Deep regrets about his life came flooding back. He wrote to Emma that he went every day to a grove outside the town to pray.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have Called to mind all the past moments of my life and am left to morn and Shed tears of sorrow for my folly in Suffering the adversary of my Soul to have so much power over me as he has had in times past but God is merciful and has f[o]rgiven my Sins and I r[e]joice that he Sendeth forth the Comforter unto as many as believe and humbleth themselves before him.” He sounded very much like Nephi in 2 Nephi 4 who lamented: “O wretched man that I am.”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Both men felt deeply the need for mercy and forgiveness.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>After telling Emma of his misery, thoughts of death came to him. Joseph wrote:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I will try to be contented with my lot knowing that God is my friend &nbsp; &nbsp;in him I shall find comfort &nbsp; &nbsp;I have <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>given my life into his hands &nbsp; I am prepared to go at his Call &nbsp; I desire to be with Christ &nbsp; &nbsp;I Count not my life <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>dear to me only to do his will.</p>
<p>It sounds like sorrowful life to be forever repenting of your sins and seeking forgiveness as Joseph and Nephi did. But in actuality, repentance and forgiveness lead to hope and resilience. We all fall short from time to time. We make mistake and look foolish or hurt people. We build up many regrets about our lives and can be burdened down by memories of our failures and errors. We can become quite depressed and weakened by a sense of failure and sin The doctrine of continuous forgiveness acknowledges that this will be true of us all. It may be unavoidable that we constantly stumble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we need never be borne down by our shortcomings and sins. It is built into the nature of the universe that we if approach God with a broken heart and pray in the name of Christ, we will be forgiven and renewed. It is a doctrine that gives us courage, hope, and the ability to move on. Joseph’s lamentations did not debilitate him. He was not crippled by his regrets. He put his faith in Christ, pled for forgiveness, and went on to magnificent achievements. To me that is what the 1832 account of the First Vision promises us—a God who will forgive us and lift the burden of sin from our backs. Even those men in prison for their sins and crimes can take hope.</p>
<p>Forgiveness then is the first lesson I derive from the 1832 First Vision account. The second has to do with a peculiar fact about its usage. Joseph did not publish this story once it was written. He did not print the account in the church newspaper or add it to the Book of Commandments which was about to appear. So far as we know the 1832 account was never read in a church meeting. It was buried away in church records until discovered by a historian in the 1960s.</p>
<p>This withholding of the 1832 account was typical of the first decade of the Church. Very little was made of the First Vision in Church teachings until 1839 when for the first time the story of the vision appeared in print, in an account by Orson Pratt. The familiar 1838 account was not published until 1842. Joseph mentioned his experience to a visitor to Kirtland in 1835, but did not tell the story in any sermon we know about. Likely no more than a handful of Latter-day Saints had even heard of the First Vision before 1839.</p>
<p>Its notable absence from Church writings until 1839 is quite surprising. Parley Pratt published the most influential early Mormon tract, The Voice of Warning, in 1837. It summed up the Mormon message at that time without mentioning Joseph Smith’s name, much less his First Vision. Pratt emphasized the return of revelation without seeing a need to name the revelator, or describe the vision that launched the Restoration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This puzzling absence moves us to ask: What was the message in that first decade? If Joseph Smith was not seeking to promote himself as a prophet, what was he promoting? What was the message if not a new prophet? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer of course is perfectly clear in the revelations themselves. The Book of Mormon proclaims its purpose on its title page: “the convincing of Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.” All the revelations, point in the same direction. The Preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, section 1 says the prophet was called that “the fullness of the gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The one scripture we hear more than any other in the Church is Doctrine and Covenants 20:77 and 79, the sacrament prayers. Every Sunday in our services we are invited to spend time contemplating Christ’s sacrifice. In the sacrament, we witness to God that we are willing to take upon us the name of his Son and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given us that we may always have his spirit to be with us.</p>
<p>A member of our ward in Manhattan tells of a time in college when he was questioning the Book of Mormon. Could he believe the story of Nephites and Lamanites? Was the Book of Mormon historically authentic? During this time of struggle and doubt, he prayed for guidance about the book’s value. Eventually, he says, the answer came. In his mind he heard the words: “Did it not bring you to me?” For him that was the payoff. He had found the Savior in the pages of the Book of Mormon. That is what the book was intended to do. That is what Joseph would want to come out of his work: for us to believe in Christ.</p>
<p>Sometimes this deep infusion of Christ into modern revelation does not achieve its purpose in people’s lives. Some people’s faith is based more on Joseph Smith than on Jesus Christ. When they begin to question the Prophet, they lose faith in the Savior. We all know of Latter-day Saints whose faith is shaken by new facts, such as the existence of the alternate accounts of the First Vision which I have talked about today. When this new information builds up, they grow concerned. Could it all be wrong? Their consternation goes so far that they consider leaving the church, painful as that would be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a long time, I would try to answer their specific questions, try to persuade them there was another way of understanding the facts that were bothering them. I reminded them that people like me and many other informed Latter-day Saints are aware of all the disruptive information and still believe in Joseph Smith. We would talk for hours, but nothing seemed to work. After all the talk, they seemed as fixed in their doubts as I am in my faith.</p>
<p>Of late, I have taken to asking the doubters a question? How do you feel about Jesus Christ? If they say the Savior means everything to them, I assure them, you will be all right. If you can hold to Christ, you will find your way. But to my dismay, others say that in losing faith in Joseph Smith, they also lose faith in Christ and even in God and prayer. Everything falls apart. I feel bad when I hear this response. It means that Joseph Smith, not the Savior, is the foundation of their faith. Once Joseph is removed, the whole building collapses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not what Joseph intended. He did not organize a Church of Joseph Smith. The Articles of Faith do not mention Joseph Smith’s name. They begin with the statement we believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. That is the foundation.</p>
<p>Those who lose faith in Christ because they have lost faith in Joseph Smith have things backward. Joseph’s mission was to increase faith in Christ, not in himself. He thought of himself as one of the weak things of the world who came forth that faith might increase in the earth and that Christ’s everlasting covenant might be established.<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></span>&nbsp;He would want us to develop faith in his teachings, in Christ and the atonement, in prayer and adhesion to high moral standards, not in him as a man. He would want us to believe in the principles independent of the man, as the Saints in the first decade did. We honor him as a prophet, to be sure, but as one who testified of the Savior. His revelations pointed beyond himself to Christ and the Father. I believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet of God, and most of you here today do too. But we must place our faith first in Christ, and believe in him apart from our faith in his messenger. Christ should be the anchor when we struggle and question.</p>
<p>We now benefit from having not just one but many accounts of the First Vision, each one offering a different perspective. The Vision is a powerful source of faith. It helps my faith to know that someone in our own era saw God. But we should keep in mind the Vision’s purpose: it was to testify of the Lord. That Christ will come first in our faith, that he will be the foundation, that we will enjoy forgiveness and renewal through His atonement, I pray in Christ’s name, amen.</p>

<p>8 November 2016<br />Susan W. Tanner<br />First Lady, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>One of my earliest memories is of sitting on my Grandma Winder’s back porch in the early morning sun, eating her hot homemade “brown” bread dripping with melted butter and honey. For the first thirteen years of my life, before her passing, I lived next door in rural Granger, Utah, to my grandpa and my grandma, Alma Eliza Cannon Winder. Grandma’s influence upon me was profound. I felt loved and cherished by her. Later as I’ve learned more about her life, I have come to know that this loving act of sharing her bread with me was representative of her constant kindnesses to others. Her goodness came from her natural optimism and her faith in God. This faith helped her endure life’s inevitable trials. She epitomized to me a woman who could “stand on her feet and go forward by putting her trust and faith in [God]”.<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Let me tell you a little about this ordinary, yet extraordinary woman, so you can learn lessons of faith and service from her, as I have learned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Grandma, I am connected to Hawaii. She is the granddaughter of George Q. Cannon, who as many of you know, was among the first group of LDS missionaries to serve in these islands in 1850. After their first discouraging months, some of that group of young men defected and left the mission. But George Q. Cannon determined to stay and fulfill the call he had received from an apostle of the Lord. Through both diligent work and miraculous blessings he brought the Gospel to many prepared Hawaiians. Also he and one of those converts, Jonathan Napela, translated the Book of Mormon into the Hawaiian language. We are meeting today in a building that bears his name. Outside there is a statue of George Q. Cannon and Jonathan Napela. As a family we feel a huge debt of gratitude for this legacy of faith, diligence, and service George Q. Cannon has passed on to us.</p>
<p>With that heritage, imagine how excited my grandma and grandpa must have been to receive a mission call to serve in Hawaii together immediately after they were married. They came here on their honeymoon and stayed for 2 ½ years. They attended the dedication of the temple here in Laie and then served most of their mission in Hilo on the Big Island. Their first daughter, Barbara, was born while they were there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have the opportunity to also serve a type of mission here, I think of them every day. I think of their diligent effort to learn the language, their sacrifice to leave their families (with no technology for immediate communication), their courage to have their first baby so far from home (with no modern conveniences), and their great love for the people and for the Lord. Their example of faith is a great strength to me. Their cheerfulness in the face of challenges motivates me to try to be more like them.</p>
<p>They lived as President Gordon B. Hinckley admonished us when he said we should stand on our feet and move forward. He repeatedly told us to rise to the divinity within us, to be the best we can be. He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Never lose sight of the great reassuring power of the Atonement of the Savior to lift and save. . . Do not nag yourself with a sense of failure. . . Do the best you can. . . get on your knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction. . . then stand on your feet and move forward. I am absolutely confident that heaven will smile upon [you]. The Lord will hear and answer your prayers if you will commit yourselves, giving your very best to this work. . . Then you will discover that you have accomplished something beyond price.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I think of this counsel in five simple parts: (1) Don’t nag yourself with feelings of failure; (2) Get on your knees and plead with the Lord; (3) Get on your feet and go forward; (4) Trust in the Lord, and (5) (a promise) You will find you have accomplished something beyond price. This counsel reminds us to have faith in Jesus Christ, following his example as He prayed for strength to know the will of the Father and then did it, accomplishing something beyond price in behalf of each of us.</p>
<p>My grandma lived this way. She was optimistic despite her trials. She gave no place for self-pity. She “went about doing good”<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup>, as Jesus Christ did, choosing to forget herself in service to others. She endured to the end with patience and even much good humor. Her determined faith in Jesus Christ and modeling of his goodness not only carried her through her challenges, but left for her posterity a legacy beyond price.</p>
<p>Grandma was a naturally happy person. She was positive in her outlook and very social in her love for other people. Yet as a young mother she knew deep sorrow. Tragedy struck twice–first with the death of little, Hawaiian-born Barbara, their firstborn child, and then later with the untimely death of another little daughter, Helen Margaret. Grandma tells in intermittent journal entries a few details about the circumstances and her feelings about the deaths of these two little girls. She says about 6-year-old Barbara:</p>
<p>“Oh, the whole thing is such a horrible nightmare. On January 30th Mother stayed out here and [Barbara] was very sick, so the next morning we took her in, intending to go right to the hospital, but [the doctor] advised us not to so we stayed at Mother’s. . . The next day we went to the doctor and . . . he was very reassuring. . . . She seemed so much improved. However after dinner she began going delirious and by 5 o’clock was right out of her head. The last word she ever said was “That’s all.” When I think of that night I turn cold, for dear little Babs nearly died. . . she was taken to the hospital immediately. . . five nights I spent at the hospital. She never regained consciousness and it was pitiful to watch her. Tuesday she nearly died again, but rallied. They got meningitis serum in her and she seemed better. . . . It first helped but Saturday she became worse, and Saturday night she was gone. When she was gone there was no hope, but before I had never given up hope. I just felt at first like I couldn’t stand to live without her, but when I saw Ed (her husband and my grandpa) and the boys I knew I would have to live for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is now nearly two months after and oh, my heart just aches. I sometimes think I am unequal to the task of going on without her. I am sure I couldn’t have stood it if Ed and the kiddies and everyone hadn’t been so nice. Oh, but I loved Babs and miss her so. Little would anyone dream from the outside appearances just how lonesome I am for my darling.” (Journal of Alma Eliza Cannon Winder, in family’s possession).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I read this journal, my heart also aches. But I feel Grandma’s great inner strength as she carries on and continues to care for her other family members in the midst of her sorrow. Giving that needed service was actually crucial in helping her cope with her sadness.</p>
<p>There are no specific journal entries about Helen Margaret’s death. But other children in the family recall that when she was about two and a half months of age she suddenly became ill and was also hospitalized for a week before she died. As a mother myself, I can imagine the devastation my grandparents must have felt to lose another daughter. Yet in spite of her suffering, Grandma chose to exert her faith in Jesus Christ and move forward, living for her husband and other children. It was her eternal commitment to her family that moved her forward. She said that these trials helped her to be more empathetic and kind with others in their challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in her life when I lived next to her, she suffered from a blood disease that I never knew anything about. To me, she was simply my loving grandma who read to me, invited me to tea parties, brought homemade soup to me when I was sick, taught me how to laugh at myself, and always had hot homemade brown bread coming from her oven. She never mentioned the disease, but since then I have read occasional journal entries where she mentions what a sore trial this was. Here is part of her journal: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am 61 and my skin has been broken out about 7 years. It came on all of a sudden. They don’t seem to know just what it is. The eruption leaves in the summer. I am writing this so if any of you children ever have the same thing, develop the philosophy I have tried to develop. ‘Things that can’t be cured must be endured.’ It has been a great trial to me, but I am sure I have been more tolerant of people and tried to be sweeter and kinder because of it.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>A year later she wrote, “I still have my skin disease after about 8 years. . . . I used to feel so peppy and now I have felt kind of sick most of the time. . . . Even so, it could be worse and I am thankful I am alive. Dad (my grandpa) has been such a darling, understanding fellow in spite of my blemishes – Bless him– I will always be grateful to him.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Her last entry came a month before she died about 8 years later. She said, “My skin trouble has taken a turn for the worse. . . lumps have developed on my side and back. They are bad sores . . . but I am grateful to my Heavenly Father for letting me live this long. Dad has been so good, kind and sweet to me.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I read her journal now, knowing what I now know about her 17-year long illness, I am astonished at how few times she mentions her debilitating disease in her journals -- and never to us. Instead, she focuses on the welfare of her family and friends, and expresses joy in life. Only after her death did we learn that Grandma died from what was then a rare blood cancer manifesting itself in skin flare-ups. Only then did we glimpse what the Grandma who loved to laugh with us, to invite us for hot homemade bread, and to ask us about our “beaux,” had so graciously endured. “What cannot be cured, must be endured.” And she endured it so well!</p>
<p>Grandma and Grandpa had always loved Hawaii so deeply that they vowed to share their experiences with their family. It was in this final year of her life that Grandpa insisted that we take this trip as an entire family (over 30 people) to Hawaii. One of their sons with his family was serving a mission at the time. The rest of us said we could wait until they returned home from their mission in the coming year, but Grandpa was determined that we had to go immediately. Only he knew the seriousness of Grandma’s illness, so he insisted that we take the trip quickly, though we did not know why. Grandma died several months after we returned from that family trip to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Here was a woman who didn’t dwell on her feelings of inadequacy or her trials. Instead she got on her knees and prayed for strength, then got on her feet and went forward cheerfully serving her family and neighbors, trusting in Heavenly Father and enduring to the end. She lived by her own motto that if something could not be cured, it could and must be endured. Grandma not only endured, she prevailed. She refused to wallow in self-pity. Instead, she reached out to others in compassion, in kindness. She was as King Benjamin taught us that we should be “meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon us.” All the years I knew her, she was sick, but I never knew it. Her legacy of goodness, patience in suffering, and endurance with a smile is something beyond price for each of her posterity.</p>
<p>One of Grandma’s secrets, I think, is that she learned to endure and be happy by losing herself in service to others. She embodied the truth taught by the Savior to his disciples: “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: &nbsp;but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I remember Pres. Monson’s poignant illustration of this. He said that a distinguished medical doctor, Dr. McConnel who helped develop the polio vaccine, the medicine Tylenol, and the procedure of MRI’s, created at the end of his career “an organization called Volunteers in Medicine. This gives retired medical personnel a chance to volunteer at free clinics serving the working uninsured. Dr. McConnell said his leisure time since he retired has evaporated into 60-hour weeks of unpaid work, but [his] energy level has increased and there is a satisfaction in [his] life that wasn’t there before.’ He made this statement: ‘In one of those paradoxes of life, I have benefited more from Volunteers in Medicine than my patients have.’”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Likewise, I think Grandma may have felt that way. Grandma’s many kindnesses to others may have been the healing balm that got her through her daily struggles. Certainly it diverted her thinking about her own woes to others with their troubles.</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf and President Russell M. Nelson have taught us about joy. They both taught that it does not come to us because of happy circumstances, but rather in the midst of any circumstances. And the joy comes to us through the way we choose to respond to what is happening.</p>
<p>My mother began teaching me at a young age this same important lesson, to forget my own problems by thinking of and helping others through theirs. On my first nervous day of kindergarten, my mother held my hand as we walked into the classroom. Across the room, sitting by herself was a little girl who was crying. “Oh Susie,” my mom said to me, “you must go and be her friend.” My mother let go of my hand and suddenly I forgot my own fears as I obediently set out to help someone else.</p>
<p>This is the 2nd day of a new semester. Many of you may feel lonely or homesick or unsure in your classes or your relationships or troubled in some way by other circumstances here. I promise you that you will feel better about any of your personal challenges if you find someone else who has it equally hard or even harder and forget yourself to help them. Pres. David O. McKay said, “Man’s greatest happiness comes from losing himself for the good of others.” It is a gospel truth; it works like magic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandma shared both intangible kindnesses of the heart and tangible kindnesses of the hands. Among Grandma’s tangible kindnesses were pots of soup for the sick, dairy products for the neighbors, and hot loaves of bread for anyone in need. When the tangible goods were delivered, others’ spirits were lifted, and often they would share feelings of their hearts. She followed what King Benjamin taught: “I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally."<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a sense Grandma’s simple loaves of brown bread were miracle loaves which have miraculously multiplied over the years, as we, her daughters and sons, granddaughters and grandsons have tried symbolically and literally to share bread with others. Sharing blesses the giver and the receiver, and sometimes, as with Jesus Christ, five small loaves may miraculously feed more than five thousand hungry, needy people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the giver, the effort may sometimes feel like jogging uphill feels to me. Even the slightest incline requires so much effort. But once I have made that effort and I’m on the downward slope, I say over and over to myself, “Now let the road carry you.” When we are in the midst of a personal challenge, if we can make that huge uphill effort to think of others in need and serve them, then that very act will carry us over our hills of discouragement. And the road can carry us the rest of the way toward renewed purpose and hope. Perhaps in a sense Grandma’s kindnesses to others helped carry her through her own problems.</p>
<p>I remember a day when I was serving as Young Women President when sharing some loaves of bread carried me through some struggles. After first getting on my knees and praying fervently for answers and strength to deal with my problems, I felt impressed to rise to my feet and make a dozen little loaves of whole wheat bread to take with me to the office. Each time I gave one away, the recipient opened his or her heart and shared some tender feelings. A secretary said, “How did you know it was my birthday; no one else has remembered me.” A much admired general authority lamented, “Some days I wish I had at least one thing like making bread, that I could do well.” The parents of an open-heart surgery patient confided, “Let us share with you the priesthood miracles involved with this surgery for our daughter.” &nbsp;An executive director said, “I will give this to my wife who is sitting each day in the hospital with our daughter who has leukemia.” Another leader reminisced, “This brings my mother back to me, because she too made bread.” These little experiences leavened my day with the spirit and carried me through that day. My burdens had been lifted. I felt happy.</p>
<p>President Hinckley said: “Do you want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause. Lend your efforts to helping people. Look to the Lord and live and work to lift and serve His sons and daughters. You will come to know a happiness that you have never known before if you will do that. . . You can lift people and help them. Heaven knows there are so very, very, very many people in this world who need help. Let us stand a little taller and reach a little higher in the service of others.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our own way each of us can be part of the miracle of the loaves. President David O. McKay talked about the miracle of a leavening influence coming from this university. He said, “This school is going to produce. . . leaders. . . who are true to the ideals, who will leaven the whole lump. . . influencing not thousands, not tens of thousands, but millions”.<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup> Like the leaven that makes bread bigger and bigger, light and delicious, we can be the leaven in the world that makes the influence of the Gospel grow and spread.</p>
<p>The little loaves I gave away then and over the years became miracle loaves for me as much or more than for those with whom I shared them. Just like Grandma’s loaves. On those summer mornings of my childhood, Grandma gave me more than hot brown bread dripping with butter and honey. Little did I realize that she was giving me something far more precious and lasting. She was giving an example of service, faith, courage, and endurance that has sustained and nourished my soul over the years. She taught me what it meant to get on your knees everyday to ask Heavenly Father to bless you, and then exerting your trust and faith in Him, stand on your feet and forget yourself by cheerfully going about doing good. As a result of her daily choice not to nag herself or others with feelings of failure but to stand on her feet and serve, she accomplished something of great price. Her loaves of kindness, not only helped her through her own challenges, but also &nbsp;have been multiplied through the generations, nourishing and leavening multitudes, thus becoming miracle loaves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find a little loaf of bread under your seat today, I encourage you to make it a miracle loaf. Share it. Share your goodness. Share your faith. Your righteousness, your cheerfulness, your selflessness can have a leavening influence on our university and community now, creating Zion among us.</p>
<p>I know that the day of miracles has not ceased and that Heavenly Father is a God of miracles. He loves each one of us, and He will bless us through our trials as we exert our faith in Jesus Christ, who is the sustaining Bread of Life. I know we must follow His example of love, service, and endurance as our prophet of God, President Thomas S. Monson has taught. He has promised us that if we exert our faith in Jesus Christ when we face hard things, we will be blessed. He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“I testify to you that our promised blessings are beyond measure. Though the storm clouds may gather, though the rains may pour down upon us, our knowledge of the gospel and our love of our Heavenly Father and of our Savior will comfort and sustain us and bring joy to our hearts as we walk uprightly and keep the commandments. There will be nothing in this world that can defeat us.. . .fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith.”<span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><sup><a href="#FN9">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p>May each of us participate in our own miracle of the loaves by putting our trust and faith in the very Bread of Life, Jesus Christ and leavening the earth with the good works of His Gospel.</p>
