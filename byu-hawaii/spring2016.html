<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>I trust you had a wonderful Memorial holiday weekend. I hope you were able to reflect upon those who sacrificed their lives that we may enjoy the freedoms and blessings we have in this great nation. To all of you who have served and those of you who continue to serve, I say thank you.</p>
<p>I am grateful to be here with you on this wonderful island at this consecrated learning institution. You are magnifying your God-given talents and preparing yourselves to become better able and ready to serve the Lord in helping his kingdom grow on the earth.</p>
<p>I believe my choices of becoming baptized into the Church, receiving the Priesthood, serving a mission, marrying in the temple and completing my education have developed and lead me to be the person I am today. Even decisions I made while serving in the Tahiti Papeete Mission affected who I am. The Papeete Tahiti Temple was under construction at that time. I really wanted to participate in that project. I was reminded that my purpose at that time was to be a missionary, not to build temples. I feel so blessed that 13 years later I was able to fulfill that desire to build temples. My testimony, although founded on sound principles and doctrine, was enhanced through the agency I used and experiences my Father in Heaven gave me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned early in my career with the Church that there are four overriding principles I must follow to be successful in building temples:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. “Trust in the Spirit of the Lord which leadeth to do good” <a href="#FN1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. Remember that “it is not meet that [the Lord] should command in all things” <a href="#FN2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. Go forward with faith by “cheerfully doing all things that lie in your power”, <a href="#FN3">[3]</a> and then</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4. “Stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed” <a href="#FN4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Let’s look at these principles in a little more detail by turning to the scriptures.</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trust in the Spirit of the Lord which leadeth to do good</span></p>
<p>The Lord loves each and every one of us. He wishes us to succeed in returning home to Him. His gift to us is the Holy Ghost. We strive each week to take accountability for our choices by repenting of our wrong doings and covenanting to always remember Him and keep his commandments. In return, we have the assurance that His Spirit will always be with us. We have been taught that the Spirit will teach you all things that you must know with knowledge and enlightenment given “line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little.” <a href="#FN5">[5]</a></p>
<p>In the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon, the brother of Jared provided us with many experiences where his spiritual preparation gave him an opportunity to be tutored by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>One such experience was when the brother of Jared was commanded to build barges to cross the sea that they may inherit a land which was choice above all other lands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brother of Jared built the barges tight like unto a dish. He cried unto the Lord, “in them there is no light … And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall perish.” The Lord responded by saying, “thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air.” <a href="#FN6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The brother of Jared was a man of God and conducted himself in a way that allowed the Lord to openly communicate with him. The brother of Jared received an answer and was given a solution to only one of his concerns – how to get air in the barges. He did not receive an answer to his concern regarding light in the vessels.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember that “it is not meet that [the Lord] should command in all things”</span></p>
<p>The Lord wishes us to grow and learn as we make our own decisions. He also wants us to counsel with him in all our doings.</p>
<p>When the barges were built, the brother of Jared again cried to the Lord and exclaimed that he had accomplished the work that he was commanded to do, which was to add holes in the barges for air. The brother of Jared said, “behold there is not light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?” The Lord replied, “What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?” <a href="#FN7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Far too often we ask the Lord to resolve our problems without taking any thought beforehand of what we should do. We are endowed with intelligence and we must use it.</p>
<p>The question posed to the brother of Jared by the Lord is like asking, “What are your thoughts? Is there anything you can think of doing that would provide light in your vessels? Why don’t you think about it and come back when you have a solution.”</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go forward with faith by “cheerfully doing all things that lie in your power”</span></p>
<p>Surely the brother of Jared spent time pondering, praying and fasting upon the question from the Lord before coming up with an idea, which was to molten out of rock sixteen small stones. His action of producing out of rock sixteen small stones was a demonstration of his faith. He actively pursued a solution to his problem.</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee said, “This is the principle in action. If you want the blessing, don’t just kneel down and pray about it. Prepare yourselves in every conceivable way you can in order to make yourselves worthy to receive the blessing you seek.” <a href="#FN8">[8]</a></p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed”</span></p>
<p>It surely challenged the brother of Jared to find a solution that would provide light without harming the people, the animals and the vessels. Producing the small stones was not a simple task. The rocks would have to be intensely heated and formed. He had to find the proper materials and work it to become white and clear, even as transparent glass. He believed the Lord had all power and that by asking the Lord to touch the stones, light would emanate from them. He did all he could do and relied completely upon the Lord’s grace to reveal his arm by performing a miracle of faith.</p>
<p>And the Lord did perform a miracle. He stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger to illuminate them so the brother of Jared and his people could cross the great waters in light rather than darkness.</p>
<p>In 2004, I was managing the completion of the Manhattan New York Temple project.</p>
<p>As a Church Project Manager, I was responsible to hire a professional construction company to ensure that the design approved by the First Presidency and Presiding Bishopric was indeed delivered on schedule and according to the design.</p>
<p>The temple in Manhattan is very unique. It was constructed within an existing multi-level, multi-use building that required an interior renovation to become a temple. The only other temple to have multiple uses within the structure of the building is the Hong Kong China Temple. When we began, the temple design was comprised of a part of the ground floor for the Baptistery and the fifth and sixth floors for other ordinance and administrative spaces. The second, third and fourth floors of the building were used by the members as meetinghouse space.</p>
<p>Through the course of the project the temple space grew to include a clothing issue and Public Affairs offices on the second floor and some other administrative office spaces on the fourth floor. Another item added was a steeple topped by an Angel Moroni statue. When new space is added to a project it requires new designs, modifications to the contract, additional funds and additional time. We try to incorporate enough time in the project to accommodate some minor changes, but not to the extent of the changes required to complete the Manhattan New York Temple.</p>
<p>When I was asked to add a steeple and Angel Moroni to the temple, we had completed the interior finishes of one of the endowment rooms on the fifth floor and the Public Affairs offices on the second floor. Because the steeple was to be placed upon the outside corner of the building, the structural design required us to run steel columns and beams from the underground parking level of the building to the roof. The general contractor had to remove and replace all of the newly placed finishes to accommodate the new design.</p>
<p>With only 3.5 months remaining to the temple dedication, I received instructions to replace the exterior façade to the temple on the street level, which consisted of commercial storefronts which were not consistent with the exterior of a temple.</p>
<p>This may seem like a simple task of replacing a wall, but my efforts were met with insurmountable obstacles that only the hand of the Lord could overcome.</p>
<p>I prescribe to a technique taught by President Gordon B. Hinckley as described in his book entitled, Standing for Something. President Hinckley said,</p>
<p>“If there is any one thing that you and I need, to help us find success and fulfillment in this world it is faith – that dynamic powerful, marvelous element by which, as Paul declared, the very worlds were framed. I refer not to some ethereal concept but to a practical, pragmatic, working faith – the kind of faith that moves us to get on our knees and plead with the Lord for guidance, and then, having a measure of divine confidence, get on our feet and go to work to help bring the desired results to pass.” <a href="#FN9">[9]</a></p>
<p>After pleading with the Lord for guidance on how to accomplish the task before me and not receiving an immediate answer to my prayer, I pondered the steps required to building the façade of the temple. I got on my feet and scheduled a meeting with the general contractor.</p>
<p>I sat across the table from the superintendent for the general contractor and relayed to him our latest challenge and dilemma. Picture in your mind a man already stressed and challenged to complete the project on time to allow the Open House to proceed as scheduled. Invitations had been sent to visiting VIPs and there was no latitude to extend the contract time to complete the project. President Hinckley scheduled the temple dedication almost one year earlier due to his tight schedule.</p>
<p>The superintendent, a non-member, sat silently for a moment before responding. He looked me in the eyes and said, “Cory, what you are asking us to do is impossible with the remaining time before the Open House and Dedication. You need to let your prophet know it cannot be done. Our company cannot take on that liability and will not do this added work.” Obviously, the superintendent didn’t know what a prophet was and from whom he received direction. My heart sank. I didn’t know what to do. I returned to my hotel in a daze, wondering how to proceed. I earnestly pondered the situation for a few days. After letting my supervisors know that the general contractor refused to help with this new directive and that I didn’t know how best to proceed, I went to my knees. I pleaded for guidance and direction. When I arose I reflected upon President Hinckley’s words and had a renewed confidence that I needed to pursue every possible solution to bring this task to completion. I could not see how the temple could realistically be completed on time, but I knew that if President Hinckley said the temple would be dedicated on a certain day, I had to commit to doing everything I could to make it happen.</p>
<p>And so the journey began. It was the beginning of March 2004. I had approximately 2.5 months before the Open House and 3.5 months before the Temple Dedication, which was scheduled for mid-June.</p>
<p>The architects had created a design for the façade or wall of the temple, but that was only the first step in the process. The façade design incorporated a large quantity of ¾” thick polished Italian marble. Other steps necessary to complete this task were to find and purchase the marble stone for the wall, produce shop drawings showing how the stone would be installed and fabricate the shop tickets, which tell the stone cutter the sizes in which to cut the stone. Then the stone needed to be installed and some kind of decorative landscaping element added to soften the look and feel of the walkway outside the temple.</p>
<p>Typically, it takes 4 – 6 months to receive a shipment of stone after the shop tickets are delivered to the stone fabricator or stone cutter. Having managed several temple projects previously, I was aware of some stone suppliers and fabricators. I called them to see if there was any ¾” thick polished Italian marble available. Within a week of informing the superintendent of the need to add a façade to the project design, I had called every stone supplier I knew of, but found no one that could help me.</p>
<p>While pursuing the stone, I also knew that I had to find someone to produce the stone shop tickets, which details each individual stone’s dimensions. I called several firms, but their work load prevented them from taking on another job, especially one that needed to be completed within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I was at a loss as to what to do next. Constantly seeking for guidance and trusting in the Spirit to provide that guidance, I continued to press forward calling and pleading with anyone I could think of. I spread word of my dilemma throughout the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>A week later one of the firms called me and asked if I still needed help in producing shop drawings and the stone shop tickets. Miraculously, a two-week window opened in the firm’s schedule that allowed them to take on this project. Two weeks was just the right amount of time required to complete the entire job. Almost in tears, I gratefully asked, “Yes, how soon can you begin?” We began producing the shop drawings and fabrication tickets without having any stone yet.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, about a month after my conversation with the project superintendent, I received a call from a stone supplier that said he had received a call from a loading dock in Los Angeles, California, that had a shipment of ¾” thick polished Italian marble sitting in a container. Apparently the buyer who purchased the stone many months earlier no longer needed or wanted the stone. The shipping container held the exact amount of stone we needed to within 10 square feet of what the design called for. I gratefully purchased the stone. Now I needed a place to send the stone to be cut and fabricated.</p>
<p>I placed several calls to find a stone fabricator, who would take the stone and cut it to the sizes specified by the designers. Every fabricator I called said their production lines were scheduled out for months and couldn’t be interrupted. Days later I was notified by a fabricator that he had a window suddenly become open and could cut the stone. I immediately called the individual who found the container of stone in Los Angeles and gave him an address to ship the stone. I then called the firm producing the shop drawings and fabrication tickets and requested that the drawings and tickets immediately be sent to the stone fabricator. The stone fabrication would take 3 – 5 weeks, meaning stone installation would commence a week or two before the Open House and continue until the time of the temple dedication.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the work to complete the interior of the temple continued. The superintendent watched in disbelief as things miraculously came together with the façade.</p>
<p>The final step in this process was to install the stone on the façade. I called several installers and none had the time or willingness to come to New York and install stone on such short notice. Once again the Lord intervened. Several days later I received a call from an out-of-state installer that said a project had fallen through and he now had a crew available to install stone if I still needed them. I called my superintendent and we arranged for the crew to come to New York when the first shipment of stone arrived, which was about the end of April. As the crew mobilized to begin work, we were again interrupted. Unions are very prominent in New York. The Union began to form picket lines at the temple site because our workers were not from New York. The designated completion date for the project was rapidly approaching, but once again the work was halted while we worked on toward an equitable solution. Through creative negotiating, we were able to resolve the union issue amicably and resume work. It was now the beginning of May and time for the Open House to begin. In spite of the numerous delays we had encountered, the work on the façade of the temple had steadily progressed, and of necessity, continued through the Open House. Even with this disruption, visitors could feel the sacredness of the temple. There were moments when I worried that the temple wouldn’t be completed in time for the dedication, but we continued to press forward. After many long days and long hours, the work was finally completed at the last possible moment. The last planter was placed in the temple entry within 30 minutes of President Hinckley’s arrival to tour the temple just prior to the dedication on June 13, 2004.</p>
<p>After the dedication of the Manhattan New York temple, the project superintendent approached me to say it was an absolute miracle we had finished the temple in time. I knew what he didn’t. It was entirely through the Lord’s hand that the temple was finished in time for the dedication.</p>
<p>Faith requires that we do all we can to bring about the things we hope and pray for. President Kimball said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In faith we plant the seed, and soon we see the miracle of the blossoming. Men have often misunderstood and have reversed the process. They would have the harvest before the planting, the reward before the service, the miracle before the faith…” <a href="#FN10">[10]</a></p>
<p>“President Kimball continued by explaining that many of us want to have health and strength without keeping the health laws. We want to have prosperity without paying our tithes. We want to be close to the Lord but don’t want to fast and pray. We want to have rain in due season and to have peace in the land without observing the Sabbath as a holy day and without keeping the other commandments of the Lord.” <a href="#FN11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I no longer directly manage the construction of temples as I did years ago, so my experiences have changed. Yet as the Director of International Construction for Temples and Special Projects, I still have the privilege of seeing the arm of the Lord being revealed as he directs his work through his faithful and humble servants. I marvel at how the Lord guides Church counsels through his Spirit to unitedly press forward and I still follow those 4 basic principles I mentioned previously as I engage in this exciting and inspired work. I began my employment with the Church in 1996 as a Project Manager for the St. Louis Missouri Temple, which became temple number 50 in 1997. In the last 19 years since then, 100 additional temples have been completed for a total of 150 dedicated and operating temples, with another 27 temples in various stages of design and construction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February of this year I had the privilege of attending the Suva Fiji Temple dedication and again witnessed the Lord’s hand.</p>
<p>We landed in Suva on Wednesday before the dedication. The island was sunny, warm and beautiful. Yet at that time, Category 4 Cyclone Winston was causing widespread devastation as it thrashed some of the islands of the South Pacific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, we were notified that Cyclone Winston had changed directions and was headed directly toward the islands of Fiji. I remember thinking to myself, “This could be devastating.” While serving my mission in Papeete, Tahiti in 1983, Cyclone Vaena hit the French Polynesian islands causing power outages, flooding, widespread destruction, and displacing thousands of people. I was a young missionary living in an abandoned school building by the temple construction site. For a few weeks, our purpose as missionaries was to assist with the cleanup and recovery efforts.</p>
<p>On Friday, Cyclone Winston became a Category 5 storm with wind speeds up to 175 mph. It was projected that the cyclone was headed directly to Suva and Nadi. The last large storm to hit the islands was 30 years ago. When President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency and the other General Authorities arrived in Suva to dedicate the temple, I felt much calmer. I trusted that the Lord would protect his faithful and humble servants.</p>
<p>On Saturday, we prepared for the storm. The winds were increasing and warnings were sent to all the island inhabitants. We purchased food and water before attending the Cultural Celebration. The celebration was wonderful. The youth were extraordinary. They performed magnificently while the storm raged outside the auditorium. When it became apparent conditions were getting much worse outside, Church leadership ended the program early to ensure that the youth and their families could find safe shelter. Those of us in the Special Projects Department who had flown to Suva, Fiji for the dedication made our way back to the hotel, where we ate dinner and settled in for the night. I watched the wind and rain increase dramatically while the storm surge wreaked havoc with the coast line. I felt a little concerned when the attending General Authorities left the hotel to take refuge at the temple. Our hotel briefly lost power, but generators supplied enough power to allow me to watch NetFlix before going to bed. I don’t remember what I watched, but I clearly remember the peace I felt as the storm raged and at the dedication the following day.</p>
<p>On Sunday, February 21, 2016, the day of the dedication, we passed downed power lines, trees and debris everywhere on our way to the temple. To our surprise, the temple grounds looked neat and unscathed. President Eyring presided over the temple dedication as planned, although many people were unable to attend due to the widespread devastation and suspension of transportation. Miraculously, the cyclone had abruptly changed its path and veered away. Suva was spared a direct hit. The Lord had intervened and allowed His holy house to be dedicated as scheduled, again allowing the temple to bless the lives of the members in that region.</p>
<p>All of these experiences reveal the arm of the Lord in this sacred work. I know that miracles are wrought by faith when we do all within our power to keep this great work progressing.</p>
<p>The construction phase of the temple is a relatively short and minor period of time when compared with the decades/centuries that a temple will be in operation fulfilling its divine purpose. The Lord guides all aspects of the work pertaining to His holy houses so that all of His children may have the opportunity to receive His promised blessings by making covenants and participating in the sacred saving ordinances that can only be performed in the temple, the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>At this phase of your life, you may be facing daunting challenges. The road ahead may seem impossible and never ending, but the Lord has promised, “I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.” <a href="#FN12">[12]</a> It does not matter what your circumstances, the way forward is the same. Follow the example of the brother of Jared: go to the Lord for help and guidance, then get on your feet and get to work.</p>
<p>We are here to learn by exercising our agency through life’s challenges as we rely upon the Lord. I testify that this is the Lord’s work. He loves each one of us and will help us succeed when we humbly seek and follow his counsel.</p>
<p>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>May 24, 2016<br />James D. Gordon<br />Assistant to the President for Planning and Assessment, BYU<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am honored to be with you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was mentioned that I’m an assistant to the president. I’m reminded of the story of a high school principal who telephoned the local university. He said, “I want a graduation speaker, and I want nothing lower than an assistant to the president.” The secretary said, “Sir, there is nothing lower than an assistant to the president."</p>
<p>When I was asked to speak today, they said, “Don’t try to be funny, don’t try to be witty, don’t try to be engaging. Just be yourself.”</p>
<p>The last time I gave a speech, a fight broke out. Apparently, somebody was blocking an exit.</p>
<p>I remember when I went to college. That was a long time ago. In those days, to get into college, we didn’t have admission tests or high school grades. Instead, to be admitted, we had to kill a saber-tooth tiger.</p>
<p>Science has changed a lot since I was a student. For example, when I studied astronomy, I learned that there were nine planets. That was before Pluto was downgraded to a tropical storm.</p>
<p>I tried to study math. It’s been reported that sixty percent of people cannot do basic math. Sixty percent! That’s nearly half! But we shouldn’t laugh, and most of you didn’t, and I appreciate that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to offer some advice as you pursue your education.</p>
<p>First, do your best in school. You might recall a story about a person who was asked to build a house. He decided to cut corners, use cheap materials, and do a poor job. When he was done, the owner handed him the key, and said, “I’d like to give you this house as a gift.”Attending the university is like that. You can work hard and do a good job. Or you can cut corners and do a poor job. Be fair with yourself by giving your best effort. I encourage you to work diligently, to learn a lot, and to prepare well for the future.</p>
<p>Second, do things to enrich your education, like working with a faculty member, doing an internship, or participating in student leadership or a student association. When you look back on your education here, these extra activities will have special meaning.</p>
<p>When I was a university student I participated in a musical trio. I wanted to pursue a career in music, but I was unfairly held back by a lack of talent. Our musical trio performed oldies songs. To me, they are oldies. To you, they are ancient. Somehow it was arranged for us to perform at the closing banquet for our residence halls. Surprisingly, the leaders agreed to this without giving us an audition to see how we performed. They probably never made that mistake again. The lead singer in our group had a very good voice. He was Professor Mark James, who is a faculty member here in the Department of English Language Teaching and Learning. I played the guitar, poorly. The third member of our trio played a kazoo while wearing a full-headed Wolfman mask. He was a sight to behold. Astonishingly, after we performed, the audience applauded. I think it was because of the beautiful voice of Professor Mark James—and the spectacle of Wolfman playing a kazoo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you are a student, you might participate in intramural sports. Personally, I’m not very athletic. I tell my students that I played football in high school. They had a play designed especially for me. It was called “Pencilneck Right.” You know how some teams use the run to set up the pass? Well, Pencilneck Right was used to set up the injury timeout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was in high school I was in the chess club. I tell my students that I had a rook on my letterman’s jacket. Do you know what it says when you walk around campus with a rook on your letterman’s jacket? “Don’t mess with me, pal.” “Checkmate!”</p>
<p>Third, give service. It’s important to fulfill Church callings and to perform other service. Service is important for its own sake, and it helps you to keep a broader perspective and to stay balanced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, make friends. Even though your classmates are not as good-looking — and not as humble — as you are, they are bright, good, and interesting people. The friendships you make here can last throughout your whole life, and can be a particularly sweet aspect of your university experience. Take time to make friends.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I didn’t have many friends. Once I told my dad that the other kids were giving me a hard time about my religion. My father sat down next to me, and, in his fatherly way, he said, “Son, it doesn’t matter what race you are or what religion you are. There will always be people who don’t like you. Because you’re irritating.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, enjoy your university education. It’s exciting, fascinating, challenging, and fun. The secret to happiness is not to look forward to some future time when all your problems will be solved. The secret is to be happy today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to talk about living a balanced life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was a child, my family spent some summers near the ocean in northern California. My father was a high school biology teacher, and during some summers he worked as a naturalist in California state parks in the redwood forests. We enjoyed living in the redwoods and going to the ocean as a family.</p>
<p>One of my favorite childhood memories is digging for agates, which are small translucent stones. It was like a treasure hunt. I would sit on the beach and dig a small hole in the gravel with a piece of driftwood. When I found an agate, I would hold it up to see if the sunlight shown through it. Finding an agate was fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an adult, I wanted to share this happy experience with my children. One summer we went to a beach which I had visited as a child. It is called Agate Beach because many agates can be found there. I began to dig in the gravel. However, not long after we began digging, one of my children got hit by an ocean wave. The ocean in northern California is cold, and my young daughter was wet and cold. However, I wanted to continue digging for agates, and I did. After a while Nadine told me that she was taking our daughter back to the car. I understood that it was time to leave the beach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agates were worth little. By contrast, my daughter was very important. But I was so focused on digging for agates that it was hard for me to pull away from it and to focus on what was most important. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our lives we have obligations in our family, in Church service, and in our education and career. Sometimes we tend to get them inverted. Education and career can seem to be the most important things. After we meet those priorities, then we give time to Church callings, and then we give time to our family. It’s easy to understand how this happens. Our education and career make demands. They impose responsibilities and deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our education is important. The Lord has invited us to seek learning. He said, “...[S]eek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.”<a href="#FN1">[1]</a> He commanded early Church leaders to “study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people.”<a href="#FN2">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="#FN2"></a>An education can help us to develop personally, prepare to provide for ourselves and our family, and increase our ability to serve others. President Brigham Young said, “Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family.”<a href="#FN3">[3]</a> President Thomas S. Monson taught, “Your talents will expand as you study and learn. You will be able to better assist your families in their learning, and you will have peace of mind in knowing that you have prepared yourself for the eventualities that you may encounter in life.”<a href="#FN4">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great privilege to study at Brigham Young University–Hawaii. You have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is consistent with the principles of the gospel. Being a student here is a position of trust. You have the responsibility to study hard, to obey the Honor Code, and to prepare for future service. Hopefully, throughout your life you will look back on your time here with fondness, and you will cherish the memories.</p>
<p>Our career is also important. We need to meet our professional responsibilities, and we give service to others through our career. Our career also produces income to support ourselves and our family. However, we need to be careful, because money and status can become false gods. They don’t bring happiness in this life or eternal life in the world to come. The gospel does.</p>
<p>Our education and career are important. However, they are not the only things that are important. The gospel teaches what our priorities should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior said, “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.”<a href="#FN5">[5]</a> The Savior also said, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”<a href="#FN6">[6]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Jacob taught: “Before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God. And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.”<a href="#FN7">[7]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>William Law, an eighteenth-century English clergyman, wrote, “If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead.”<a href="#FN8">[8]</a> President Ezra Taft Benson said, “We must put God in the forefront of everything else in our lives. . . . When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives.”<a href="#FN9">[9]</a></p>
<p><a href="#FN9"></a>Church members have the opportunity to give service through Church callings and in other ways. This service blesses others and helps us to develop Christlike qualities. We should serve faithfully and diligently. Sometimes we may wonder whether we are doing enough to magnify our Church callings. We need to pray about how best to perform our callings while also meeting our family’s needs and our other obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our families are a priority. Each member of our family is a child of God who needs our love, care, and attention.&nbsp;So how can we keep our priorities straight?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts.</p>
<p>First, we need to read the scriptures regularly, so that they become part of our lives. Reading the scriptures reminds us of the Lord’s commandments, the covenants that we have made to keep them, and the blessings of the gospel. Studying the scriptures also invites the Holy Ghost, which will guide our decisions and help us to focus on what is most important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, we should heed the Proclamation on the Family. It says, “Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. ‘Children are an heritage of the Lord’ (Psalm 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.”<a href="#FN10">[10]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proclamation on the Family also says, “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.”<a href="#FN11">[11]</a> These sentences are filled with truth and wisdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, we should give service to others. Service helps us to forget about ourselves and to think more about others. I remember one occasion when I participated in a service project to help a family in our ward. After the service project, I walked home in the dark. As I walked, I thought, “I have no problems.” Of course I had problems, but seeing some of the challenges that this family faced helped me to put my problems in perspective. When we serve others, we focus less on ourselves and experience more joy. The Savior said, “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.”<a href="#FN12">[12]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, we should avoid unnecessary debt. A reasonable amount of debt can be appropriate for such purposes as obtaining an education or buying a house. However, excessive debt can put your life out of balance. President Heber J. Grant said, “If there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into the family, it is to live within our means, and if there is any one thing that is grinding, and discouraging and disheartening it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet.”<a href="#FN13">[13]</a></p>
<p><a href="#FN13"></a>To avoid unnecessary debt, it is important not to confuse wants and needs. Elder Joe J. Christensen said that we should remember the line, “There, there, little luxury, don’t you cry. You’ll be a necessity by and by.”<a href="#FN14">[14]</a>&nbsp;A person without excessive debt has more freedom to spend time and resources on things that matter most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we create time for our family and Church service?&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we need to pray for guidance. Heavenly Father answers our prayers and will help us to meet our challenges. The promptings of the Holy Ghost will guide us in making wise decisions.</p>
<p>Second, we should plan, set goals, and organize our time. Planning together in family councils can help. It has been observed: you don’t find time; you make time. Also, if we examine our lives, we may discover that we could use some of our time more productively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, we need to have family prayer and scripture study, family home evening, and wholesome recreational activities.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should seek opportunities to be with family members: reading; talking; going on errands together; and working together. Our relationships with family members will improve as we spend time with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, we need to make choices. Our education or our career can take all of our time if we let it. We have to choose what is important and what we should accomplish. One time at work I felt overwhelmed. There were too many things that I thought I needed to accomplish, and I was frustrated. I told Nadine about the situation. She responded, in essence, “You can’t do it all. You have to choose what you’re going to do.” We need to make choices. Sometimes this means that we need to simplify our lives.</p>
<p>Sixth, we should work hard. I was impressed by a story about Emeritus General Authority Seventy F. Enzio Busche. Before he was called to be a General Authority, he was the head of a printing business in Germany. At one point he learned that his largest customer had decided to do its own printing. That customer accounted for about seventy percent of his printing company’s sales. He wrote: “I was completely paralyzed for a while because I knew this could seal the doom of our company, which my mother and most of my sisters depended on for their living. I was also busier than at any time with Church work. I became more and more paralyzed with panic, fear, and despair.</p>
<p>“One night at about 3:00 A.M., I could not sleep yet again. I turned over in my mind the wildest propositions for this company, but to no avail. Finally, I decided to go out for a while. I got dressed quietly so as not to waken my wife. I went out in the streets. There was a light drizzle and a little fog in the air. The cold asphalt and concrete of the city increased the awareness of my hopeless situation.</p>
<p>“In despair, I threw myself on the ground, crying and calling on my Heavenly Father. Suddenly something happened. I heard a voice very close to my right ear speak one single word: [work]."<a href="#FN15">[15]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although he was already working hard, he decided to work even harder. He committed that for the next six months he would get up thirty minutes earlier. He also decided to use his time better. He received new insights regarding his business. His company survived. Hard work is a key to success. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father will help us to give appropriate attention to our family, Church service, and education and career. He wants us to succeed, and He will open the way. We need to have faith and trust in Him. Nephi said, “If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them.”<a href="#FN16">[16]</a></p>
<p><a href="#FN16"></a>Many years ago, President John Tanner attended graduate school and I attended law school at the same university at the same time. President and Sister Tanner welcomed Nadine and me to the ward when we moved in. They used to invite new students to their residence to help them feel welcome. We became dear friends with President and Sister Tanner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Tanner and I worked on cars together, trying to repair them. We would say, “We’re graduate students. How hard can it be?” We learned that it could be very hard. The humorist Will Rogers once said, “You know everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects.” I proved it. We faced uncertainty about the future. We didn’t know what lay ahead. But we had faith that things would work out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One evening I had a temple recommend interview with the stake president. He asked me whether I was fulfilling my calling. I was a stake missionary. It was a wonderful calling, but I didn’t think that I was spending enough time on it. I was going to school full-time and working part-time. I had a wife and a baby daughter. I expressed my concerns to my stake president.</p>
<p>He was understanding and wise. He explained that by going to school I was preparing myself for future service. He did not say that I was excused from my Church calling, or that it was okay to do it poorly. However, he helped me to have a larger perspective. Church service was an important priority, but so also was going to school. I stopped worrying so much and continued in my Church calling and my schooling. I found a balance. I had wonderful experiences teaching the gospel and seeing people come into the waters of baptism. These experiences were great blessings which I treasure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work that you do in your family, the Church, and your education and career is not easy. It is hard work, and it can be challenging. At times you may get tired or discouraged. Sometimes we get so focused on the details that it’s helpful to be reminded of the larger vision.</p>
<p>I had an experience that relates to this idea. During the summer after my first year of law school, President Tanner and I obtained jobs as groundskeepers, or gardeners, at the Oakland California Temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Oakland Temple sits on a hill overlooking the San Francisco Bay. The grounds are beautiful. They include palm trees, bushes, grass, and colorful flowers. On the roof there are additional gardens, and one can climb the stairs and enjoy them. From the roof there is a spectacular view of the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>Gardening was hard work. We planted flowers and pulled weeds. We watered plants and swept sidewalks. We dug holes in the ground. I remember President Tanner standing in a hole in the ground and quoting lines from Shakespeare. We wore hats to protect ourselves from the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The job involved hard work, and it was tiring. But it had a larger purpose. The temple grounds are the grounds of the House of the Lord. We helped the temple grounds to be beautiful. Temple workers, patrons, and other visitors enjoyed the peace and beauty of the temple grounds. This was a blessing to them. We tended the Lord’s garden. It was a privilege.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the work that we do in our families, in the Church, and in our education and career has important, even eternal, purposes. It is part of the plan that Heavenly Father has for our growth and service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to pace ourselves. King Benjamin counseled, “And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.”<a href="#FN17">[17]</a>&nbsp;We can’t do everything at once, but with the Lord’s help, we can succeed far beyond our natural abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a wonderful time to be on earth. There are so many opportunities for education, growth, and service. Some people say that we should live each day if it were our last day on earth. It’s true that we should cherish each day and use it well. However, if you knew that today were really your last day on earth, you might not attend your classes today. You might not prepare for the future. Instead, I like President Gordon B. Hinckley’s advice: “Live each day as if you were going to live eternally, for you surely shall.”<a href="#FN18">[18]</a> President Monson said, “Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith.”<a href="#FN19">[19]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray for heaven’s blessings on you as you serve and work in your families, in the Church, and in your education and career. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>May 17, 2016<br />Daryl Whitford<br />University Registrar, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>About 2 ½ years ago my Bishop at the time, Kevin Schlag, called me in to his office to let me know that I was going to be released from my calling as the Ward Relief Society president. Feeling that this would give me more time on my hands I prayed for guidance and to know what I should do with my life now. We were empty nesters and I needed to keep myself busy. I had had thoughts of pursuing a higher education. (Yes at my late age I could still go on for more). Well my answer came a few weeks later, but it was not what I expected. Brother Keith Lane, a stake high councilman, wanted to talk to me and called me to be our ward seminary teacher. I have had two dreads in my life and this was one of them. My other dread was speaking in Devotional and as you can see I couldn’t get out of that either. I had no problem being called to any other position in the ward but this was the one calling that I did not want. I wanted so badly to say no but the words that came out of my mouth were ‘yes I will do it’. All I could think about was how am I going to do this calling. My husband, who is a wonderful gospel teacher, wouldn’t be able to help me because he worked at Kaimuki High school and he left each morning at 5:00am. In my own understanding, I would be left to do this on my own. At least I didn’t have to start until after the Christmas break so I had a little time to prepare.</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott said, “This life is an experience in profound trust – trust in Jesus Christ, trust in his teachings, trust in our capacity as led by the Holy Spirit to obey those teachings for happiness now and for a purposeful, supremely happy eternal existence. To trust means to obey willingly without knowing the end from the beginning. To produce fruit, your trust in the Lord must be more powerful and enduring than your confidence in your own personal feelings and experience.”<a href="#FN1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I look back now on this calling and I can see now what a blessing it has been in my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has truly helped me to see the way I should teach my students, all 21 of them. My fellow seminary teachers who are here today know what I am saying. My prayers were answered, but not in the way that I understood it would. This experience has helped me to develop my trust and faith in the Lord. I know that after I read through the scripture passage for the day, I can ponder and think about what I have to teach and then pray to Heavenly Father for direction on how and what he wants me to teach so that my class will understand the principles that are going to be taught that day the way the Lord wants it to be done. I have woken up many nights with a clear vision on how I should present the lesson. That really helps when you only have a day to ponder and prepare. I even got help in choosing what type of scripture mastery activity we could do. As I turned to the Lord and exercised my faith in Him, I began to let Him help and guide me.</p>
<p>Proverbs 3:5-6 reads, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, our course of study has been the Old Testament. I have received an increased understanding of the temple endowment and other ordinances performed in the temple as we have studied the Old testament books. I have truly been blessed and had I leaned on my own understanding and not trusted in the Lord I would not have had this wonderful experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2 Kings Chapter 5 we read of Naaman who was a mighty man but he was a leper. He tried many ways to be healed of his sickness, but nothing worked. A young Israelite maid, who waited on his wife, told her mistress that there was a prophet who she knew could heal him. Naaman went to visit the prophet Elisha and fully expected Elisha to come out waving his hand and healing him of his infirmity but he didn’t. In fact, Elisha did not come at all but he sent his messenger to tell him that all he had to do was "wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean."<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;Naaman’s reply was, “Are not the Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them and be clean?...”<sup><a href="#FN4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;As I read this, I thought of the dirty lagoon water at the Polynesian Cultural Center and wonder how many of us would wash in that water seven times. In my younger years of dancing, I remember being in that water and once was enough for me. But here is Naaman having to do it seven times. How could washing in dirty water make him clean? In our understanding that does not seem possible. Naaman was ready to walk away from it all however, his servant, who probably had more faith in God than he, reminded him that “if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?”<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;As we know he then goes and washes in the Jordan and after the seventh time his flesh was clean. Lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p>Elder Scott tells us that “To exercise faith is to trust that the Lord knows what he is doing with you and that he can accomplish it for your eternal good even though you cannot understand how He can possibly do it. We are like infants in our understanding of eternal matters and their impact on us here in mortality. Yet at times, we act as if we know it all. When you pass through trials for His purposes, as you trust Him, exercise faith in Him, He will help you.”<sup><a href="#FN6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father knows us and loves us. He will not forget us. Some years ago my husband was the Athletic director at Kahuku High school and was put on paid leave due to an ineligible player on the Football team and so while they were investigating he had to stay off work. My children and I were very upset that he had to be the one to be punished and so we were very verbal to my husband telling him what he should do to get back at the school but in all this my husband continued to have faith in the Lord and told us that the Lord would take care. Our understanding was that we needed to do something to get Dad back to his job. During this time of being off the job, the Lord blessed my husband. The temple was reopening, after the extensive renovation and he was able to work as a temple worker and learn from Bro Ben Nihipali the correct way of running a shift, setting up for large sessions and just making it comfortable for the patrons who would come. He would not have been able to do this if he had still been working as AD because it is a very time consuming job.</p>
<p>For almost 1 ½ years that he was on leave, my husband was able to enjoy being in the temple and serving others. He did not waiver in his faith and knew the Lord would help him through this trial. He would always say the Lord will provide. We decided that he should just quit his job, since they were taking so long and not doing anything. My husband still wanted to work in the temple and we felt that if he went back to his AD job then he would have to give up being a temple worker. Besides he was getting older. So he put in his papers to return to teach with the DOE. We had decided that he should start subbing while we waited for a position to open up for him. To do this, he was going to go to the West side because they always have subbing jobs over there and this would help us maintain a steady income. His parents lived down that side so he was going to stay there during the week and return home on Fridays. In our understanding, he was going so he could continue to support our family. But while he was there, he was able to spend more time with his mother whom he had had a strained relationship with and also bond with a brother who had been adopted out to his father’s friend. This brother had come over to get some genealogy from his mother and continued to come over while my husband was there so they could bond as brothers do. They were able to have long gospel discussions as he wasn’t a member, although his wife was. My husband was able to baptize his brother’s son and we continued to work on him and be an example to him. As we looked back on this time we knew that although we had our plan, the Lord had something else in mind. We were so grateful to the Lord for giving my husband this time with his family because his mother passed away later that year and it made this time even more precious. Lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p>When my husband started getting sick, he would never question the Lord as to why he could not get better and why this had to happen to him. He would never complain about his pain or discomfort but always tell me how grateful he was for his many blessings. One of those blessings was the opportunity to teach a few classes here at BYUH. I would be the one to complain and perhaps murmur. I petitioned to the Lord that if I served others more and if I did all that He asked of me and more, would He bless my husband and make him well again. I tried all that I could, working for others in the temple, serving those around me and always trying to help those in need. I even changed the attitude I had as I took care of my husband. I no longer looked at it as a burden or sacrifice but as though I was serving the Lord. The Lord did bless my husband but not in the way that I imagined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord decided it was time to take him to the other side. I know now that the Lord did hear my pleads and did answer my prayers but not in the way that I understood. In this trial I know that the Lord was with us. My faith and trust in the Lord had helped to strengthen me and I gained a stronger testimony of the Atonement in my life. It took on a new meaning to me as I had this experience. By trusting in the Lord I came to know that through the Atonement I could find peace and comfort. I know that the Lord will continue to bless me as I do what he wants me to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Hel 5:12 it reads, “And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fail.”<sup><a href="#FN7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By having faith and trusting in the Lord daily we can be prepared for those times when big trials come. We can prepare and know that because of our experience that the Lord will be there for us. He knows our needs. He will not leave us alone. We just need to call on him, in faith and he will answer our prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us, for some reason, have come to BYUH. We are not here by chance but there is a reason. Before graduation, I usually send out an email to the prospective graduates inviting them to share something unique about themselves. Usually the Commencement speakers want to know the graduates and perhaps what has brought them here to BYUH. Usually I get answers like, I have siblings who graduated from this school or I have this many kids and I am graduating, or my husband and I are graduating together. Occasionally I will get a reply that is so uplifting and so touching that it brings me to tears. One student told me that although his family were not members, his father had suggested that he come to BYUH. He had been online and came across our website and was impressed by what we offered. In his understanding he was coming to go to school and get an education but he said this experience here changed his life. Unlike many of you who have found your spouse here, he left single, but he left as a member of the church. He shared how the faculty and students and friends that he met here had helped him have an experience that he could not have had elsewhere. He left not only with a degree but with a testimony of the gospel and for that he was grateful. He knows that because he showed faith and came to BYUH that he was blessed.</p>
<p>When he came to the office one day, just after this, I recognized his name and talked to him more about his experience. He told me he still didn’t quite understand how or what made his father go online to check out schools, but it was a blessing in his life. Many of us do not understand why we have come here but if we trust in the Lord, keep his commandments and be obedient, the Lord will be able to guide us and direct us to do what he wants us to do.</p>
<p>I have been on a few road trips these past few months, visiting with my children in the mainland and visiting places that we were not too sure of. Something common in each of these trips has been the use of a little black box. The GPS. Some of you use your phones, we use the GPS, but in each case you put in your current location, then your desired address and off you go. A lot has changed since the old days when we used to use a road map. For those of you who are too young to know what a road map is….it is a piece of paper with all the highways, freeways, byways, streets and avenues listed on it. As a traveler, you would work out your route or root as you say in America, drawing lines all over this map deciding the best way to travel. A prayer for guidance and safety in your travels, and a plea that you would get to your destination would be offered and then you would go for it. Using the map you would sometimes miss the exit or take a wrong turn. An argument between driver and navigator would usually take place and then you are back on the road again. With the GPS, addresses are simply put in the device and off you go, with a little voice reminding you to …’in .2 miles take the exit on the right and stay left.” The GPS would get you to your destination. Sometimes, it will try to take you on a side route which means you go through toll roads where you need to pay to use the roads. (Those of you from California know what I am talking about). It may help you to get through with the least amount of traffic and will get you where you want to go with this toll that you have to pay. Sometimes you turn off your GPS because towards the end, you see your destination in the distance and say ‘I got it. We’re good.’ But no, perhaps you turn one street too soon and have to go back. You thought you have it but really you don’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I relate this experience to you because I was beginning to realize that we easily put all our trust in this GPS or these devices and we forget to trust in the Lord. We faithfully follow the GPS path, but we are not so fast in following the path that our Heavenly Father has prepared for us. When we have to pay the toll or go through trials, we hesitate and question why this or that but how many of us are willing and eager to follow the path he has given us. I know, that as we follow the path and go through these trials our Heavenly Father will be there to help us and guide us through. Let him be our GPS and allow the still small voice of the spirit guide us on our way. Lean not unto thine own understanding and He will direct our path. Always consult Him in all things and don’t turn Him off.</p>
<p>When Joshua led the Israelites to attack Jericho, the Lord gave him specific instructions. They were told to circle the city, once each day for six days but be quiet, don’t make any noise until Joshua told them to. On the seventh day, after walking around the city seven times and after the priests had blown their horns, the people were allowed to shout: for the Lord hath given them the city. The Israelites followed the Lord’s command with exactness and were able to take the city of Jericho. I wonder how many of us would question how it would have been possible to take the city by only doing these things. Perhaps the people did not understand the reason why the Lord wanted them to do this but they were willing to follow exactly what the Lord asked and they were able to witness the walls of Jericho fall. If only we could have this faith.</p>
<p>President James E. Faust tells a wonderful story in his message, The Shield of Faith, from the Liahona magazine July 2000. He tells of a heroic pioneer woman from Haun’s Mill, Amanda Smith and how she was able to do something beyond her abilities and the scientific knowledge of her time. It was in 1838 after the terrible attack on the mill, when she found her eldest son carrying her youngest son Alma and she believed that he was dead. He was not dead but had had his entire hipbone shot away. When she examined the wound she said it was a ghastly sight and she had no idea what to do so she prayed to Heavenly Father asking what she should do. These are her words ‘Oh my Heavenly Father; what shall I do? Thou seest my poor wounded boy and knowest my inexperience. Oh, Heavenly Father, direct me what to do! She said that she was directed by a voice telling her what to do. She was instructed to use the ashes of their smoldering fire and make a lye and put the cloth saturates with it right into the wound. She continued to saturate the cloth and put it into the hole and each time mashed flesh and splinters of bone came away with the cloth and the wound became as white as Chicken’s flesh. She then prayed again for direction and as she did she was instructed, as though a physician had been standing by her. This time she was told to make a poultice from a nearby slippery-elm tree and fill the wound with it. She dressed the wound as directed and added balsam to help soothe the pain. She asked her son if he believed that the Lord could make him a new hip. He asked her if she believed and she said yes because the Lord had shown her in a vision. So her son laid on his bed, flat on his face for five weeks until he was entirely healed, a flexible gristle having grown in place of the missing joint and socket. He was able to continue in his life and was never crippled, all because of the faith of his mother.<sup><a href="#FN8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Charles W. Penrose said, “Some people will not believe anything they cannot grasp with their human reason or cannot see with their natural eyes. But blessed is the man of faith, blessed is the woman of faith! For by faith they can see into things that cannot be discerned by the natural eyes. They can reach out to the regions of immortality, grasp eternal realities and lay hold upon things of God.”<a href="#FN9">9</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we trust in God and lean not unto our own understanding. But exercise our faith and allow the Lord&nbsp;</p>
<p>to direct our path. In the name of Jesus Christ Amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How did you get here? I arrived in a plane, with my family.&nbsp;It took us many hours to get here; in another time it would have taken many months or even years.&nbsp;You also may have arrived by plane, or by boat, or by car—if your home is on Oahu.&nbsp;In every case you left someplace in order to get someplace, and the getting required some doing:&nbsp;planning, walking, paying, sacrificing, overcoming obstacles that only you know about.&nbsp;See if you can identify the leaving, the overcoming, and the arriving, in this rather strange story, written by Lewis Carroll in the late nineteenth century.&nbsp;A father calls his son and counsels him in preparation for a journey:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He took his vorpal sword in hand;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long time the manxome foe he sought—</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So rested he by the Tumtum tree</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood awhile in thought.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And, as in uffish thought he stood,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And burbled as it came!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One, two! One, two! And through and through</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He left it dead, and with its head</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went galumphing back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He chortled in his joy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you only understood half the words, don’t panic. The author made up many of them:&nbsp;you won’t find “frabjous” or “frumious” in the typical dictionary.&nbsp;But, you probably recognized the main characters: a father, his son, and the terrible Jabberwock that has claws, fearful teeth and a rotten disposition. The son is about to undertake a major journey and the father gives him advice:&nbsp;beware—where you are going there are many dangers! The son departs, wisely arms himself with a “vorpal sword” and for a “long time” seeks out the Jabberwock.&nbsp;In his seeking he makes time to rest and to reflect, “so rested he by the Tumtum tree /and stood awhile in thought.”&nbsp;Why he chose the Tumtum tree as a place of meditation isn’t clear, but we are familiar with mythic trees and groves—places of knowledge and of revelation (the Trees of Life and Knowledge, the Sacred Grove).&nbsp;In this particular place, rested and “in uffish thought,” the wisened boy finally confronts the Jabberwock and with a “snicker-snack” deprives the beast of its head.&nbsp;He has overcome.&nbsp;He returns to his “chortling” and joyous father.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know this pattern well; it is everywhere:&nbsp;Homer’s Odysseus leaves home, wins a war, and overcomes intimidating obstacles before he returns home; perhaps more familiar, Dorothy arrives in the Land of the Munchkins, strikes out with her friends to the Emerald City, each in search of a personal goal (compassion, wisdom, courage, home).&nbsp;This pattern is the pattern of the scriptures.&nbsp;Let’s start with the big one:&nbsp;Exodus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph is his father’s favorite—fathers should not have favorites—and the jealous brothers put in motion a series of events that leads Joseph away from home and toward Egypt.&nbsp;He overcomes a number of obstacles (pit, prison, Potiphar’s wife) and his misfortune turns to his family’s fortune; after a number of generations, the people once considered privileged guests become slaves.&nbsp;Enter Moses and the indecisive pharaoh.&nbsp;Moses and his people wander in a barren wilderness for a very long time.&nbsp;They murmur and get a pillar of fire to guide their travels.&nbsp;They murmur again and receive sacred words written miraculously on stone tablets.&nbsp;They murmur some more and get manna. They get tired of eating manna every…single…day and wish they were back in Egypt.&nbsp;Even Aaron and Moses have bad days. Eventually, they arrive at the land that God promised them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we didn’t have the Old Testament, we would still know about the Exodus because it was a story that was important to Nephi. He tells his weak-kneed brothers, “let us be strong like unto Moses”<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a>, and in case they had forgotten about Moses’s journey, he retells the entire tale: the children of Israel escaped Egypt because God loved them and sent them a prophet; this same prophet performed saving miracles at the Red Sea and at the rock that became a river of living water; nevertheless these blessed people reviled God who in his mercy still “did lead them,” and “after they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them mighty”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Nephi, Moses’s story was not ancient history, it was a story he and his family were living personally and daily, one that was easy to “liken” to their experience. “We did take… our journey in the wilderness”<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a>. They left home (including all the comforts that make home home). They wandered in a wilderness, including a stretch through the worst desert in the world. They murmured and got plates. They murmured some more and got married. Like Aaron and Moses, even Sariah and Lehi had bad days. The bow broke leading the big brothers to wish (again) the family had never abandoned their former life. More murmuring, and then the Liahona appeared with its sacred and corrective writings. “I am going to build a boat,” said obedient Nephi. “You must think you are a rocket scientist,” shot back his brothers—for so this boat-building must have seemed to them—a technologically unachievable project. The impossible boat, a new ark, carried the family to a promised land where they got to start over—a culture baptized and washed of its sins. They arrived at a land that God had promised them. Little wonder that at the end of all this troubled journeying Nephi quoted Isaiah: “Can a woman forget her sucking child…? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee…Behold, I have graven thee on the palms of my hands”<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a>.&nbsp; Like the boy’s father in Lewis Carroll’s “Jabberwocky,” our Father wants us back and He never abandons us, even in the midst of our existential waffling.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1846 thousands of saints left their homes and their gardens and their memories in Nauvoo the Beautiful and headed into the mud. It would have been easier to stay behind (and some chose to do just that), but they dreamed of “the place which God for us prepared, /far way, in the West.” It was not any place, but the place, the right place, and this place was prepared for them. It was also far away; this wasn’t going to be easy (but it was going to be worth it). Some murmured. All suffered. Some quit. Some participated in miracles. A few died (“Happy day!&nbsp; All is well”). Eventually, they arrived at the land that God had promised them. Though “hard to you this journey may appear, /Grace shall be as your day.” That last phrase is key: “Grace shall be as your day.” My wife’s and my several greats grandmother, Karen Marie, crossed an ocean (like Nephi), then crossed a desert (like Nephi) and buried four of her children along the way, pulling a handcart to Zion. Her daughter remembered,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember my mother was always very sad. Her face was stern and determined. She often explained to us girls that we would soon be safe in the great city of the Rocky Mountains. Little did she or we realize the terrible hardships we would face on that journey. I walked all the way from the Missouri River to the Salt Lake Valley. Nights when we made camp, my feet were often bleeding and sore, but through the kind and loving care of my mother, I was ready to march the next day. Her unfaltering faith, courage, determination and her tremendous capacity for work made possible that long and hazardous journey.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grace shall be as your day.” Grace is as dependable as the daily sunrise, even though we sometimes take it for granted. “Our God will never us forsake.” Grace is designed for murmurers and the imperfect, that is, for all of us. “I have graven thee on the palms of my hands.” No wonder “All is well.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These journeys are a type and a shadow of an eternal one known as the Eternal Plan of Happiness. We left our Heavenly Home with instructions, we journey during a specified period of time we call mortality and during which we confront our Jabberwocks, and then we return home. That being true, your college years are the mortality of your mortality: you have left home, journeyed to a strange (but beautiful!) place where you are tested and tried and where you will form habits and make decisions that will affect the rest of your life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we must ask ourselves, what kind of travelers will we be? “It had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness,” said the reluctant Israelites<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a>. “These many years we have suffered in the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy,” complained Laman and Lemuel<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a>. “I’ve already left homes in New York, Ohio, and Missouri,” said a non-pioneer, “and I am not leaving my apple trees in Nauvoo.” The thing is, I get the nostalgic Israelites, the always annoyed Laman and Lemuel, and the exhausted Latter-day Saint: what the Lord asked was really hard. What they didn’t realize was that the hard journey was easier than staying put. The Israelites could have remained enslaved; Laman and Lemuel could have been carried away captive to Babylon like their neighbors who stayed behind. The resident of Nauvoo could have escaped the Mississippi mosquitos and helped the desert blossom as a rose. In the end the journey forward is always more rewarding than looking back—just ask Lot’s wife. What do wise travelers do? They don’t avoid hard things. They rest. They are patient. They hang on. Let’s look at each of these more carefully.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They don’t avoid hard things</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cervantes’ Don Quixote described the sacrifices required for success in school: “To become distinguished in letters costs time, sleepless nights, hunger, nakedness, headaches, bouts of indigestion, and other things of this sort.” Can you relate? If you have to stay up all night studying, or rewrite your paper four times, or stay on your knees until your back aches, that’s not bad—it’s journeying. “We are a chosen generation, held back for this day.&nbsp; We are special and talented. Therefore, this thing called mortality should be a cinch for souls like ours.” This is what I call the entitlement of easiness. The entitlement of easiness is a perversion of the idea of innate or God-given talents. It proposes that those who possess certain gifts develop and display them with unlabored ease. Conversely, the entitlement of easiness leads us to conclude that if something is hard we must not be good at it. As a consequence, we veer from challenge to challenge in search of unearned excellence. The entitlement of easiness promotes a revised translation of 2 Nephi 2: 25: “men are that they might have fun.” A couple of decades ago one of my colleagues reminded us at graduation that “what is easy is never satisfying very long.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourteenth-century Italian poet Dante Alighieri describes a pilgrim’s epic journey—through hell, up the mountain of Purgatory, and into Paradise. At a particularly treacherous point Dante lets us look in on the pilgrim who climbs from one boulder to the next, until “the breath was so spent from my lungs…that I could go no farther.” Vergil, the pilgrim’s poet guide, shows little sympathy for his companion’s fatigue: “‘Now must thou thus cast off all sloth,’ said the Master, ‘for sitting…down…none comes to fame…Rise, therefore, conquer thy panting with the soul, which conquers in every battle if it sink not with its body’s weight. There is a longer stair which must be climbed.’”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entitlement of easiness relies on new metaphors of knowledge. We are tempted to think of learning in terms of turning on, turning up, logging on, and downloading. The intensified form of searching called research seems old school in the face the new&nbsp;verb “Google.” The illusion of instant erudition that reinforces the entitlement of easiness worries me. Agricultural metaphors for learning were more honest -- remember the mustard seed, and Alma's seed of faith. Ground was prepared, seed knowledgably sowed, vulnerable shoots nurtured, irrelevant and distracting weeds removed, all in preparation for the harvest. In agricultural metaphors, sequence is unalterable and imposes discipline. And patience: the agricultural cycle cannot be accelerated—a full season is required for the harvest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Hinckley was fond of quoting one of his “favorite newspaper columnists,” Jenkin Lloyd Jones:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed…. Life is just like an old time rail journey... delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vergil was right: there is a longer stair that must be climbed, and as the pilgrim learned, it leads to opportunities, lessons and graces that only our Creator fully understands. In accepting His invitation to climb, we renounce the false promises of the entitlement of easiness—promises that were never part of the covenant made with Adam and Eve or with their descendants. Adam and Eve started their journey by learning that learning itself would be purchased by the sweat of their brow. The Savior ended his journey with an entirely different kind of sweat—unimaginable, painful, infinite. It wasn’t easy, but it was necessary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They Rest</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the story from Dante doesn’t tell us is that from time to time the pilgrim needed to rest. In Lewis Carroll’s poem the boy interrupts his seeking in order to rest (by the Tumtum tree) and to reflect (in uffish thought). God modeled constructive leisure by resting after creating, and commanding us to do the same. The Savior prepared for his public ministry by spending forty days by himself. Enos got away from it all so that “the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life…sunk deep into my heart”<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a>. Nephi “sat pondering” and received a revelation<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a>. Joseph F. Smith “sat…pondering” and received the revelation we recognize today as the 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road we travel on our journey has many rest stops. Some of those exits are dangerous and if we linger we risk losing our way. Some of the rest stops are neutral; they simply let us unwind. A dinner and a movie, pizza on the beach, or going to a dance may not get us closer to the Celestial Kingdom, but they might help us recover a bit of physical and emotional resilience that will allow us to do a hard thing tomorrow. Some rest stops are also gas stations, places where we refuel. You can’t get gas without stopping; likewise, intellectual and spiritual refueling requires that we stop doing for a bit in order to take account of what we have been up to. Resting and refueling are part of journeying. “And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might rest ourselves and obtain food for our families”<a href="#_edn9">[9]</a>. “For the space of a time”—a strange phrase with an important message: rest is part of the journey when it is measured rest. Too much rest and we put down roots in unproductive places; too little rest and we never put down roots. Creativity, resilience and revelation are stems that sprout from rested roots. “I sat pondering…”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are Patient</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the afflictions of time-bound mortality is nowism. We want it, whatever it is, now, please. Later is too late. I want relief of my suffering…now. I want to get married…now. I want to understand math…now! The now, now, now of nowism led C.S. Lewis to speculate that we don’t really want a Father in Heaven, we want a Grandfather in Heaven, benign and generous and eager to spoil us. God, however, taught us an important lesson through what I call the syntax of creation, the orderly sequence in which things unfold as the Creators plan, counsel, and watch together. The sequence is necessary and unalterable. The narrative tells us that at each stage the Gods declared that what had happened on that day was “good”: they do this eight times in the Book of Moses<a href="#_edn10">[10]</a>. We grow day-by-day, line upon line, experience by experience. Sometimes we struggle because we want Day Six privileges and capabilities on Day One. God could not put animals on the land until they had something to eat; he could not cultivate vegetation until there was dry land; dry land was not possible until it was separated from the seas; and the sea first had to be divided from the firmament. And of course, first, there had to be light. What I find reassuring is what God did not do. At the end of Day Five he did not say, “after all this work and all this time, all I have to show for my effort is fish.” What He did say was that “all things which I had created” up to that time “were good”<a href="#_edn11">[11]</a>. So it is with us. We are sinful and imperfect, true, but that simply means we are “under construction.” If our hearts are right, at the end of each day we can know that God looks at our efforts and declares them to be good.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hang On!</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lehi journeyed so much that he even dreamed about journeying. One of his dreams is especially familiar. His children travel in a mist of darkness. It is dangerous and it is unavoidable. The mist envelopes everyone. One misstep and you might find yourself swimming in a polluted river. There is a tree way down yonder, maybe a Tumtree tree, or a Tree of Life, but the mist is so thick you can’t quite make it out; you have to trust your father that it is there. He motions to you to stretch out your right hand and grab on to something—what is it, smooth and straight? An iron rod! “Hang on,” your father yells. You have two choices: to hang or not to hang. If you choose not to hang you begin to wander into a mist that levels everything, where everything looks the same, good, evil, lovely and wretched, and pretty soon you stop believing that there is a wondrous tree down the way, and you forget all about the iron rod.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago my wife and I took some friends to Zion National Park in southern Utah. We decided to hike to Angel’s Landing up a narrow and winding trail that led to a small mesa high above the canyon floor—really high. At one point the trail is so narrow and drops off so abruptly (and so far!) on both sides that the park rangers have provided a railing made of linked chains affixed to the rock. We inched our way forward, hanging on for dear life, knowing that one misstep on the slippery sandstone would lead to disaster. I moved ahead, never letting go for a second, hand over hand, heart pounding. Don’t look down. Don’t look down! So I looked ahead, and there was my dear wife in the scariest, deadliest section of all—letting go! I yelled, Lehi-like, “hang on, my dear, or our children will be motherless!” She looked at me like I had lost my mind, confident that she was in complete control of the situation. Now, I must clarify, that when it comes to Lehi’s iron rod, my wife is the most assiduous hanger-on-er of anyone I know, but in this one instance I felt like Lehi fearing for the salvation of his loved ones, knowing that safety was in hanging on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you choose to hang on. That is not always easy. On the hill over there your friends call to you from a really nice house—pool, Jacuzzi, great and spacious in everyway. “Now there’s a rest stop I can get into,” you think. Just a short detour won’t hurt. It’s not that you can’t get back to the iron rod after a weekend in Hotel Great and Spacious, but it is really hard—a lot harder than just hanging on in the first place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes your friends call out from the mist. “Its great out here,” they cry. “There are no roads at all. No rules. Everyone can go in whatever direction they want. No one judges you! Best of all, out here in the mist there are no consequences.” The no consequences part gets you to relax your grip a bit, because that sounds really enticing. But you hang on and head down the path a little more, and pretty soon you begin to see the distant glow of the tree, just like Dad said, and you understand that the promise of no consequences was a lie. Everything is consequential.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the mist gets so thick, and the wind blows so hard, that you can’t see the tree’s glow or hear your father’s voice. Now, you think, there is no visible evidence that there is a tree and you haven’t seen your father for so long that you are not sure he cares, or even that he exists. You decide that the iron rod was made in China, and that path you have been on is so strait and so narrow—it seems kind of exclusive. All of a sudden your doubt seems noble, even virtuous, and you head off into the mist thinking you are oh-so-open-minded. Hang on! Hang on, because if you do you will discover that God is the most open-minded being that can exist. The mists of mortal open-mindedness disappoint when compared to the infinite horizons of divinity. Hang on, because the path prepared for you has been leveled and lighted and curbed, and from time to time there are scenic overlooks that allow you to see beyond the mist and to catch a glimpse of the Tree. Of course, hanging on is hard. It requires hard work, and patience and reflection. It requires a simple faith in the Journey: Father sent me on this trip because he knew it would be good for me, that the journey would help me become something I could not become if I stayed home. But he really wants me back, and so he provided a way, the Way, and a railing (the rod, the Word), and he pleads, “dear child, hang on, because the voices from the mist that cry out, ‘be this or do that’ have no idea of what you are truly capable of being and doing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that in the old days the god Thor drew a circle around the Middle Earth in order to constrain the forces of evil. Each year these forces grew stronger and the forces of good inside the circle were unable to resist. Finally, Woden, the god of wisdom, left the protection of Thor’s circle and went in search of the king of the trolls (leaving home, confronting adversity). He located the king, put him in an arm-lock, and demanded to know how Good might defeat Evil. “Give me one of your eyes,” replied the troll, “and I will tell you.” Woden considered the proposal and finally decided that the sacrifice was worth the knowledge. He plucked out an eye and handed it to the king. “Now tell me,” he demanded. The troll replied, “watch with both eyes.” The trolls in the mist offer a one-eyed bargain. At first it seems like a good deal, maybe even the only deal, but it is counterfeit compared to the stereoscopic whole sightedness available to diligent, patient and reflective travelers who hang on.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Tis not so; all is right.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Gird up your loins; fresh courage take.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our God will never us forsake;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And soon we’ll have, this tale to tell—</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All is well!&nbsp; All is well!<a href="#_edn12">[12]</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote, “All the easy things that the Church has had to do have been done, so you’re going to live in a time of high adventure. You were brought to this earth because you can handle that time of adventure, and you will do well.” That all is well as we do well is my testimony, because our Father and His son know us, and they miss us - longing for our company -- and they really want us back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

http://devotional.byuh.edu/media160503<br><title>“I’ll Go Where You Want Me to Go Dear Lord, I’ll Be What You Want Me to Be” | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>3 May, 2016<br />JoAnne Lowe<br />International Admission Analyst, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I remember as a youth in the Church, when young men and women left for missions, we sang the hymn:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Over mountain or plain or sea;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I’ll be what you want me to be” <a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I always referred to this hymn as the “mission farewell” hymn since the words were so appropriate. But as years have gone by, I realized that the words to this hymn are not just for those who serve missions but for all of us as we ask ourselves: “Am I willing to go where the Lord wants me to go and am I willing to be what He wants me to be?” Am I willing to allow Him to mold me into what he wants me to become, which is my very highest potential, to be like Him so that He can share all He has with me?</p>
<p>55 years ago, two faithful missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, were where the Lord wanted them to be, and doing what the Lord wanted them to do, as they were tracting house to house in the Sandhills area of Wailuku, Maui. It was a hot day and in those days the missionaries did not have cars but walked everywhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elders Dwight Flickenger and Michael Mickelson walked down our long driveway and knocked on our front door. My mother, Katherine Gima, was home and opened the door. Seeing the Elders, she quickly but politely stated that we were Christian and that she was not interested in hearing what they had to say. She had them wait on the porch as she went to get glasses of cold water to quench their thirst. My mother actually had 2 older sisters, Ethel and Lillian who had joined the Church on Oahu, so she had heard a little about the Church and knew that these were Mormon missionaries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My brother and I were attending St. Anthony School, a Catholic school. We were not catholic but my parents felt like this school would give us a good education so we were enrolled there. In fact, my mother refused to join the Catholic Church because being the extremely practical person she was, she could not understand or accept their doctrine of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost being one person. How could 3 people be one being? &nbsp;</p>
<p>So as my mother took the empty glasses of water from the missionaries and was about to close the front door, one of them said, “Do you know that we believe that Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are 3 separate beings?” Well, the front door opened widely and she invited them in. After that first discussion, the missionaries made an appointment to meet with my father and rest of the family, which consisted of myself being the eldest child and my brother Ron and younger sister Leona. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember that night quite well, as my mother kept us children in the kitchen as she prepared glasses of juice for us to take to the missionaries and our Dad. She held us back as she said, that Dad would probably ask them to leave in a few minutes. Well the minutes went by and she finally sent us out to see what was up. My Dad who was a quiet man, was chuckling and having a good old conversation with these two Elders as they were chatting about golfing. You see my Dad was an avid Sunday golfer and he had a whole trophy case full of trophies to show for all the golf tournaments he won. The missionaries had not even begun talking about the gospel but were talking about golfing!! Well a few months later, after hearing all the discussions, my father, mother and I being 9 years old, were baptized in Waiehu, Maui.</p>
<p>I will be eternally grateful to these two humble, faithful missionaries who taught my family the gospel, who listened to the prompting of the Holy Ghost as they stood on our front porch and said what the Lord wanted them to say concerning the Godhead. These missionaries have become lifelong friends and we share a strong bond of love for each other. Although Dwight Flickenger has passed away, we still keep in contact with Mike Mickelson. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also be eternally grateful to my mother and father for accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ and doing what the Lord wanted them to do. Their acceptance of the gospel and staying faithful to its teachings, mapped and changed our whole lives. As an adult, I realize even more the sacrifices my parents had to make. They had to be willing to change some of their lifestyle and habits, which many people rather not do in midlife.</p>
<p>My father changed his golfing schedule from Sunday to Saturdays. This meant that he would not be meeting with his Sunday golfing buddies, which he had done for years. He also gave up many tournaments since they were usually held on Sundays. When the Church started having golfing tournaments, which were held on Saturdays, my father competed and enjoyed those immensely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My father was the oldest of 10 children. He was the eldest of 9 boys in a row with the 10th child being the only girl. He had a brother who was a Baptist preacher and who was very saddened and disappointed that my father would join the Mormon Church. Yet my father was willing to accept the gospel because he knew it was true. We were sealed as a family in the Laie Hawaii Temple a year after we were baptized. My parents never wavered in the gospel, they held many positions in the church and even served a temple mission in Tokyo, Japan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are pioneers as you are the first in your family to accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, or the first to gain a university education, or the 1st missionary or the first temple member. It takes courage and discipline to be a pioneer and to do what the Lord wants you to do since you may not have the support of your family and friends and may be ridiculed instead.</p>
<p>You may ask how do we know what the Lord wants us to be and what he wants us to do? We do this by seeing ourselves clearly.</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchdorf explained what this means in the October 2014 General Conference: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Being able to see ourselves clearly is essential to our spiritual growth and well-being. If our weaknesses and shortcomings remain obscured in the shadows, then the redeeming power of the Savior cannot heal them and make them strengths. Ironically, our blindness toward our human weaknesses will also make us blind to the divine potential that our Father yearns to nurture within each of us. So how can we see ourselves as He sees us? We must approach our Eternal Father with broken hearts and teachable minds. We must be willing to learn and to change.”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Many times the only way we learn and change, the only times we see our weaknesses and strengths is when the Lord allows us to go through trials like sickness or injuries, death of loved ones, financial struggles or other hardships. As we go through these hard times, if we keep looking to Him, trusting in His wisdom, accepting His will, being grateful for each blessing, doing all we can to endure, then we are on the way to becoming what He wants us to be. As the hymn says, “O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide, Tho dark and rugged the way. So Trusting my all to thy tender care, and knowing thou lovest me, I’ll do thy will with a heart sincere; I’ll be what you want me to be.”<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Sister Neill F. Marriott in October 2015 General Conference stated:</p>
<p>“Paradoxically, in order to have a healed and faithful heart, we must first allow it to break before the Lord. “Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit,” the Lord declares. The result of sacrificing our heart, or our will, to the Lord is that we receive the spiritual guidance we need.</p>
<p>With a growing understanding of the Lord’s grace and mercy, we will find that our self-willed hearts begin to crack and break in gratitude. Then we reach for Him, yearning to yoke ourselves to the Only Begotten Son of God. In our brokenhearted reaching and yoking, we receive new hope and fresh guidance through the Holy Ghost.”<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>It is difficult to change negative habits and traditions especially if we are immersed by these in our daily life.</p>
<p>My father-in-law, Samuel Kaina Lowe came from extremely humble beginnings. He was as he describes it, “poorer than poor”. Please allow me to read his words: &nbsp;</p>
<p>“As the first born son, I grew up in a family with an abusive father who preferred to gamble and drink away his paycheck, forcing my mother to somehow provide for seven children. To obtain food my mother caught salt water crabs with her bare hands. She caught fresh water shrimp with a net in the Nuuanu stream and gathered seaweed from the brackish waters off Waikiki. She gathered discarded tuna fish heads and bones from the fishermen on the docks. From the ground she picked breadfruit and mangoes that had fallen from their trees. I experienced going without food for days at a time. As a result, my mother had to give away two of my younger brothers because she couldn’t feed them anymore. Losing her sons forever and her total sacrifice of giving them up, took its toll and broke her heart. But she knew my brothers would have something to eat and have a better life with their new families.</p>
<p>One day I stepped on broken glass that severed a major blood vessel in my foot. The bleeding would not stop. We couldn’t afford an ambulance so my mother packed me on her back and carried me over five miles to Queens Hospital. She was drenched with my blood when she released me to the doctors. But her fear that I was going to die and her love for me gave her the strength to get help for me.</p>
<p>Fear also meant abuse by my father. My mother was severely beaten and abused by my father each time he came home drunk. My mother died at the early age of 38, heart-broken with a massive stroke. I was fourteen. My mother, friend and care-giver and the only person who loved and cared about me was dead. I had no will to live. However, after witnessing the abuse that my father afflicted upon my mother over the years, I vowed never, never to strike a woman! And I am proud to say that I have kept that promise. My fear of following in my dad’s footsteps of abuse, “like father, like son”, had been turned around in my life, for I am not like my father. My mother’s love for me taught me that fear and abuse can be controlled, and her love for me knew no fear as she protected me and raised me into a man.” I need to add that his father in later years did change his life and became a man of great faith and one who actively lived the gospel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father-in-law, was true to his word, he never not ever abused my mother-in-law. He broke that evil tradition and instead showed great love and respect for his wife. He allowed Heavenly Father to mold him into the best person he could be. Besides serving as a leader in the Church wherever they lived; Johnson Island, California, Kansas, Mississippi, England and Hawaii, he served as a counselor in the Laie Hawaii temple under 4 presidents, served in the Hawaii Mission Presidency for 7 years and then served a mission in the Family History Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am eternally blessed as I married his son, Warren Kahele Kaina Lowe. Because his father broke that cycle of abuse, Warren was a kind, supportive and gentle husband –a perfect father for 6 daughters.</p>
<p>My husband learned wisdom in his youth and was always willing to go where the Lord wanted him to go and to do what the Lord wanted him to do. He had a calm demeanor because he had an eternal perspective on life and trusted the Lord 100%. But he still had to be refined and was sorely tested several times in his life. During the latter part of his working career, he was a controller for a very prestigious company in downtown Honolulu. He was asked to make inaccurate accountings on reports which he refused to do. He was told that if he would not do the reports as they asked, he would lose his job and they would make it so he could not get another job. Knowing this, he still refused to be dishonest so he lost his job. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He could not find fulltime employment for a whole year. This was a very difficult trial as he was not asking the Lord for a new car or a swimming pool, but to find decent employment to support his family, a basic righteous desire. Instead of being impatient or frustrated he kept living the gospel, paying tithing and continued to serve in his callings. He did not take his frustrations out on his family but instead kept saying that what he was going through was not near to what Job had experienced in losing possessions, his health, his friends and finally his family. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He kept his eternal vision and was willing to be even more humble and allow the Lord to mold him and refine him. It was a grueling year. But almost a year to the day, his trial was over as he found full time employment once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are promised in 1 Corinthians 10:13 that the Lord will not allow us to go through trials or tests that are more than we can bear. It reads “…but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>God promises that He will not allow us to go through trials or temptations that will overcome us. This promise means that each one of us has the power and fortitude to conquer whatever comes our way. And we do not do this alone, we have the Lord’s all powerful help each step of the way. If we choose to humble ourselves and ask, He will help us. He does not take away the trial but helps us pull the load which makes our burdens lighter and eases our suffering and brings comfort, understanding, peace and acceptance to our hearts. If we fail, it is not because the trial or task is too hard or difficult, but we fail because we choose to give up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So what holds us back from going where the Lord wants us to go and becoming what He wants us to become. In 2nd Timothy 1:7 it says: “The Lord does not give us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love and a sound mind.” <a href="#_edn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>If the Lord does not give us the spirit of fear, who does? Where does the spirit of fear come from? Who wants us to fail and be miserable like him? Who wants to hold us back, does not want us to progress and be better? Who wants us to think that we just don’t have what it takes? Satan wants to destroy us. Satan gives us the spirit of fear.</p>
<p>But our Heavenly Father gives us “power”, His power, which is the power of His priesthood that blesses all of our lives, male and female. He gives us spiritual power that comes as we make and keep sacred covenants. The power for good cannot be under estimated. His power replaces fear.</p>
<p>He give us “love”, His pure love, true charity that is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, all powerful love that can love the sinner and not the sin. Because of this pure love, He atoned for our sins and tears, pain and suffering so we can be sustained and we can live. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He gives us a “sound mind” to think clearly as we listen and follow the promptings of the 3rd member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost, who can be our constant companion, if we choose. A sound mind to make wise decisions, to see things as they really are, to have an eternal perspective. What huge blessings these are for us.</p>
<p>How do we keep doing what the Lord wants us to do? Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p>1.Look to our patriarchal blessings, which is our own “liahona”, a very personal guide that allows us to see our spiritual potential. It allows us to see ourselves as Heavenly Father sees us.</p>
<p>2.Look to the House of Light – Hale La’a – the temple that literally gives light to our minds, bodies and spirit. In Mosiah chapter 2 when the people gathered around the temple to hear King Benjamin, each family faced the door of their tent towards the temple, to better hear the words of their king. Are we facing the doors of our tents, the doors to our hearts and minds to the temple? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so proud and pleased at the number of students that work in the temple or who weekly go to do baptisms. You are so busy with school, work and have an active social life, yet you make the time to do a sacred work because you understand early in your life the eternal blessings that come from being in the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>3.Sister Neill Marriot suggested in her October 2015 General Conference talk that during the sacrament, which she calls the heart of the Sabbath, after she prays for forgiveness she asks Heavenly Father, “Father, is there more?" She goes on to say “When we are yielded and still, our minds can be directed to something more we may need to change—something that is limiting our capacity to receive spiritual guidance or even healing and help.”<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a> So, let’s ask the Lord “is there more that I can do”?</p>
<p>4.Like breathing air, drinking water and eating are essential to living, personal prayer and scripture study are essentials of living the gospel. Our testimonies will not be able to survive without these essentials that lead to personal revelation from the Lord and His guidance and instructions.</p>
<p>My favorite scripture is found in 2 Nephi 31:20 which says: “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.”<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>This archaic piece of equipment is rarely seen or used now days. It is an iron and when plugged in, heats up and if we add water into the hole at the top, the water gets hot and produces steam, so that as we press our wrinkled clothing it makes them smooth and beautiful. We must press forward using heat and even steam from the trials and life experiences that Heavenly Father allows us to go through, to iron out the wrinkles in our lives. If we do not press forward, we will be pushed backwards. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next verse in 2 Nephi 31:21 it says: “And now behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way, and there is none other way nor name given under heaven where by man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen”. <a href="#_edn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>So, brothers and sisters, may we work every day doing all that we can to live the gospel of Jesus Christ so that we can say: “I WILL GO where you want me to go, Dear Lord and I WILL BE what you want me to be.” And from another favorite hymn: “here’s my heart, oh take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above”. I pray that we may do so. In the name of Jesus Christ Amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media160426<br><title>A Monument Unto the Lord | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>26 April, 2016<br />Leilani Auna<br />Director of Counseling &amp; Disability Services, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Thank you Van for that introduction.</p>
<p>Aloha BYU Hawaii Ohana!</p>
<p>You are an amazing sight! It is wonderful to be gathered with you!</p>
<p>I humbly invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost as I speak to you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we think of monuments we think of some sort of physical memorial, something of great importance and value.</p>
<p>The dictionary further defines a monument as a statue, building, or other structure erected to commemorate a famous or notable person or event. It also goes on to say it is an outstanding, enduring, and memorable example of something.</p>
<p>At Pearl Harbor, the Arizona Memorial helps us to remember the events that occurred on December 7, 1941.</p>
<p>Just outside the Cannon Activities Center we have another monument that memorializes the work of Jonathan Napela and George Q. Cannon in translating the Book of Mormon into the Hawaiian language.</p>
<p>In the scriptures, we read in the book of Joshua about the children of Israel’s miraculous crossing of the River Jordan. The Lord commanded Joshua to have twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, carry the Ark of the Covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, into the River Jordan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on the dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.” <a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Waters were once again parted for the children of Israel. But before Israel moved on, Joshua received another commandment from the Lord. A representative from each tribe was to pick up a large stone from the dry river bed and stack the stones as a memorial.</p>
<p>“And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</p>
<p>Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</p>
<p>For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over.”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>As you stack the stones of your life experiences, what kind of memorial or monument are you building? How are your stones stacking up?</p>
<p>Let me offer five suggestions to help us, as we build our monuments unto the Lord:</p>
<p>1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Enjoy God’s creations with gratitude &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Remember you are a child of God</p>
<p>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Love and respect yourself</p>
<p>4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Love thy neighbor as thyself</p>
<p>5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Gain and fortify your testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1.&nbsp;ENJOY GOD’S CREATIONS WITH GRATITUDE</strong><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>We live on this beautiful island of Oahu. We feel the warmth of the sun daily. We see the rainfall which makes the plants grow and provides us with clean water to drink. As we drive along Kamehameha Highway we see the turquoise blue ocean, the majestic mountains and the clear blue sky. How good it is to hear the soothing sound of waves breaking on the shoreline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all need to take some time to enjoy these heavenly creations. You know for too long I have taken for granted this place that I live. I tell my children all the time it is important to take some time to enjoy nature and be grateful for this beautiful place we live. Everything that is created in this world is a testament that there is a God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also very grateful to my mother Leonarda Cruz Dumaguin for her sacrifice and example of Christ-like love. She had the courage to learn about Jesus Christ, recognized the truth and was baptized. My mother has a green thumb and has a love for plants. She lives in a place on the Big Island that appears to be the most unfriendly place to grow anything. Her land is covered by lava rock. However, she did not let that stop her from making her land a piece of heaven. She continued to sow the earth and was determined to nourish and nurture the seeds which she planted. Her labors are now coming to fruition. She finds joy in her work. She continues to be a good example to me of someone who is grateful for everything around her.</p>
<p>Plant life and animal life were also made to give us joy. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord said,</p>
<p>"Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart;</p>
<p>Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</p>
<p>And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion.</p>
<p>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments."<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Having gratitude in our hearts brings good feelings and builds character. There is something about thinking positively and having gratitude that rewires our brain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Scientists say that doing these things shift our thinking from negative outcomes to positive ones, it elicits a surge of feel good hormones like dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin, endorphins and in building enduring personal connections.</p>
<p>When we show gratitude we are showing respect for the things that we have. We are acknowledging the efforts of those we come in contact with. We are letting our Heavenly Father know we love and respect him.</p>
<p>Just imagine how you would feel if you have worked hard at something and went out of your way to help someone and they just ignored you. How would you feel? Of course when you give true service we do it with love and with no expectations. But the person receiving the service can reciprocate the positive feelings by expressing gratitude.</p>
<p>Joseph B. Wirthlin said,</p>
<p>"Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. &nbsp;We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, and more likeable. When you cultivate an attitude of gratitude in your daily relationships, you are letting the person know to whom you are communicating with that they are important and that you have respect for them. Always remember to say 'thank you'."<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2.&nbsp;REMEMBER YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD</strong></p>
<p>You have a divine heritage. You have a Heavenly Father and Mother. You knew them well and they know you. You have an elder brother Jesus Christ who loves you. He atoned for our sins so we can have a way to return to our Heavenly Father again if we truly repent and accept his atonement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Genesis 1:26-27 it says,</p>
<p>"And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness… So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>In General Conference October 2015 President Thomas S. Munson said,</p>
<p>"To each of you, I say that you are a son or daughter of our Heavenly Father. You have come from His presence to live on this earth for a season, to reflect the Savior’s love and teachings, and to bravely let your light shine for all to see. When that season on earth has ended, if you have done your part, yours will be the glorious blessing of returning to live with Him forever."<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Knowing who you are and where you came from can give you direction and confidence in your life. You have a purpose and a goal. The more you search the scriptures, ponder and pray the more the mysteries of God will be unfolded to you. &nbsp;We all have the opportunity to learn more about what to do with the knowledge that we are children of God. Life is not easy it comes with all kinds of distractions and physical limitations but if we continue to keep our eye on the purpose of why we are here it will make our time here on this earth more meaningful to us.</p>
<p>In Moses 1:39 the Lord said,</p>
<p>"For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Don’t you feel privileged to know that God’s work is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man? Why are we so important to him? It is because we are His Children. God has provided this beautiful world for us and has given us a body to experience our free agency.</p>
<p>Even though God’s creations are many, He knows and loves them all. In the scripture found in Moses 1: 35 it reads.</p>
<p>"All things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them."<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>As a comparison scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants 11:20 the Lord tell us what we must do,</p>
<p>"Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your might, mind and strength."<a href="#_edn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>I sometimes imagine myself in the preexistence getting ready to come to earth and to gain a body. I imagine myself being so anxious and excited hugging and kissing Heavenly Father and Mother. I imagine myself telling them “Don’t worry, I will be back, I will make good choices and I will let my brothers and sisters know about the gospel of Jesus Christ so we can all return back to our Heavenly Home. Of course in the eyes of our Heavenly parents they would look at me with full confidence and with tears in their eyes, they let me go to earth.</p>
<p>To have the knowledge that I am a child of God gives me strength and courage to move on in this life and to make good choices.</p>
<p>David A. Bednar in his General conference talk “The Tender Mercies of the Lord” he said,</p>
<p>"Heavenly Father’s work is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children. Our work is to keep His commandments with all of our might, mind, and strength- and we thereby become chosen and, through the Holy Ghost, receive and recognize the tender mercies of the Lord in our daily lives."<a href="#_edn10">[10]</a><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
<p>I used to wonder as a young girl how can my Heavenly Father know me when he has millions of children to worry about? This baffled me for a long time until I became a parent myself. As a young mother, people would ask how do you share your love equally to all of your children. My household was pretty busy with little children running around, errands to run, piano lessons, sport practices and church duties to deal with. But even with all the busyness I am able to love them individually. As my children grew into their teens we had a lot of let’s say, “Emotional situations” but that did not stop me from loving each one of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have watched my children grow to the wonderful adults they are today. And even with that knowledge, I have only an inkling of an understanding of what it is like to love each of my children compared to our Heavenly Father’s love towards each of us.</p>
<p>In the Gospel Principles manual it states:</p>
<p>"Every person who was ever born on earth is our spirit brother or sister. Because we are the spirit children of God, we have inherited the potential to develop His divine qualities. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can become like our Heavenly Father and receive a fullness of joy."<a href="#_edn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>So if you ever feel like giving up, know this truth you are a son or daughter of Our Heavenly Father and he knows you very well. We have had a veil put over our minds to block our memory of the preexistence. This was done so we can learn how to live in our mortal body today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3.&nbsp;LOVE AND RESPECT YOURSELF</strong></p>
<p>As a licensed clinical social worker I am privileged to meet people from all walks of life. I do however, notice that most of the underlying issues that people come to see me about are the loss of self-love and self-respect. I would like to explain how self-love and self-respect are important in building our monument unto the Lord.</p>
<p>Take care of your physical body. Remember your body is a temple. You must nourish your body with good things. Obey the word of wisdom. Eat healthy, keep your body clean physically and spiritually. By doing this you are making your body your temple.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that as a steward of my body it is important to keep in mind my purpose in life, why am I here and where am I going? To have that knowledge that I chose to be here on this earth in this body at this time is comforting. I am grateful for this opportunity to grow and learn with this body because it makes my life more meaningful. I can see now how important it is to have self-love. Our body is where our spirit dwells and that we can allow the Spirit of the Lord to be with us daily.</p>
<p>Our relationship with other people and our ability to make choices are all done through our physical bodies. It is through our physical body that we experience kindness, happiness, tenderness, pain, disappointments and physical limitations in ways that will prepare us for eternity. When we have respect for our body by keeping it clean and healthy it makes our spirit feel loved and respected. We can continue to cultivate that sense of self love and respect, the same way we prepare ourselves to enter the Temple of the Lord. It is also important to cultivate that same feelings when we go about our daily routines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Self-Love and selfishness or narcissism are two absolutely different things. To have self-love is more than just thinking about me. Love is all about giving and receiving and if you can give enough, care, attention and sympathy to yourself, most probably you can give it to others as well. It is hard to love others if we cannot love ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to expound on this a little more.</p>
<p>The Prophet in the last October 2015 conference said,</p>
<p>"We know that our body is a temple, to be treated with reverence and respect. Our minds should be filled with uplifting and ennobling thoughts and kept free from those things which will pollute. In order to have the Holy Ghost as our constant companion, we must be worthy. Brothers and sisters, purity will bring us peace of mind and will qualify us to receive the Savior’s promises. Said He, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. ”As we prove to be examples in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity, we will qualify to be lights to the world."<a href="#_edn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In Matthew 22:35-40 it reads:</p>
<p>"Then one of them, (which was) a lawyer, asked (him a question), tempting him, and saying, Master, which (is) the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second (is) like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."<a href="#_edn13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4.&nbsp;LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THY SELF<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>Stop gossiping. If you have a problem with someone, talk to him or her directly. Let us speak kind words to each other. When you gossip, but fail to tell the source of your problem, you are misdirecting your anger. You are also missing an opportunity to learn and expand your relationship by not getting to know that individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second great commandment is to love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p>There is a significant difference in being a narcissist and loving yourself. The term narcissism originates from Greek mythology. The young Narcissus fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool of water. The dictionary further defines narcissism as a person who is overly self-involved, and often vain and selfish. Narcissism is the pursuit of gratification from vanity or egotistic admiration of one’s own attributes.</p>
<p>Loving thy neighbor as thy self is a true statement. Loving your self is loving, and being a narcissist is just selfishness which is not loving</p>
<p>When you love yourself you are giving love, attention and care to yourself, but when you stop loving yourself, then you stop caring for yourself.</p>
<p>When you love yourself and do not extend to others, then it becomes selfishness. The flow of loving yourself and loving others is a giving and receiving.</p>
<p>Imagine getting up in the morning and looking in the mirror and saying to yourself, “Ugh you are ugly!” Or even worse, you ignore yourself. Imagine doing that to your friend or roommate daily. How do you think they will feel? They will probably feel bad and ignored. Let us take it one step further, we forget that the person in the mirror staring back at us is a person too. We need to talk kindly to ourselves and treat ourselves with love and respect. When we do that we are cultivating a positive countenance that will be projected to others. We are also inviting the Holy Ghost into our lives. Remember, what I said earlier our body is a temple of God. We need to invite the good Spirit and cultivate a positive thinking within ourselves. When we do this we are rewiring our brain and how we think. Like I said earlier, the feel good hormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins will be activated and we start making personal connections which is vital in our emotional health. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever been next to someone and you can feel the negative vibes? We can change that by practicing to cultivate a love and respect of self so in turn we can project those to others.</p>
<p>Treating each other as we would like to be treated is a true statement. When we serve others we are making connections in our brains which is important for our emotional health and relationships. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, Life is all about relationships. We have different types of relationship with people that we meet each day. At work, school, home, and everyone that we encounter throughout our day. When we continue to have that love and respect for ourselves we will project it to others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful to my father Celestino Dumaguin, who served as one of the pioneer missionaries to the Far East Hong Kong Philippine mission. Through his missionary service he was able to find the home of my mother in the city of Cavite, Philippines. He and his companion, Elder Mark Evans, were able to teach her the Gospel of Jesus Christ and baptize her. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although my father has already passed on, he left a legacy of good works. By profession, he was a shiatsu therapist. &nbsp;He used this talent to relieve those in pain and discomfort. He also used traditional Hawaiian and Chinese medicinal remedies that were taught to him by his grandmother. He became a respected healer or in Hawaiian, a kahuna or medicine man. People would come from all over the islands to have him attend to their ailments. The majority of the time he would do it free of charge or they would pay him whatever they could. I asked him one day. Dad where do your healing talents come from? He looked at me and said, ‘from Heavenly Father, of course'.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</p>
<p>And to others it is given to have faith to heal."<a href="#_edn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>I realized at that moment that my father loved the Lord and acknowledged the Lord in all things. Remembering his works and the way he lived his life uplifts me daily. He used his talents to glorify his Father in Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mother till this day continues to feed and house strangers and treat them as if they were part of her family. The missionaries knew that if they were around her home they were always welcome at her house for a rest or something to eat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Both my parents love the missionaries. The way my parents lived their lives, became a testament to me that they loved God and followed the example of His Son Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also grateful for teachers that taught me about my Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. They were good examples to me of one who loves the Lord. They truly were practicing what they preached.</p>
<p>I acknowledge with deep appreciation the love and great examples of people in my own life; &nbsp;</p>
<p>My loving parents, family, friends, children, and wonderful eternal companion who by their examples are spiritual monuments unto the Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5.&nbsp;GAIN AND FORTIFY YOUR TESTIMONY OF THE SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST</strong></p>
<p>Know that God lives and He hears and answers prayers. He knows each and every one of us. Follow the example of Jesus Christ for he is the ultimate example of someone who loves God the Father, he knows who He is. He loves each and every one of us and atoned for all of our sins so we can have the opportunity to live with Our Heavenly Father again. Get to know our Savior Jesus Christ by studying His life and His teachings. We can do this by studying the scriptures and praying to our Heavenly Father for daily guidance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayer is a sincere, heartfelt talk with our Heavenly Father. Prayer is one of the greatest blessings we have while we are here on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adhering to the five steps we can become a monument unto the Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We can stand as a witness to God in all things and in all places. We can be a testament that God lives and hears our prayers. We can know Jesus Christ and follow him. We can be an example of a disciple of Christ to all whom we come in contact with. We can be a monument unto the Lord in our own individual lives and in our own families.</p>
<p>We will have a reverence for God and his creations. You will have His countenance on your face. You will exude positive feelings to those with whom you come in contact with.</p>
<p>I am grateful to my Heavenly Father and for His loving guidance throughout my life. To have had the desire at a very young age to come here to attend Brigham Young University-Hawaii. To my Savior Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice so that I can have hope to see my Heavenly Father again someday,</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be employed here at Brigham Young University Hawaii, to have had the experience to study and graduate from this great university, and to work at the Polynesian Cultural Center. I am also very grateful to experience college life in Hale 1 and Hale 5. It was there where I learned how to cook, experience living away from home, and had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world.</p>
<p>I express my deepest love and gratitude to my Heavenly Father for the many privileges and blessings he has given me throughout my life here on earth.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ Amen.</p>

<p>April 19, 2016<br />Anthony Pickard<br />Manager of Security &amp; Risk Management, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Brothers and Sisters, Aloha.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">I’m forever grateful to BYU–Hawaii campus for my temporal and spiritual blessings. On June 1, 1915, during his last visit to Laie, President Joseph F. Smith dedicated the site for a temple. Then, on Thanksgiving Day 1919, President Heber J. Grant consecrated the completed structure. In his dedicatory prayer, President Grant mentions with gratitude the Lord’s promise to Brother Cluff, 55 years earlier, of a temple. Laie was now poised to be a spiritual and transcendent gathering place not only for the people of the Pacific, but for the entire world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Then, just a little over two years later, Elder David O. McKay visited Laie in 1921 while on a world tour of the Church. He was profoundly moved by a flag-raising ceremony at the LDS elementary school with 127 children from different ethnic backgrounds, saluting America’s great symbol of freedom within the care of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Born within his soul was a conviction that Laie would be the educational and spiritual center of the Church in the islands. Later, as President of the Church College of Hawaii on February 12, 1955, [in the dedication of the campus] he recalled his visionary experience of the 1921 flag-raising ceremony, which is now memorialized in a grand mosaic depiction at the front foyer of the BYU–Hawaii Campus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">President McKay’s dedicatory address and prayer at the ground breaking, and again at the completion of the permanent physical plant in 1958, established once and for all the grand principles and purposes of the newly constructed BYU–Hawaii:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.The institution will help unite peoples of all races by the gospel of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.The Lord inspired early prophets to secure this land as a gathering place for Hawaiians and other races.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.Church members must “study and treasure the things of education in all fields”<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4.The priority emphasis of the college will pertain to the things of God and the development of character to &nbsp; &nbsp;make<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span>noble men and women.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5.The students educated here will become leaders everywhere, for “all the world is hungry for them.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6.All who teach here must have a deep testimony that “God has had his hand over this entire valley, that &nbsp; &nbsp;dedication offered years ago was inspired, and this land is a choice land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>7.The influence of the men and women educated here “will be felt for good toward the establishment of &nbsp; &nbsp;peace<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span>internationally.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>8.God inspired and has approved the creation of the college.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>9.The campus will be a missionary factor influencing millions of people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>10.Each building is to radiate an aura of light influencing all to “live clean and upright lives.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>11.This institution is to hold the respect of sister educational institutions and wield an influence throughout the &nbsp; &nbsp;world<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span>of good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">In August of 1977, after considering to play football for a small college in Oregon, I accepted a talent award to play small college basketball for BYU–Hawaii – this was a life changing decision for me. I was recruited by Norman Kaluhiokalani, also known as Coach K. I enjoyed playing football for the Kahuku Red Raiders, but basketball was my passion. In preparation for college basketball, I would practice my basketball skills for nearly eight hours a day after graduating from high school until the time I enrolled at BYU–Hawaii in August of 1977. Coach K. was my first contact with a BYU–Hawaii faculty member and he had a positive influence on my final decision to attend BYU–Hawaii. After graduating from high school, in June of 1977, Coach K. took me to the Polynesian Cultural Center and introduced me to Brother Magalei. Brother Magalei offered me a job as a canoe tour guide. They helped me secure my first job as a canoe tour guide. &nbsp;I spent the summer of 1977 working at the Polynesian Cultural Center before I enrolled at BYU–Hawaii. This is when I first learned of the partnership between the Polynesian Cultural Center and the Brigham Young-Hawaii campus. For the next four years I would work at the Polynesian Cultural Center, play college basketball at BYU&shy;–&shy;Hawaii and receive many temporal and spiritual blessings. I learned the importance of hard work even before I enrolled into Brigham Young University-Hawaii.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">I would like to highlight sections in President McKay’s dedicatory address and prayer in relationship to my BYU–Hawaii experiences:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>The institution will help unite peoples of all races by the gospel of Jesus Christ.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">When I arrived at BYU–Hawaii, I was a young adult from the small town of Kahuku. I was not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I was out of my comfort zone. I knew of the LDS church because there were “Mormons” who attended Kahuku High School and some of them were my friends on the football and basketball teams. But when I came to BYU–Hawaii, the school was united among many races because of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I discovered that the students were from many nations, but they got along with each other because they were of one faith. I witnessed the Church at BYU–Hawaii bring international students together from all over the world, including students from the mainland United States. I enjoyed meeting students from all over the world. &nbsp;Pioneers of BYU–Hawaii small-college basketball program, my new college teammates were Hiram Akina, Mike Apo, James Niumatalolo, Dean Smith, Carl Stent, Mike Svien, Richard Vierra, Keli Lobendahn, Frank Buttel and Steve Kaui. These were the players when BYU–Hawaii fielded its first collegiate basketball team in 1977-1978. As members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), we were able to develop early rivalries with fellow state schools Chaminade University of Honolulu, Hawaii Pacific University, and University of Hawaii at Hilo. These three rivalries continue to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>Church members must study and treasure the things of education in all fields.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">During my first semester at BYU–Hawaii, I had to take the Basic English and Mathematics courses before I could enroll into freshmen level courses. For the English basic writing course, I did not receive a passing grade on my final writing easy. I had to retake the final in order to continue my college education and to remain eligible to play college basketball. While other students were enjoying their Christmas break I had to take a remedial writing course. I spent eight hours a day, Monday thru Friday for two weeks in class from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. just to qualify to retake the final essay and to receive credits for the course. I also worked nineteen hours a week at the PCC during this time. On the day of the retake essay, the instructor advised us that all students in attendance were required to take the remedial training in order to qualify for the final essay. Only five students of the twenty plus students in attendance were eligible to retake the examination that day. My coach Dan Smith was so proud of me, that he walked from the university to the PCC canoe landing area and told me the good news that I had passed the Basic English Course. This helped me to remain eligible to play basketball for the rest of the season.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Also during my first semester at BYU–Hawaii I enjoyed taking Math from Brother Richard Coburn. Brother Coburn was brilliant in math and you had to work hard to receive a passing grade.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">I had a difficult time with word problems in his math class. Brother Coburn made himself available for extra help, going over those difficult word problems helping me to feel confident in math. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">As a freshman, I was learning how to manage my time with work, being a full-time student and playing college basketball. I had to put a lot of effort into my first year at college in order to successfully pass all of my classes. This gave me confidence in myself that I could “study and treasure the things of education in all fields”. I also recalled seeing Brother Coburn in the HUB, in my day it was known as the game room, playing ping pong with BYU–Hawaii students. I also played ping pong against Brother Coburn and he would beat me every time. He was an excellent math teacher and an equally great ping pong player on campus. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>The priority emphasis of the college will pertain to the things of God and the development of character to make noble men and women.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">During my freshmen year, I was required to take religion courses. The doctrine was all new to me. The family of Lehi, the Book of Mormon, Zion and calling others on campus Brothers and Sisters were new and different. I began to study and learn more about the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My family and I believed in God but it wasn’t something we practiced daily in life as a member of my religion. During the basketball season, I was receiving “the discussions” from the full-time missionaries and also struggling in my religion classes. I remembered that I was not only receiving a secular education, but also the teachings of God and if you loved him you will keep his commandments. One day before basketball practice in the locker room, I found a wallet on a wooden bench. I picked up the wallet and told my teammate Frank Buttel what I had found. I looked in the wallet to see who it belonged to and I noticed it had approximately a thousand dollars in cash. My teammate looked at me to see what I would do. I remembered the religion courses that I was taking and the discussions I was receiving from the full-time missionaries. There was no doubt, I was going to locate the owner and return the wallet. I found the owner and he was frantically looking for his lost wallet. He said he had cash in the wallet and it was to pay for his schooling. He took the wallet and thanked me when he noticed nothing was missing from his wallet. I felt good about myself because I applied what I learned about God. That weekend we had a basketball game and I was in the zone. I scored 65 points in the game. Later that week on December 16, 1977, I scored 57 points in another game. Did it have anything to do with finding and returning the wallet? Maybe. Maybe not. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>The students educated here will become leaders everywhere for all the world is hungry for them.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Upon my graduation from BYU–Hawaii in June of 1984, I enlisted into the U.S. Army and I advanced in the ranks from a private to an officer in the United States Army and the Hawaii Army National Guard. I became a leader among men from all over the United States of America. In 1985, I married my eternal companion Laura Lei Johnson. After my service in the U.S. Military, in 1988 I became an accountant/administrative assistant for the BYU–Hawaii Physical Plant Department, under Judd Whetten and later a Purchaser for the Presiding Bishopric for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under Robert Owan. In March of 1990, I accepted an invitation to a new agent class for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Quantico, Virginia. I graduated from the new agent’s class and was assigned to the Sacramento, California, Field Office in June of 1990. By this time I had been married for five years with two young sons, Kalani and Kulia, and took my family on a new career and adventure from Kahuku Hawaii to Sacramento, California. Our new Bishop in Sacramento was so happy to have our family in the Northgate Ward. My wife and I were quickly called to lead the Young Men and Young Women programs in our Ward. In 1993 and 1995 my family was blessed with new additions: a son Maka and a daughter Kawai. In 1994, I was called to serve as the Bishop in the Arcade Ward, in the Sacramento California North Stake. This leadership calling was very challenging, but once again my educational and work experience at BYU–Hawaii had helped me develop the leadership skills and abilities I needed to serve in this calling “...things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>All who teach here must have a deep testimony that God has had his hand over this entire valley, that the dedication offered years ago was inspired and this land is a choice land.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">On a visit to BYU–Hawaii when I was in High School I remember visiting the library and how quiet it was, it seemed to be a great place of peace. It truly felt like a place of peace in a choice land.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Each time I tried calling both Chaminade and UH Hilo no one was available to speak to me regarding my interest to play basketball for those universities. I got a return call from Coach K. and he was very interested in having me attend BYU–Hawaii on a basketball talent award. I felt at peace that this was the place for me and to have the opportunity to pursue my first passion, playing college basketball while furthering my education. Chaminade and UH Hilo attempted to contact me but it was too late – I already decided to be a Seasider.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>The influence of the men and women educated here will be felt for good toward the establishment of peace internationally.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">As an FBI Agent I helped protect the constitution of the United States of America by investigating crimes against the U.S. I would travel yearly from September 2008 to August 2014 to American Samoa, Guam, Saipan and Tinian to protect these U.S. Territories from espionage attack. On March 13, 2014, a local defense contractor accused of leaking government secrets to his girlfriend from a foreign land was likely to go to jail for a long time. Sixty-year-old Benjamin Pierce Bishop, a former Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Army, pleaded guilty Thursday, March 13, 2014, in federal court to willfully retaining and communicating classified national defense information to a person not authorized to receive it. Bishop had classified documents at his Hawaii home, including one titled “U.S. Department of Defense China Strategy,” another on U.S. force posture in Asia and the Pacific and a U.S. Pacific Command joint intelligence operations center special report. Bervar, his defense attorney said the two were in love and that the case was about love, and not espionage. Myself and other agents of the Honolulu FBI technical support program covertly, with a court order, gathered evidence to support his guilt in this investigation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">In October of 2010 I was involved in an investigation regarding Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, a former resident of Staten Island, N.Y., registered as a freshman at Kapiolani Community College in August 2009, pursuing a liberal arts degree. He was arrested and held at the federal detention center pending extradition to New York. The FBI in Eastern New York filed a complaint October 21, 2010, accusing Shehadeh of making false statements in matters involving terrorism between June 13, 2008, and February 10, 2009. The complaint stemmed from activities involving Shehedeh while he was a resident of Staten Island and he allegedly devised a plan to travel to Pakistan to join the Taliban or a similar terrorist group. I assisted in capturing audio and video evidence at Shehedeh’s rental home in Honolulu to support that he was going to plan attacks in Hawaii and the mainland United States. This New York and Hawaii FBI terror case was aided by Hawaii Muslims and a former student from BYU–Hawaii to protect peace internationally. In the spring of 2014 I was involved in a manhunt here in Hawaii for a “most-wanted” domestic terrorist. The FBI office in San Francisco said the agency received “credible intelligence “that Daniel Andreas San Diego might be on the state’s Big Island. I searched for him in the island’s eastern district of Puna and in the small, eclectic town of Pahoa. San Diego, 36, was suspected to be an animal rights extremist. He was charged with exploding pipe bombs in front of two San Francisco Bay area companies with ties to a lab that conducted animal experiments. Because I was from Hawaii and understood “Pidgin English” fluently I was instrumental in the search of this most wanted domestic terrorist in Hawaii.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>God inspired and has approved the creation of the college and the campus will be a missionary factor influencing millions of people.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">When I arrived at BYU–Hawaii I wasn’t a member of the Church. I had friends who were members of the “Mormon” Church. Calling each other Brother and Sister was new for me. I took required religion classes and received the missionary discussions. I was interested in joining the church, but it was difficult for my parents to have me change my religion. Then in the summer of 1980, I attended the baptism of my future father-in-law, Warren Johnson Sr., at Temple Beach I felt a special feeling, and was determined that I would get baptized as well. On July 4, 1980, my basketball teammate, Roger Rowberry from Idaho baptized me a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I can remember that early morning. I didn’t have a way to Laie so I ran from Kahuku to the Laie Hawaii Stake Center. The full-time missionaries had me change into my baptism clothing and one of my best friends baptized me. One of the full-time missionaries confirmed me a member of the church. BYU–Hawaii was definitely a missionary factor. I received the gospel and joined the church when I was a student at BYU–Hawaii. The next summer in August of 1981, I entered the Provo Missionary Training Center to serve in the Wisconsin Milwaukee Mission. This was not a lifetime goal for me and if not for the influence I received from my wife, good friends, and people at BYU–Hawaii and PCC, I would not have gone on a mission. It was a difficult decision to graduate from college or to delay my education and serve a mission first. My parents did not understand a mission therefore they did not support it. I would not hear from my parents for two years until I returned from the mission field. What a great opportunity I had to serve the people in Wisconsin. Wisconsin was a foreign land for me the winters were long and cold. I remembered teaching the Littel Family. This Family was contacted by earlier missionaries going door-to-door finding people to teach the gospel. The earlier missionaries baptized two members of the family, but were unable to baptize the parents and two other siblings. My companion and I were able to share the gospel and the aloha spirit. This family became our friends and they wanted to know more about the gospel and beautiful Hawaii. Later the parents were also baptized. Another son and daughter were not baptized but were friendly towards the church. My required religion classes prepared me for my mission. When I entered into the mission field in August of 1981 I had read all of the standard works because it was required at BYU–Hawaii. What a blessing to have done that. Today students from BYU–Hawaii continue to enter into the mission field and serve millions. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>Each building is to radiate an aura of light influencing all to live clean and upright lives.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">When I arrived at BYU–Hawaii there was no Lorenzo Snow Building, Cannon Activities Center or Stake Center Building. What great blessing it is to benefit from the aura of light influencing all to “live clean and upright lives.” When the Cannon Activities Center was completed, Coach Ted Chidester gave me the honor to take the first official basketball shot in the Center. President Spencer W. Kimball, a prophet of God, visited the University and attended a Seasider game. Before the game started, President Kimball came into our locker room to personally greet all the players. During his youth he loved playing basketball. Now a prophet of God was in our locker room. He stood next to Hiram Akina and said, “It feels great that I’m not the shortest person in this locker room,”and he hugged Hiram Akina. Other living prophets of God would teach us in the Cannon Activities Center to “live clean and upright lives.” This is what I personally experienced here in this building. One day I would be making the first lay up in that basketball rim to my right, and later a prophet of God would counsel students, faculty and staff of this university under the same basketball rim.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>This institution is to hold the respect of sister educational institutions and wield an influence throughout the world for good.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">BYU–Hawaii is a great university and it has the respect from other universities throughout the United States and abroad. Many of my co-workers in the Bureau graduated from prestigious Yale, Stanford and Harvard. I worked with them in the Bureau with the same job assignments and opportunities. Students, don’t ever feel that your BYU–Hawaii education is not as competitive and valued as other universities. You can accomplish your goals and be an influence for good throughout the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Upon President McKay’s return from dedicating the New Zealand Temple in May 1958, he stopped in Hawaii to visit the fledgling campus of the Church College of Hawaii. After touring the newly constructed permanent campus, he spoke in a devotional assembly held at the Laie Chapel. Over 2,700 people were in attendance. President Law recorded: “As we sat on the stand during the preliminary music, President McKay turned to me and said: “I am pleased. &nbsp;The college has exceeded all expectations.” Then he added, “President Law, you have the right spirit here. I can feel it. ”Moments later, during his devotional address, he exclaimed, “What hath God wrought? And in vision I see great results from this college in Hawaii. I congratulate all who have been associated with it…. And with all my heart I bless you for the duties ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">What indeed hath God wrought? This present history is one attempt to answer President McKay’s question from the perspective of 60 years, 1955-2015. The story of BYU–Hawaii’s emergence from obscurity and its tiny beginnings as the Church College of Hawaii into what it is today and what it will yet become is a compelling chronicle of faith and hardship not unlike the accounts of many of the other great Church historical accomplishments.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Established by the prophetic clarity of President McKay’s vision and by the faith, courage, sweat, and tears of men and women who clung to his prophecies, the campus was forged “line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little”<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a>, at times in the throes of discouragement, but nearly always with a sense of divine purpose.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">In conclusion, I would like to bear my testimony. I know that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Holy Ghost bears witness to the truthfulness of the gospel. We are now under the leadership of President John S. Tanner and his wife Susan W. Tanner, former Young Women general president. “I am inspired by the vision that prophets have had for BYU–Hawaii,” President Tanner said. “I intend to build on that wonderful legacy of aloha and learning and service that exists here to bless the international Church.” Students, faculty and staff, may we take advantage of the opportunities we now have at BYU–Hawaii. “And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</span></p>

<p>Aloha!</p>
<p>BYU–Hawaii has been a big part of my life. I first came here in 1983 thinking I would stay for a semester and 32 years later look where I have ended up. My husband Sisi lived in Laie while I was going to school and I was lucky enough to cast my line far into the water and snag this prize fish. We left Hawaii in 1987 to see what adventures a military life would offer us. It was just the two of us along with our Toyota truck and not even enough household goods to fill the back of that truck. When we returned to Hawaii in 2001 we had three boys and a whole moving van full of stuff. While living away we would return as often as we could to visit family and enjoy the yummy food, beaches and good weather. It was those times that we could return to Hawaii that would recharge our emotional batteries to tide us over until the next time we could come back. I would like to talk today about returning and in doing so I hope to encourage all to return to search the words that have been provided as a means to strengthen and recharge our spiritual batteries for our mortal journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work in the EIS department where we use databases that hold important information for the university and those associated with it. This information deals with academics, finances and human resources. The databases are very critical as they insure that correct information is provided to those that need it. Throughout the course of my day I often go to this database to look up information that will answer questions that are asked of me and to troubleshoot problems that arise. I have two buttons that help me in this task. They are Search and Return to Search. Search gets me started with the information I need for my initial tasks and Return to Search helps me to retrieve additional information that will provide answers to other questions. This is similar to how we need to return to search the gospel database to make sure we have the correct information and to increase our gospel knowledge. This knowledge will provide the information we need to find truth and happiness in this life and the life to come. Some of those gospel databases we need to include in our search are the scriptures and our prophets and leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a tendency to want the answers now and not have to spend a lot of time searching. None of you are like that, are you? Well in my desire to have an instant answer I was at the temple the other week pondering on what scripture I could share with you that would fit well with my talk. As a sat there pondering all of a sudden I thought of Mosiah….ok, Mosiah what chapter? Mosiah 6… and the verse? Mosiah 6:10. I couldn’t wait to get to the celestial room where I knew there would be scriptures so that I could look it up and see what great counsel awaited. I came into the celestial room and went right past my husband to pick up the scriptures. I sat down and quickly turned the pages to Mosiah…ok found it…Mosiah 6…I’m almost there…what? Mosiah 6 only has 7 verses. I was disappointed but had to laugh at myself because I thought that I had received an earth shattering revelation. So it wasn’t my scripture…in fact it isn’t anyone’s scripture because it doesn’t exist but I eventually received my answer as I “returned to search” for it in the days to come. I think I was being humbled when I was hoping for instant inspiration as Elder Bednar describes as a light being turned on in a dark room but instead I received the answer more like the sun rising where light is gradually increased.<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>So remember answers will come just have faith and be believing just as the scripture I found says in D&amp;C 90:24</p>
<p>“Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>We need to return to search the basics of the gospel. When we have questions we know the source for which we should be finding the answers – the scriptures. By studying and pondering the scriptures daily we receive the Lord’s instructions for us. We all know that reading the scriptures can be a struggle. How many of you have tried to start reading the Book of Mormon and haven’t been able to get past 1st or 2nd Nephi? Yeah, that was me so many times until I came up with a plan. One day I decided to skip 1st and 2nd Nephi and start with Jacob. Sometimes I have to play tricks on my mind and it worked because I felt I was getting somewhere when I quickly completed 5 books (Jacob, Enos, Jarom, Omni, and Words of Mormon). Of course, all but one of those books has only one chapter but I nonetheless had finished 5 books. By that time I felt the desire to feast upon the words and I wanted to keep reading. Alma didn’t even seem that long anymore as I became immersed in the scriptures. Once I finished Moroni I started at the Title Page and read right through 1st and 2nd Nephi as I continued reading through the Book of Mormon once again. By reading the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, I have been able to recognize how these ancient records apply to our times. It has helped me be more aware of how Satan tries to deceive us and try to destroy us. It has also helped me see how much Heavenly Father and Jesus love us and how patient they are with us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading the scriptures gives us confidence in what we have been taught and gives us the ability to defend what we know. J. Richard Clarke as a counselor in the Presiding Bishopric related in an October 1982 conference talk that he grew up in a Mormon town within a Latter-day Saint home. He was taught the principle of prayer and taught to love the Lord. He learned that the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith which he never doubted even as an adult. As a young adult he enlisted in the navy and was surprised to know of so many people who hadn’t heard of Mormonism. He said it was then that he realized how limited his knowledge of the gospel was. He was asked tough questions which he had a hard time answering. He was the only member in his group so he didn’t have anyone to ask for help. The only scriptures he had with him was a small military copy of the Book of Mormon. He related that growing up he didn’t feel a need to study the scriptures and the writings of the prophets. When he tried to answer questions he was only able to state the beliefs he had heard from his family and teachers, he didn’t have his own witness. He tried to compensate for his lack of knowledge by being a good example of what he said he believed.<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>I can relate to Bishop Clarke to a certain point. I didn’t grow up in a Mormon community in fact including me there were only three to four young women in my ward and we all went to different schools until high school. My family converted to the Church when I was young and my parents taught me the principles of the gospel along with other wonderful leaders and teachers. But just like Bishop Clarke I had not made it a priority to study the scriptures beyond what was taught in lessons and seminary. Thank goodness I went to church and seminary to give me enough knowledge to keep me grounded in the gospel. I was always fearful of someone asking me tough questions since I also relied on my families and teachers beliefs. I too would try to be a good example of what the gospel teaches but didn’t have the deep roots the scriptures could provide. I have found so much more knowledge and understanding by reading and studying the scriptures. I feel more firmly planted and feel like I can’t be swayed in my beliefs because I now know for myself. I am far from being a scripture mastery champion but I know that I can find answers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bishop Clarke also quoted The Prophet Joseph Smith who said,</p>
<p>“Search the scriptures—search the revelations which we publish and ask your Heavenly Father, in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, to manifest the truth unto you, and if you do it with an eye single to His glory nothing doubting, He will answer you by the power of His Holy Spirit. You will then know for yourselves and not for another. You will not then be dependent on man for the knowledge of God; nor will there be any room for speculation.… For when men receive their instruction from Him that made them, they know how He will save them.… Again we say: Search the Scriptures, search the Prophets and learn what portion of them belongs to you.”<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>We also need to listen to and ponder the words which are shared by our prophets and leaders of the Church. We just had the opportunity to participate in General Conference. Did we make the sacrifice of our time to listen and receive the counsel given on how to draw closer to our Savior? Did we pray for answers to our questions as we listened to wise counsel? &nbsp;Well if you didn’t thank goodness for the wise use of technology. Go to lds.org and read or watch the conference talks with a humble heart ready to be taught. Listen and you will find answers, I promise. Not everything you hear may be pleasing because it might require us to make changes but it will make us happy if we follow the counsel.</p>
<p>We need to put our trust in the Lord and in His words, as He is the one that has our best interest in mind. There are many loud voices that compete for our time, attention and loyalty so we have to listen carefully for the Lord’s voice as His voice is very quiet. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must be very careful that we don’t start listening to other “voices” that could lead us astray and make us believe things that are not true. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Hales in addressing the young adults in the Oct 2015 General Conference stated,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now, you may have serious questions about the choices ahead. In my young adult years, I sought counsel from my parents and from faithful, trusted advisers. One was a priesthood leader; another was a teacher who believed in me. Both said to me, “If you want my counsel, be prepared to take it.” I understood what that meant. Prayerfully select mentors who have your spiritual well-being at heart. Be careful about taking advice from your peers. If you want more than you now have, reach up, not across!”<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>I love how he says if you want more than you now have, reach up as to a higher level, someone that will pull you up, not across to the same level that will keep you where you are. We have told our boys from a young age that if they had questions they should come ask us and we will give them counsel. Experience, knowledge, maturity, guidance of the spirit and love are what helps parents and other inspired mentors give good counsel. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a strong word of caution be very careful of what you read on social media, in comment sections, and on the Internet as these are often one sided and most authors often hide their identity to stir up contention and doubt. Why would you choose to follow someone you don’t know? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to take you back to about 73 BC. Moroni had just successfully lead the Nephites in defeating the Lamanites. &nbsp;In Alma 45:1 it talks of how the people were grateful for their success and they thanked the Lord and they did “fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.” Their success was because of their righteous desire to defend their homes, liberties, families, and religion. It didn’t take long for things to change because by the end of the chapter pride had made its way into their hearts and Amalickiah who wanted to destroy the Church and take away the people’s freedom was able to flatter many to follow him. This shows that we must always be aware of Satan’s desire to lead us astray and he will use those that are very convincing to misguide us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alma 46:10 it reads,</p>
<p>“Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous’ sake.”<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>How many times do people use words to provoke us to feel we have been wronged or to create angry feelings? That is what Amalickiah was doing and he did it very well. When Amalickiah was chased off by Moroni he didn’t back down but went to the Lamanites to stir them up to go to battle against the Nephites. When the Lamanites hesitated because they had just gotten a big whooping from the Nephites he devised a plan to become king over the Lamanites by deceit and fraud. &nbsp;When they continued to hesitate he sent men to speak from their towers to talk smack about the Nephites. Well it worked because the Lamanites believed what was said from these towers and they “hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to battle against the Nephites” as stated in Alma 48:3.<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a> Could one of the modern day towers that are used to stir people up today be Facebook (or insert any other social media you are familiar with here)? We don’t have the high physical towers made of wood they had back then but there are many sitting on their cyber towers that will share falsehoods and accusations that will try to confuse us.</p>
<p>Good thing for prophets and leaders that are guided by the Spirit and work tirelessly to keep us on track. Moroni didn’t give up on the people as witnessed by him writing the title of liberty, praying for the people and holding the standard up so they could see it and remember what was important. He “had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.” as stated in Alma 48:7.<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a> Moroni was a righteous leader who loved God and feared Him more than man. He was a good man, not a perfect man but one that sought for perfection. &nbsp;Who wouldn’t want to follow such a man? &nbsp;</p>
<p>In these latter days I want to ask you, who is your Moroni? Who do you look to for direction and answers? Who can you trust that doesn’t have his own interest in mind but is only trying to serve the Lord to the best of his ability just like Moroni? &nbsp;Just like Moroni we have our Latter-Day Prophet Pres. Thomas S. Monson who is watching over us, encouraging us and leading us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Children’s Songbook there is a catchy song that I think you all know. I want to share the last verse which applies to our day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now we have a world where people are confused.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you don't believe it, go and watch the news.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We can get direction all along our way,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If we heed the prophets-follow what they say.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Follow the prophet; don't go astray.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Follow the prophet; he knows the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Follow the Prophet, LDS Children’s Songbook)<a href="#_edn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that Pres. Monson is a prophet of God and I know that we can trust the words he speaks and the counsel he gives. I also know that we can be led by the spirit to know what others say are true or false. As it states in D&amp;C 50:24-25:</p>
<p>24 That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</p>
<p>25 And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth, that you may chase darkness from among you;<a href="#_edn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>As we search diligently we will stay rooted in the gospel, as were the sons of Mosiah when Alma saw them after an extended absence.</p>
<p>"Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God."(Alma 17:2)<a href="#_edn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I have felt this joy as I have been reunited with friends that I haven’t seen in a long time and they are active in fulfilling church callings and have continued on the path of righteousness. I have also come across friends who I love very much that have searched the worldly views and have found answers elsewhere besides the solid truth of the gospel. For this I am very sad because they have let the voices of others convince them to turn away from the Gospel. Don’t be deceived, learn the doctrine for yourselves.</p>
<p>Searching alone is not enough. We also need to pray in order to receive a personal witness of what is truth. By praying we keep the lines of communication open to our Heavenly Father as the sons of Mosiah had been doing as stated in verse 3.</p>
<p>"But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God." &nbsp; &nbsp; (Alma 17:3)<a href="#_edn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The young boy Joseph Smith who had been returning to the scriptures often to find answers found a life changing scripture that lead to the restoration of the gospel on the earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p>“But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering”. (James 1:5–6)<a href="#_edn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>If Joseph had only searched the scriptures and hadn’t asked through prayer having faith that his prayer would be answered we would all still be wondering which church to join. But Joseph did receive an answer in a big way. We don’t usually receive answers the way he did but I know personally prayers are answered and truth is confirmed if we ask in faith.</p>
<p>I kind of think of prayer as the cream of the gospel but since I am working on my wellness challenge and I am trying to make healthy choices I am going to compare it to non-fat milk for this story. For those that are lactose intolerant you can substitute soy or almond milk for your own analogy. I came back from the gym one morning ready to make and eat my oatmeal. I was looking forward to eating this as I hungry from my workout and I had cut up bananas and walnuts to put on top. In trying to hurry to get ready for work I grabbed it and started walking upstairs to finish getting ready. As I took a bite I thought, something is missing. I took another bite and thought this is bland. It was then that I discovered in my hurry I had completely forgotten the milk. I was surprised at what a difference it made. Now you can substitute any cereal you normally eat like Fruit Loops or Captain Crunch but you can understand that you need milk with your cereal. Or maybe you might like to compare it to eating an Oreo and not having milk to dunk it in. So I say to you “Don’t forget the milk” meaning don’t forget to pray. The gospel is so much more flavorful and delightful with your spiritual milk or prayer each day.</p>
<p>As in any software the programmer writes and designs the program to make life easier and helpful for us. As we compare this to our life we also have a programmer, it is Jesus Christ. He wrote a program to make life easier and help us return and be with Him again. One thing we are told about browser applications is don’t click on pop ups unless you know it is a reliable source but click on the “X” to dismiss it. I know of two things that can happen by clicking on a pop up. It can take you to a totally different site that is inappropriate or it can infect your computer with viruses. Let’s compare that to us and our lives. What are some of the pop ups in our lives? What viruses are making us sick? Could it be anger, hatred, inappropriate conduct and dishonesty? I could continue naming more but only you know the pop ups in your life. The programmer, Jesus Christ, wrote a program for us and it doesn’t include these pop ups but they will occur often in life so he has reminded us to “X” out of them. These pop ups happen sometimes when we search in the wrong place so we need to make sure the place we search is the right place. Are we searching in the right place? We need to make sure we are searching in the right place.</p>
<p>One of the parables that we can learn from is the parable of the prodigal son. Perhaps he was at home in the right place searching for ways to better his life. Perhaps he decided to take his inheritance and leave because he clicked on the pop up failing to heed the council of our Programmer to “X” out to stay safe and be protected. The pop up showed him a place that looked better than home and that was more appealing than the program that would help him to draw closer to our Father in Heaven. That pop up was a link placed by Satan enticing him with the things of the world making him think it was better on the other side. &nbsp;We can learn from him. As he got to the other side he came to realize that his new surroundings was not what he was looking for. &nbsp;So what did he do? &nbsp;He returned to the homepage where he began a new search in life. Often times we find ourselves in the wrong place and we fail to humble ourselves enough to return home. It might be to our earthly parents, it may be to our bishop or to our programmer, Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Please let us remember not to continue our life clicking on the pop-ups. Always remember to return to search. One of the greatest things of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that repentance is made available to all of us at any time. When you have a problem with a program you have an 800 number you can call 24 hours 7 days a week to get help. Sometimes you have a hard time understanding them because they may be from a foreign country but there is help. &nbsp;Our Savior’s call center is close by and always open. He is waiting for us to call and we can hear and understand Him because he speaks very clearly. Let us improve our lives. Remember to “X” out the pop ups.</p>
<p>Please let’s return to search for answers and for truth. Let’s not be deceived but grow strong in our testimonies of the gospel. We all want to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father so let us also return to humbleness to allow us to be taught truth, return to our church meetings if we have been missing in action, return to our patriarchal blessings to seek guidance and return to repentance to be worthy of His guidance. Be believing and have faith as you trust that you will receive an abundance of knowledge and blessings as you do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>April 5, 2016<br />Matthew S. Holland &amp; Paige B. Holland<br />President &amp; First Lady of Utah Valley University<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Sister Paige B. Holland:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha! What a wonderful treat to be with you today. Everything here is so beautiful: the beaches, the flowers, the lush green mountains, and, especially, all of you! Nothing on this magnificent island compares to you. Just by being here, looking the way you look, you tell me a lot about yourself and your character. Very few things are as inspiring as seeing young people making such great choices so early in life.</p>
<p>It is a lot like the feeling Matt and I had one day dealing with our youngest, Danny. He was four at the time. Every day, Danny would hang out with Ruby, his friend from next door. So one day, Matt, who is a bit of a tease, decided to confront Dan and Ruby. (Think of it as a kind of patriarchal “DTR moment.”) Catching them on their bikes, Matt jumped in front of Danny and said, rather sternly, “Danny, you and Ruby are sure spending a lot of time together.” &nbsp;Danny just kind of stared back at him in terror. Matt continued, “Are you two going to get married?” At this point, Danny no longer looked terrified but irritated and said, “Dad, we don’t even know the way to the temple.” Besides laughing hysterically, Matt and I found great joy in knowing that even as a little four year old, Danny was already fixing his sights on a temple marriage. The same could be said of our other children, namely our son Jake who is graduating from high school this year, and just got his mission call to Uruguay, and Mitzi and Grace, our adorable, volleyball-playing teenage daughters. We are delighted to have them with us here for a few days together on the island. Matt is insisting that I announce that this week, none of them are allowed to date.</p>
<p>Let me begin today by saying how much we love President and Sister Tanner and feel so greatly honored to be invited by them to speak to you today. They have been a powerful influence for good all across the Church and a great personal inspiration to both Matt and me since we were newly married. We have especially appreciated stories from their days of graduate school and early family life. &nbsp;In an effort to “pay it forward,” I would like to follow their example and share with you an experience we had in graduate school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall one afternoon where I was functioning on less than three hours of sleep because I had been up the night before with my new baby Mitzi who was sick. I was trying to dig out of a pile of laundry approaching the height of the Tower of Babel, when our two-year-old, Jacob, ran into our kitchen table and split his head wide open, right above his eye. I instantly knew we had to get to the hospital for stitches. I tried to reach Matt who was up on campus, but it was pre-cell phone days, and no one could find him. Since we had gone through roughly this same exercise six months prior to that with Jake, I knew it was going to be a very traumatic experience…for mother and son! Last time it had taken the strength of his father to help the hospital staff keep Jacob still so the doctor could perform the procedure. Now I wondered, how on earth could I pull this off alone? But I had no choice. I left my sick little baby Mitzi with a neighbor, and headed for the hospital with Jake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we pulled up, I asked him to fold his arms because we needed to say a prayer. What a touching sight it was for me to then look back in the rearview mirror and see Jake, open wound and all, fold his chubby little arms and shut his eyes super tight. (By the way, just so I don’t get in trouble, I will add that those chubby little arms are now the rock-solid “guns” of an outside linebacker!) In any case, at that moment I pled fervently with the Lord to bless Jake and help both of us get through this experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then went inside, checked in, and were sent to the dreaded waiting room. For two agonizing hours I sat there. As time wore on, so did my worries. I worried about my baby Mitzi being sick and hungry and needing her mother. I worried about my little Jakey having to be strapped in a restraining jacket to control the terror he would feel about getting stitches right around his eye. I wondered if Matt would get any of the messages I’d left with people on campus. I started to envision medical bills we could not afford, and weeks of constant attention to ensure proper healing. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding back my emotions I approached the receptionist to make sure we hadn’t been forgotten. Taped to her computer was a tattered little bookmark. In big, bold letters, it simply read, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” The instant I read this passage from Philippians 4:13,<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a> a sense of calm washed over me. &nbsp;I knew that heaven could get me through this, or any other experience, I was asked to face. And I knew this message was a direct answer to the prayer Jake and I said just a few hours earlier. Moments later and much to my relief, Matt walked through the door with baby Mitzi in his arms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We made it through that day…and we’ve made it through every day since. And while Matt’s arrival came as an answer to prayer, I learned that afternoon that even had I been asked to face that moment, or any other such moment, alone, I could have done that, too. Brothers and sisters, what Paul said to the Philippians is also true of you: you can do all things through Christ Who will strengthen you. No matter what task you are facing, if your life is one of basic righteousness, you can do it. God will come to you. He will bring you deliverance in your needed hour, or He will “strengthen [you so] that [you can] bear up [your] burdens with ease”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a>. I know. I have experienced such help again and again since I was your age. And, I know the God we can all trust. &nbsp;He lives to comfort you when faint. He lives to hear your soul's complaint. He lives to silence all your fears. He lives to wipe away your tears. He lives to calm your troubled heart. He lives all blessings to impart<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a>. I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><strong>President Matthew S. Holland:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, I am the luckiest man in the world to be married to Paige. In addition to being a constant source of comfort and inspiration, she brought me the greatest children in the world, Jake, Mitzi, Grace, and Dan get-me-to-the-temple-on-time-Holland.</p>
<p>I must echo Paige’s sentiment that we love and admire both of the Tanner’s so much. President Tanner has been especially influential in my professional life. Both as a scholar and a leader, he looks first, and so thoughtfully, to the gospel for his insights and direction. From graduate school to my current role as university administrator, I have been consciously trying to follow his example. It is an honor simply to be with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my office credenza at UVU in Orem, Utah, rest a few items of special meaning. First, there is a small replica of a proposed “Statue of Responsibility.” The concept here was inspired by renowned psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl, who argued that America should balance its Statue of Liberty on the East Coast with a complimentary Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast—a reminder that our country’s freedoms can only be enjoyed and preserved when buttressed by a healthy dose of individual and social responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my presidential mace. Adorned with a seal from each era of our institutional development, it is a wonderful reminder of the different historical phases of UVU. It is also made out of six distinct woods from the six different continents UVU students hail from. To make it a full seven, we are still looking for that transfer student from Antarctica. If there is a candidate here today, please see me afterwards for a full scholarship. I will also note that the mace comes in handy with disagreeable faculty.</p>
<p>Next to the mace is a jade ball. Actually, it is six jade balls, all amazingly carved from within the same block of jade. Besides being UVU green, it is a symbol of the kind of human ingenuity and careful craftsmanship I hope prevails in all intellectual and practical endeavors in higher education. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I have a waʻa kaulua. This was gifted to me by one of my Hawaiian students. In fact, she was my intern, and an outstanding one at that. She explained to me that this traditional, double-hulled canoe is a symbol of many things. It is a symbol of connectivity, overcoming the great divide of our globe: ocean and land. It is a symbol of faith, requiring its passengers to push out into an uncertain and often turbulent sea, controlling what they could control, trusting the rest to higher powers of mercy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most memorable to me, though, was her explanation that is a symbol of what I will call the “bountiful return.” Rarely if ever were these canoes used for journeys that would take its passengers to far-flung locations as a final destination. Rather, they were almost always used to take islanders out temporarily to gather food, forge alliances, or collect information, and then return to their home island to distribute these resources of sustenance, safety, and knowledge to their family, friends, and fellow villagers. The process of going out, gathering, and returning with bounty was repeated regularly in the life of the wa’a. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I keep this on my credenza, out of the many tokens that find their way to my office, is that, for me, this issue of the “bountiful return” is very much in line with the spirit of education. We leave hearth and home to take a class, earn a certificate, or graduate with a degree, then, with that newly-found knowledge, we return to our families, our jobs, our countries, much better able to make a productive contribution to those people and projects around us that matter the most.</p>
<p>Think of BYU Hawaii’s own I-WORK program, which, in the words of your website, specifically “encourages returnability.” You know the drill, the University helps defray the cost of education for certain students generally from South Pacific and the Far East who, among other things, agree to return to their home countries “to provide leadership roles in an international church, in civic and social affiliations, and within their families” (<a href="http://financialaid.byuh.edu/" target="_blank">financialaid.byuh.edu</a>). If this is not the spirit of waʻa kaulua, I don’t know what is. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also quite confident that University and Church leaders hope that it is not just the students on the I-WORK program who will follow this pattern. Long prophetic and presidential traditions on this campus make it very clear that one of the animating purposes of this institution is to produce myriads of students of the Asia-Pacific rim who will come here, learn, and go back to become figures of influence in their communities stretching from Kahuku to Korea. Even those of you not obligated by formal I-WORK agreement should consider the weight of this revelatory encouragement as you think about post-graduation plans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, such specific geographic returns are not required. Individual lives and missions are too varied and personal for that. But, at some level, the principle I am sharing here applies all students here. Remember, as far as I am concerned, the metaphor of the waʻa is even a powerful message for students in Orem, Utah, attending an Orem school, who plan to live and work and work in Orem when they are finished. Why is this so?</p>
<p>First, whoever you are, and wherever you come from, and wherever you end up after graduation, your education has never just been entirely about you. We now have, quite literally, reams of data showing that by virtue of graduating from college with a bachelor’s degree, you will, over a lifetime, likely earn $1.2 million more on average than someone without a degree. With a degree you are also much more likely to vote and volunteer, as well as avoid divorce, heart disease, clinical depression and time in prison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations! We are ecstatic that these rosy outcomes are now far more likely because you are here and determined to finish your degree. We want these things for you. But we also want more. Specifically, we want something from you. We want you to take your life of college-forged success and make a difference in the world. We want you to marry and have children and make sure they are raised in a condition of physical and spiritual security. Beyond that, whether you are serving on a local school board, running a corporation, or elected to high office, we want you to help your communities and countries flourish. Above all, we want you to use the skills and advantages of your college education to help build up the Kingdom of God, wherever you are. Millions—if not billions—of people are counting on you. The Book of Mormon is especially condemnatory of people who take for granted their “chances for learning” and then only worry about their own well-being and luxury<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the double-hulled canoe was made to go out and return regularly. This is true of your education as well. Now, after graduating from college, you might never again return to an institution of higher learning to earn an advanced degree. That’s okay. What is not okay is seeing your BYU-Hawaii experience as the end of your educational journey. A great university education should do more for you than just equip you with information and skills. Rather, it should fill you with a desire and an ability to be a lifelong learner. Once you leave here, I trust and hope that you will read regularly, attend lectures, take online courses, watch a biography, attend a conference, spend time with an expert, tackle a writing project. Remember, over the course of your life, you will be far more valuable to your families, your communities, and your businesses if you will take some time for yourself to engage with great literature, thoughtful commentary, cultural enrichment, and cutting-edge research. Especially after college, you must find ways to launch regularly out into the deep waters of learning, not to stay there forever, shirking your daily responsibilities of earning your keep and tending to the home fires, but so you can return to your careers, and your children, and your communities with additional light and power. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as you do so, remember that there is one area of study that should occupy your attention above all others, and that is the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and His chosen prophets. Once again, I turn to the traditional Hawaiian canoe to underscore the point.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most famous &nbsp;waʻa kaulua ever made is the Hokulea. It was built in the mid-1970’s in an effort to revitalize Hawaiian culture. The Hokulea’s most famous voyage was in 1976 when the canoe sailed all the way from Hawaii to Tahiti— more than 26-hundred miles—without using any motor or modern navigational instruments. The sailors did it the old-island or ancestral way. They used the stars.</p>
<p>The name of the boat is a tribute to the fact that the “guiding zenith star” for ancient Hawaiian mariners was called Hokulea. Known today as Arcturus, this star is the brightest in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere, and at Hawaii’s latitude, it passes directly overhead, thus making it possible for sailors to find the islands in the dark across the vast expanse of the Pacific. By fixing on that star, sailors were sure to be guided home, which brought them great gladness and joy. Thus it became known as Hokulea, meaning “Star of Gladness.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is not this precisely how we should see the Savior in our lives? Jesus Christ is the light of the world<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a>. More particularly, the scriptures refer to him in successive terms as “a Star”<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a>, “the day star”<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a>, &nbsp;“the morning star”<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a>, “the bright and morning star”<a href="#_edn9">[9]</a>, even the “Sun”—the S-U-N—“of Righteousness”<a href="#_edn10">[10]</a>. He is our best, brightest and truest guide. And, unlike the stars that guided ancient Polynesian sailors only after dark, His light comes shining in the day as well as the night. To the extent we ignore this guiding light, we are destined for the certain shipwreck of spiritual death and lasting sadness. Alternatively, following that light is the one fail safe way to find our way back home to Him and lasting happiness.</p>
<p>As the Psalmist says, “Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy”<a href="#_edn11">[11]</a>. Isaiah promises that all who seek and find redemption through the atonement of the Savior, will “come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away”<a href="#_edn12">[12]</a>. The great Russian novelist Dostoevsky was not a prophet, but I believe he captures a great truth through one his characters who exclaims, “In our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy”<a href="#_edn13">[13]</a>. And Joseph Smith, who was every inch a prophet, taught that “Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it”<a href="#_edn14">[14]</a>. Well, Jesus Christ is at once the path, and the singular source of light to guide us on that path. He is the ultimate Hokulea, or Star of Gladness, for all mankind and throughout all eternity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if you were listening closely, the gladness that is promised in Christ often seems to come after, or through, or in juxtaposition with some point of sadness or mourning. This is a sobering reality. I feel impressed to say that someone is sitting in this audience right now who is struggling with the fact that despite believing the gospel with all of your heart, and striving to live as best you can, you are not happy now. Instead, you are really quite sad, even down-right discouraged. I also feel impressed to say that if the person I have just described is not you, it just may be you at some point, or possibly several points, in your earthly journey. To my friend struggling today, and those who might struggle in the future, let me spend the remainder of our time together teaching one final principle. &nbsp;I will do so through the story of the Provo Tabernacle.</p>
<p>The old tabernacle in Provo was completed in 1898. It took years of sacrifice and effort to build it. Then, for more than a century, it stood as the ecclesiastical, communal, and cultural heart of Utah Valley, home to hundreds of thousands righteous Latter-day Saints. Blessed and dedicated for a mighty and sacred mission by George Q. Cannon, the tabernacle has received virtually every prophet of God from Lorenzo Snow to Thomas S. Monson to bear powerful testimony of the Savior. Even before it was dedicated, the tabernacle was put to sacred use by the Church, serving as home to General Conference in 1886 and 1887 when the Church was facing challenges with federal polygamy raids—the only time the Church has, since the move west, held its church-wide conference outside of Salt Lake City. This is to say nothing of the thousands of stake conferences held there for nearly a century and a half. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attended dozens of those conferences myself. Twice a year, for many years, both as a young boy and an adult, I climbed up the old spiral staircases to sit in the expansive balcony and be taught by inspired leaders. It was also the site of other memorable moments, like a regional cub scout essay contest, my seminary graduation, a moving patriotic service, sensational concerts of sacred and secular music, a heartwarming National Day of Prayer event, and more than one funeral of someone I loved and admired deeply. Like thousands of others in the Provo area, I absolutely treasured that building for its historic beauty and looming role in my spiritual and civic development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus it was nothing less than a personal and public tragedy when, during the night of December 16, 2010, the tabernacle caught on fire and was almost destroyed in its entirety. That evening, the tabernacle had been bustling with activity for the final rehearsal for a Christmas concert called Gloria, a musical retelling of the life of the Savior. With the hall filled with flowers, wreaths, and Christmas lights, many of the performers noted how magical everything felt, and how strong the Spirit was. In the days preparing for that moment, the composer, Lex de Azevedo said repeatedly how much he felt “God was supporting the endeavor”<a href="#_edn15">[15]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rehearsal proceeded that night, a light fixture left too close to a wooden speaker box in the attic continued to heat the wood until it ignited. Though alarms went off, the slow-smoldering fire tucked up in the attic went unnoticed, and the alarms were dismissed as false<a href="#_edn16">[16]</a>. Several other suspicious warnings were investigated through the night, but the fire was not discovered until 2:43 a.m. by a security guard. Within minutes firefighters were on the scene. But it was too late.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a full concert set in place, as well as its unique spiral staircases, exquisite hand-carved rostrum, scores of historic benches, and an attic chock-full of 130-year-old 2-by-10 trusses, the tabernacle was one gigantic tinderbox. &nbsp;Consequently, once this four-alarm fire got going, it burned so fiercely that arriving crews could not safely battle it from the inside. Instead, the best they could do was fight the flames from outside. Thus, they trained their hoses on the building’s gorgeous and beloved stained-glass windows, blasting them into shards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 4:30 a.m. hundreds had gathered at a safe distance, watching in grief. Many were openly weeping. By 8 o’clock, the roof had caved in, and virtually everything on the inside steadily burned into a pile of charred rubble and ashes. Ultimately, all that remained was the historic structure’s brick shell.</p>
<p>Immediately, the community was awash in grief and confusion. I confess, I was too. How could this happen? Wasn’t this a good building, even a great building—dedicated and blessed for protection? Why would the Lord let this happen? And why now? It was Christmas! And a tireless and devoted cast was ready to perform their hearts out there in a musical tribute to the Savior for hundreds of guests. Why on earth would heaven have not protected this divine edifice at this moment of all moments?</p>
<p>It did not make much sense to any of us, including Buddy Richards, the stake president who oversaw the geographic area of Provo’s Tabernacle Square. The morning of the fire, Buddy was among the emotional masses who came to watch and grieve over the tabernacle’s smoldering embers. He was just incredulous. It all just seemed so wrong. With his heart breaking, he walked around the perimeter of the building asking himself, over and over, how could this have happened? &nbsp;And, then, looking through one of the blown-out windows, he saw something that caught his eye and stopped him in his tracks. Resting on a pile of debris was a painting. &nbsp;Around the edges, it was charred to a crisp like every other solitary thing in that building that wasn’t completely incinerated. But what was preserved, traced out almost to a “T,” in seemingly miraculous fashion, was the unburned image of the Savior. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As he sat there, thunderstruck over how miraculously preserved this image of the Savior seemed to be, having rested on a wall that was now nothing but a pile of burnt rubble he felt as if he was being drawn into a conversation with the Lord. Suddenly, in his mind’s eye, he was picturing the Savior addressing him saying, “Buddy, do you know whose house this is?” President Richards then heard himself saying, “Yes, it is Your house.” To which the Lord responded, “Then what business is it of yours if I want to remodel it?”</p>
<p>What President Richards got by impression early on, though only “through a glass, darkly”<a href="#_edn17">[17]</a> was something President Thomas S. Monson brought out in big, bold, prophetic relief, eight months later at General Conference:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Late last year the Provo Tabernacle in Utah County was seriously damaged by a terrible fire. This wonderful building, much beloved by generations of Latter-day Saints, was left with only the exterior walls standing. After careful study, we have decided to rebuild it with full preservation and restoration of the exterior, to become the second temple of the Church in the city of Provo”<a href="#_edn18">[18]</a>.</p>
<p>Did you hear the audience gasp? I remember the moment so well. I was one of the &nbsp;gaspers. In fact, I was a gasper who quickly dissolved into a bawler. With tears streaming down my cheeks, all of my questions here were fully and finally answered. The tabernacle had not been cast off and ruined forever. No, in a most startling way, it was being transformed into something even greater and more glorious. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Within weeks of President Monson’s announcement, a monumental effort got underway. Other nearby buildings were purchased and demolished. An adjacent underground parking lot and block of city street were acquired. An internal scaffolding was erected and shotcrete applied to shore up the strength of the tenuous brick walls. Most striking of all, the foundation was dug out and cleared away, while the newly shored-up brick walls, weighing roughly seven-million pounds, were, in a feat of engineering genius, suspended on 40-foot-high stilts made of steel without shifting an inch to the left or right. This allowed for a far stronger and more expansive substructure to be put in place—providing new earthquake resistant foundations, two levels of underground flooring, and a massively extended parking lot. Concrete walls were then poured where old wooden wall used to stand. And when a new massive steel beam skeletal structure for the whole building was added to that, a stunning new central tower was added to the roof—something that was part of the old tabernacle when it was first built, but had to later be removed for safety reasons. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Other finishing touches included new grand and spiral staircases that rose far higher and more ornately than anything previously in the tabernacle, new stained glass in beautiful pastels of gold and green, deep woven rugs and dark rich woods, in rooms with vaulted ceilings and soaring gothic arches throughout. On the outside, lush flower gardens, trees, walkways, and a Victorian pavilion with a fountain and gazebo. The picture is one of utter and complete transformation, inside and out.</p>
<p>Consider the building’s new-found reach. In the two weeks preceding the dedication, an estimated 841,000 individuals came to view this spectacular new structure—an audience vastly larger than was set to attend the Christmas concert the fateful night of the fire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six years ago, the flames that ravaged the Provo Tabernacle appeared to have ruined—if not completely destroyed forever—one of the loveliest and best things in all of Utah Valley. But just the opposite was true. Those flames were purifying and preparing the tabernacle for something even more extraordinary. Ultimately, the tabernacle was intended for a much grander, even celestial purpose. Well, brothers and sisters, so are you!</p>
<p>This principle has been captured neatly by that great, inspired Anglican intellectual, C.S. Lewis who said:</p>
<p>“Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of—throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself”<a href="#_edn19">[19]</a>.</p>
<p>If you are feeling broken down and beaten this morning by a debilitating disease or death of someone close, a grievous sin or gross injustice, a case of bad judgment or an unexpected rejection by the love of your life, or any one of a host of things agonizing or tragic, do not despair! No matter what has happened to you, hold on! In fact, be of good cheer, for this thing will work for your good, as “all things” do for those who love the Lord. The Lord has declared, “Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction”<a href="#_edn20">[20]</a>. Yet, the same Lord who may occasionally subject you to the refiner’s fire is the same Lord who will pull you through on the other end, strengthened, purified, beautified, and joyful, deeply, supremely, and eternally joyful.</p>
<p>As George Q. Cannon, who dedicated the Provo Tabernacle, and whose namesake is on this building we sit in today, once put it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our God can be trusted to the very uttermost. No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction, He will never desert us. He never has, he never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character. He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and he will be the same throughout the ages to come… We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep his commandments”<a href="#_edn21">[21]</a>.</p>
<p>To all of you dear young brothers and sisters, but especially those of you who awoke this morning feeling wrecked and ruined, or weeping over some fiery furnace of affliction moment, my message to you is this: turn to that great and glorious Star of Gladness, the Savior of mankind, and be glad yourself. Be glad because “He lives, and loves you to the end”<a href="#_edn22">[22]</a>. Be glad because His greatest desire and animating aim is to bring you to the point that you might share in every good thing He has, every richness, every glory, every joy. The Star of Gladness is fashioning you into a star of gladness. I know that this is your true destiny. You are made to be happy. And, you will be happy to the extent that you fix your gaze and chart your course by the incomparably brilliant and loving light of the Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that with Christ as your shining zenith Star, the darkest days of burning, bereavement, and burden, simply cannot last. Without fail, you will be given “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, [and] the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.”<a href="#_edn23">[23]</a> This is your promise and your potential. I so testify of these things in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>March 29, 2016<br />Elder Yoon Hwan Choi &amp; Sister Bon Koo Choi<br />General Authority Seventy, Second Counselor in the Asia North Area Presidency<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, Aloha! &nbsp;</p>
<p>What a great honor for us to come to Brigham Young University-Hawaii. Thirty-two years ago, Sister Choi and I were students here. We developed our academic skills, nourished and strengthened our family, and were trained on this very campus to lead and build Zion. It was the perfect place for us, as a young family, to learn how to read Heavenly Father’s mind and apply His will in our daily lives. This campus is a holy place and it is our home of “Aloha.” Let me share what we have learned throughout the years regarding the ability to “Read His Mind, Do His Will.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Find His Will</span></strong></p>
<p>From the beginning of my conversion, I learned how to choose the will of the Lord through trials and challenges. I joined the Church with my family when I was 16 years old. Three months after my conversion, my bishop, Cha Bong Kim, asked me if I could speak at stake conference. I was honored to be assigned to share my testimony in a stake conference. I said “yes” immediately, although I was a little nervous. However, it was a big challenge for me to accept that invitation after I heard what the topic of my talk was to be: &nbsp;How to Prepare for My Mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>From the age of a young boy, Elder Choi dreamed of becoming a general in the Army and prepared in many ways, including physical strength and academic courses, to be able to pass the entrance exam for the military academy. &nbsp;After he joined the Church, he learned that missionary work was a duty for all young men; but it was not the first priority for a recent convert. He would have had to abandon his lifetime dream in order to serve a mission because, in Korea, to be excused from the military academy for any reason was not possible. He told the bishop that he could not speak on that topic at the stake conference because he could not give up his dream. Although Bishop Kim knew what his plan was, he asked him to pray about it for a week and then talk to him again. During the next week this young Elder Choi prayed and listened for an answer, asking Heavenly Father if he should prepare for a mission, striving to gain a testimony regarding the matter so he would be able to speak at the stake conference. He prayed and prayed and prayed every night and every day. In spite of praying for a whole week, he could not change his mind because he could not imagine his future in any way except as a military career. His worldly desire was stronger than his focus on the will of the Lord. He went back to the bishop and said he could not speak at the stake conference unless the topic assigned to him was changed. The bishop kindly told him that he would ask another young man to speak instead. However, Elder Choi was very uncomfortable with this decision because, for the first time, he did not obey his bishop. This unwillingness to accept an assignment was very hard for him. After that time, whenever he thought about a fulltime mission, he felt that his mind was confused and his life was complicated. The situation continued to bother him to the extent that it adversely affected his life, not only as a member of the Church, but in his school work, as well. He was neither happy nor content. He was reminded again and again that a fulltime mission was the duty of all young men. About three months later, as he became more humble, he sought the will of the Lord and the ability to change his mind regarding his chosen career. Finally, he committed to serve the Lord for two years and promised himself that his rejection of the bishop’s invitation to speak in stake conference would be the last time for the rest of his life that he would decline to accept a church assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>When I was 19 years old I was called to serve in the Korea Busan Mission. It was a glorious time. Unfortunately, my mission was interrupted by the call to serve my country. Military service is mandatory for all Korean young men and we are required to join the army once we have been called by our country to do so. Therefore, I needed to be released from my mission after one year and serve my country for three years. After I finished this three-year assignment in the military, I wanted to serve a mission again, although I was honorably released from my mission. However, many people, including my parents, told me that I didn’t have to serve a mission again because I was honorably released in order to serve my country for three years. They said that was enough. That sounded okay to me and I started thinking about my future as I continued to seek the will of the Lord. Later, when I had a chance to visit with Sister Choi, who was a member of my ward and a good friend of mine, I asked her opinion about my going on a second mission. Surprisingly, her answer was not the same as others. She was the only one who thought differently about another mission and about me. She said,&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>“I know who Brother Choi is. He is the one who will serve another mission.”</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>What a great compliment and confirmation for me! She had high expectations for me and this helped me have the desire to elevate my thoughts more completely to find the will of the Lord. I recognized my loyalty was to the Lord and was so happy to get her support for a second mission. I turned in my missionary papers again and was called to serve in the Korea Seoul Mission for one year, a mission location different from my first mission. I learned that to find and do the will of the Lord is simple when we humble ourselves sufficiently to elevate our thoughts and read His mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We read in Isaiah 55:8-9, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts."<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a> However, a way to read His mind is available to us. In Jacob 4:8 we read, “Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.”<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a> Let us heed the words, “Save it be revealed unto him.” Heavenly Father reveals His mind and His will to men when we elevate our thoughts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Look Up</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>One time when Elder Choi was a young father and a student here, and we were living in Temple View Apartments (TVA), he had an overwhelming day after discovering we had no money left in our bank account. He was the head of our family, making less money than we needed, facing bills that were due, being weighed down with schoolwork and exams as a full-time student, and lacking sleep because of our new-born baby. He could not find a solution to our financial difficulties and was unable to focus on school work. He found no joy that troubling day and struggled to find the faith he needed. Amid doubt and fear, he spent a sleepless night.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>I went out to walk alone in the middle of the night. I did not know where to go but just wanted to be away from TVA for a time. I walked and walked, carrying all these concerns in my heart and heavy burdens on my shoulders. I did not know how long I walked but at last I found myself walking towards the light of the Laie Hawaii Temple. The temple was so bright and beautiful when everywhere else was dark. The light of the temple led me to look up rather than at the dark world around me. As I continued to look up, I saw the beautiful stars in the sky. At that moment I realized, like the stars in the sky, I could not count the blessings I had received. Suddenly, those blessings were clear to me. Heavenly Father had given me a beautiful wife and precious boys. I was studying in the Lord’s school where many instructors were teaching, not only academic subjects, but lessons of daily life in the gospel; and I had made many friends at this school. I realized how many times I had seen the hand of the Lord in my life, especially during those times when I could not find a solution. When I realized how much I had been blessed, I felt that I needed to return home immediately. I ran to our apartment at TVA. Sister Choi was praying for me because I left home without telling her anything. I hugged her, apologized to her, and shared what I learned when I looked up at the temple and the heavens. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>We counted the blessings again that we had received and refreshed our faith. This faith brought us hope and the confidence to manage all things. The same challenges were no longer heavy. We concluded that we could never find the answers to our challenges from the world, but we could always find the answers from the Lord. We decided to focus on the spiritual things more than ever before. To look around the world and be confused was easy, but to look up to Heaven and be happy was also easy. When we look up, we can have faith to trust in Him. With faith, we can read His mind and do His will. This was a great lesson in humility for us in our early married life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doubt Not, Fear Not</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>I applied for several jobs in Korea before I finished my master’s program because I planned to go back home as soon as I finished my education in the United States. Although I was asked to be ready for interviews from some good companies in the computer field, I had no final offers before we left the United States. Many people said how silly I was, as the head of my family, going back to my home country without any money or job. Many people did not go back home after finishing their education. We were going back, anyway. The choice was not difficult for me because I felt, even before becoming a student that I needed to return to Korea once I completed my education. That feeling was confirmed during my new-student orientation at BYU-Hawaii, where I understood clearly that we would need to go back home to serve our home country and to strengthen the kingdom of the Lord, in accordance with the counsel of the prophet, Harold B. Lee, in his General Conference address on April 6, 1973, entitled “Strengthen the Stakes of Zion”.<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Yes, I had great fear to go back home without money, home, or job. I doubted whether or not I was making the right decision when I thought about those worries. In addition, I found many opportunities and excuses to stay in the United States. Fortunately, my faith to do the will of the Lord was stronger than my fear and doubt. The Lord said, “Look unto me in every thought. Doubt not, fear not.” (D&amp;C 6:36)<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>As Elder Choi mentioned, we did not have money. We did not have our own home when we went back to Korea. We started living with his parents. We thought he would be hired in a short time, but all his job applications were rejected. He had more than twenty interviews, but all ended up for nothing. He could not find a job for two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>I was patient and faithful until then, but it was hard to be patient anymore because I expected to find employment easily and quickly with my credentials. I was very disappointed, hung my head with shame, and started doubting myself. “What did I do wrong? Is this the result of listening to the words of the prophet? Should I have stayed in the United States to look for a job there? It would have been easier to find a job there. What shall I do to support my family? How can I take care of my wife and my two little children? My friends who told me to stay in the States will laugh at me. Does this mean I should go back to the States?” I couldn’t find the answer at all and thus I was not happy for a while. In spite of that difficult time, I did not miss a single day to pray, to study the scriptures, and to hold weekly family home evening. As I did these basic things, I found the energy to push myself to continue to be faithful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day I went to the Church Distribution Center to buy a book and met a senior missionary couple. We introduced ourselves to each other and they learned that I was looking for a job. They said they had a friend who was the general manager for Data General Korea and he was looking for a manager. Data General was an American computer company opening an office in Korea. After two months of rejection and waiting, I was so humbled that I told them I did not have any work experience except part-time jobs on the university campus. I meant I was not qualified for the position he was trying to fill. They said, “Let’s see if there’s any other position.” I received contact information and called the general manager in Korea that day. He wanted to see me the next day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I interviewed with him, he said he was looking for a person exactly like me who knew the cultures of both America and Korea. He was looking for someone who could be a bridge between headquarters in Boston and New York in the United States and the Seoul Korea office. I told him I did not have enough experience, but I would work hard and do my best. When he asked me how much I wanted to be paid, I submitted the least amount and told him I did not mind how much. He said, “Do not underestimate yourself. You studied hard and you are qualified enough for this position. I found a diamond in the rough.” He then offered me a salary that was double the amount I would have gotten from any of those companies that had rejected me during the previous two months. I also received more benefits with better working conditions to spend more time with my family and church responsibilities. I repented for not being patient during this process of learning how to be more humble. Soon, I was called as the Young Men’s president in my ward and became a young bishop one year later. My job at Data General was the perfect job for me to fulfill the needs of my family and my church assignments. This job was the blessing and the reward for my decision to listen to the will of Heavenly Father and return to my home country. He prepared the best job for me, but I didn’t know His plan for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our living prophets still invite us to gather to Zion. President Russell M. Nelson said, “The choice to come unto Christ is not a matter of physical location; it is a matter of individual commitment. . . . The Lord has decreed the establishment of Zion in each realm where He has given His Saints their birth and nationality. Scripture foretells that the people ‘shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.’(2 Nephi 9:2) Every nation is the gathering place for its own people. The place of gathering for Brazilian Saints is in Brazil; the place of gathering for Nigerian Saints is in Nigeria; the place of gathering for Korean Saints is in Korea; and so forth.” (Ensign, November 2006 “The Gathering of Scattered Israel”)<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>As we listened to the promptings of the Lord and relied on the words of the prophets, we were led to return to our homeland. However, at times some of us may feel inclined to look for information from social media or other sources rather than rely on these dependable sources. In the last General Conference, President Uchtdorf mentioned a situation in which he went to the internet with medical questions to find more satisfactory answers than those he had already received from his doctor. He said, “Of course, researching things for ourselves is not a bad idea. But I was disregarding truth I could rely on and instead found myself being drawn to the often-outlandish claims of Internet lore.” (President Uchtdorf, October 2015 General Conference “It Works Wonderfully!”)<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a> Brothers and Sisters, let us listen to the voice of the prophets. Let us not disregard truth. Let us rely on the words of God. That is the way we can read His mind and do His will without fear and doubt. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Christ’s Example</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>Jesus Christ showed us how to read Heavenly Father’s mind and how to do His will. He prayed constantly and sincerely to His Father in order to know His Father’s mind. He prayed, “Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.” (Luke 22:42)<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>May we all pray constantly and sincerely in order to read His mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>His life was filled with doing His Father’s will. He said, “I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will” (D&amp;C 19:24).<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a></p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>May we all fill our lives with doing His will as Jesus Christ did. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>He knew He was doing the right things because he sought the will of the Father. He said, “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. (John 5:30)”.<a href="#_edn9">[9]</a></p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>May we all know we are doing the right things by seeking only His will.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>After He was resurrected, Jesus Christ could tell the world, “. . . I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things . . . (3 Nephi 11:11)”.<a href="#_edn10">[10]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>May we all glorify our Heavenly Father by suffering His will in all things. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blessings</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>As you heard, blessings are promised when we find the will of the Lord and do His will. We may say BYU-HAWAII is just a small university on this hot and humid island with no air-conditioner in any Hale or TVA, foreign students cannot exceed 19 hours of work each week, and we hear more than 60 different accents of English. On the other hand, you may talk about the same school differently when you read the Lord’s mind. Because of the size of the school, you have very close relationships between teachers and students. It is easy to make friends because you see them almost every day. You can make friends from over 70 different countries, and even foreigners can get a job and work legally on campus or at the Polynesian Cultural Center. At least each classroom has cool air, sometimes too cool to stay without an extra jacket. You are not the only one who has a weird English accent. Do you see the difference? When we read Heavenly Father’s mind, we understand that “. . . [H]e who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more” (Doctrine and Covenants 78:19).<a href="#_edn11">[11]</a> What a big difference when you read His mind and see things as He sees them! What would you choose?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>This school was built to bless each one of you, especially foreign students like us. &nbsp;In his inauguration remarks on November 10, 2015, President John S. Tanner stated, “. . . I see a school that takes special care of the academic orphan and stranger in the land. &nbsp;I see a school that serves an alma mater (meaning a ‘nourishing mother’) for its students, especially for students who are poor, late bloomers, first-generation, international, non-native English speakers.” Sister Choi and I were also poor, late bloomers, first generation, international, non-native English speakers. We came here with almost nothing, but we were blessed to be able to finish our education without any debt. In this school we learned the things the Lord wanted us to know, prepared ourselves to be a righteous father and mother, to be leaders in the Church and the community, and to build and strengthen Zion in the land of our inheritance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Choi:</strong></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Heavenly Father sent us here because He loves us. His mind is full of love for us. He wants us to return to Him and to be like Him. When you find the will of the Lord, you will elevate your thoughts to see yourself as the Lord sees you. When you look up, you will have hope and you will find the faith to do what He wants you to do. You will want to do His will because you love Him. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elder Choi:</strong></p>
<p>President Uchtdorf said, "Oh, how we need to love God! For what we love determines what we seek. What we seek determines what we think and do. What we think and do determines who we are—and who we will become." (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, October 2009 General Conference "The Love of God")<a href="#_edn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Read His Mind, Do His Will. Remember the words of King Benjamin, “. . . [T]he Mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view” (Mosiah 2:9).<a href="#_edn13">[13]</a> I bear a special witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ who is a perfect example of one who does the will of the Father. He is our Savior and His redemption is real. His atonement works for all mankind as we humble ourselves, turn our hearts to him, and follow in his footsteps. Heavenly Father loves all of us as His precious children. Although we each have our own desires of what we want to accomplish in the world, I promise that we will be richly blessed by listening to His guidance and following His way, which is the only way to live with Him again someday. Let us read His mind and do His will. We love you and admire you for all the things you are doing according to the will of the Lord. &nbsp;I bless you and pray for you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>March 22, 2016<br />Chad H Webb<br />Administrator of Seminaries &amp; Institutes of Religion<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>I am very grateful to be with you wonderful students on this beautiful campus. Thank you for coming so prepared to learn.</p>
<p>I want to begin by sharing with you a story that was told of a baseball team. This baseball team had a manager who thought that if his players took turns playing all the positions, they would become a better team. So, during one game the manager called time out, walked onto the field, and told the third baseman and the first baseman to switch positions. The problem in this instance was that the third baseman had never played anything but third base. From the time he was a child, he had practiced scooping up ground balls and throwing them across the field to first base. And now he was playing in a professional game in a large stadium with a lot of fans and a lot of pressure, and he was asked to play a position he had never played.</p>
<p>The next hitter was a large, left-handed batter who hit a scorching ground ball to the newly appointed first baseman. The player’s years of experience kicked into gear, and he easily reached down and scooped up the ground ball. But reacting more than thinking, he raised his arm to throw the ball across the field—not remembering that first base was just a few steps away. As he did this, the runner, whose only option was to run to first base, stopped immediately in his tracks, thinking that the first baseman was about to throw the ball at him.</p>
<p>Everyone started yelling to the first baseman to just touch first base. But in all the confusion and noise, this young player was not thinking clearly. So when he saw the catcher throw off his mask and raise his arms, yelling something that he couldn’t understand, the first baseman decided to throw the ball to the catcher.</p>
<p>Now the runner was confused because the catcher and the first baseman began throwing the ball back and forth to each other. Even though a runner cannot return to home plate, he was trying not to be tagged out. So he made a break for the first open base he thought he could reach safely—home plate. As he dived into home, the catcher caught the ball and tagged him.</p>
<p>The umpire yelled, “You’re out!”</p>
<p>The catcher turned to the umpire and asked, “And what if he had been safe?”</p>
<p>It’s kind of an odd story. Those who understand baseball know that the first baseman should have clearly known what to do, and the runner should have known as well. But in all the noise and chaos, what seems so obvious and simple became very confusing.</p>
<p>At times we may feel like these baseball players and find it difficult to cut through all the noise and confusion in the world around us and recognize the simple truth.</p>
<p>Think about how well Lehi’s vision describes this challenge. In his dream, there were some who made it to the tree and stayed faithful. But there were others who were confused by the mist or drawn away by the numerous enticing and persuasive voices of those in the great and spacious building. These individuals ended up being drowned in the depths of the river or lost in strange and forbidden paths. Some even arrived at the tree and experienced the joy of partaking of the fruit, but they were later ashamed and wandered off.<a href="#_edn1">[i]</a></p>
<p>So here’s my question: Why does it sometimes seem so difficult to find and hold on to truth?</p>
<p>For some it may be that they simply do not know where to find truth.<a href="#_edn2">[ii]</a>&nbsp;Others, like the baseball players and those in Lehi’s vision, may be confused by all the voices. In a world that values the tolerance and acceptance of any type of behavior, we may feel embarrassed to speak up for or to live what we believe to be true. And if we begin to fear others and regard their opinions more than the Lord’s commandments, it can create a mist that blinds us from the eternal realities of our Father in Heaven and His gospel.</p>
<p>For others it may be difficult to find and hold on to truth because they want to rely on their own reasoning and logic rather than turn to the Lord. Pride may lead us to care more about being right than knowing and choosing the right. Or we may become complacent, thinking that all is well in Zion,<a href="#_edn3">[iii]</a>&nbsp;and simply wander away. We may stop doing the basic things that gave us a testimony in the first place and then wake up one day surprised by how far from the strait and narrow path we have strayed. For others it may be difficult because the “wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, . . . and because of the tradition of their fathers.”<a href="#_edn4">[iv]</a>&nbsp;For all of these reasons and more, President Henry B. Eyring said, “We live in a time when even the wisest will be hard-pressed to distinguish truth from clever deception.” <a href="#_edn5">[v]</a></p>
<p>All of this opposition can be discouraging. But there is hope. This is our Heavenly Father’s world and, as His children, we are living through His plan. We can trust Him completely, relying on His wisdom, His love, and His power to help us. He knows all things and is the source of all truth.<a href="#_edn6">[vi]</a>&nbsp;He has promised to reveal truth to our minds and hearts through the Holy Ghost if we will diligently seek Him.<a href="#_edn7">[vii]</a>&nbsp;Nephi highlighted the eternal significance of this idea when he prophesied: “Wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.”<a href="#_edn8">[viii]</a>&nbsp;That is why our quest for truth is essential in our quest for eternal life. If we do not know God’s doctrine, if we do not understand and follow divine, eternal truth, we cannot know how to come to Him to be saved and redeemed.</p>
<p>To that end, the Lord has established divinely ordained patterns and has revealed the principles and conditions upon which we can come to know Him and by which we can learn eternal truth. We might be tempted to think that we can set the terms and conditions. But it has always been the Lord who determines what we must do to come to know the things of the Spirit. He requires that we have an earnest desire to know the truth<a href="#_edn9">[iv]</a>&nbsp;and that we are willing to follow it.<a href="#_edn10">[x]</a>&nbsp;Acquiring spiritual knowledge often requires, as it did for Enos, that we wrestle before God, that our soul hungers, and that we call out in mighty prayer.<a href="#_edn11">[xi]</a> It will require that we not only search the scriptures but that we search diligently.<a href="#_edn12">[xii]&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>But even after having put forth this effort, there may be times when we discover new information that seems difficult to understand or when we have questions regarding the doctrine, practices, or history of the Church that seem difficult to answer. This might happen when we come across new information during our personal study, or it might happen when someone challenges our faith. Whatever the reason, there will be times when we each have questions. May I suggest four principles that can bless and help you during these crucial occasions?</p>
<p>Number one: The attitude and intent with which we ask questions will greatly affect our ability to learn from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Asking questions and seeking answers is a vital part of our effort to learn truth. Inspired questions should be considered gifts from God that provide opportunities for us to increase our understanding and to draw closer to Him. The scriptures and Church history are full of examples. The First Vision came in response to a question. Many sections in the Doctrine and Covenants are evidence that the Lord teaches us when we study, ponder, pray, and ask inspired questions.</p>
<p>One example is recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 138. Due to world events such as World War I and an influenza epidemic, and after the personal and tragic loss of several of his children, President Joseph F. Smith longed to better understand the condition of spirits that leave this earth. With that question pressing on his heart and mind, he turned to the scriptures for answers. President Smith explained:</p>
<p>“As I pondered over [the scriptures], the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.”<a href="#_edn13">[xiii]</a></p>
<p>This remarkable revelation was given because of President Smith’s willingness to pray and to study and because he had a burning question.</p>
<p>The scriptures also show us that the intent of our questions will greatly influence our ability to learn and understand the things of the Spirit. To illustrate, as Alma and Amulek were teaching the people of Ammonihah, many of the people, including a man named Zeezrom, began to ask them questions. Listen to how the scriptures describe their questions and the reasons for their questions:</p>
<p>“There were some among them who thought to question [Alma and Amulek], that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them. . . .</p>
<p>“And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma.”<a href="#_edn14">[xiv]</a></p>
<p>In other words, the intent of their questions was to entrap, to find fault, and to accuse.</p>
<p>When Zeezrom was later converted to the gospel, he still had questions. But notice how his intent changed:</p>
<p>“Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God [and] the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead . . . to stand before God to be judged.”<a href="#_edn15">[xv]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, rather than asking questions to criticize, Zeezrom began asking questions because he really wanted to learn. He had heard of the judgment day, and he wanted to prepare himself. He began to humbly ask questions because he wanted to know and follow eternal truth. Our attitude and intent will also have much to do with our own ability to learn the things the Lord would like to teach us.</p>
<p>The second principle: When we turn to the Lord in faith, holding fast to what we already know to be true, additional spiritual knowledge and understanding will come.</p>
<p>We act in faith when we choose to trust God and turn to Him first in our efforts to acquire and understand spiritual knowledge. We act in faith as we keep His commandments and watch for evidence of His promised blessings. Acting in faith includes doing those things that will invite the Spirit as we search for further understanding. Elder M. Russell Ballard shared this example:</p>
<p>“One of our outstanding missionaries that served with us in the Canada Toronto Mission years ago came to my office in Salt Lake City. During our visit, he told me that he was losing his faith and his testimony and that he had many questions. I asked him to write down his questions and promised to find answers to them, certainly as many as I could. As he was about to leave . . . I said, ‘Elder, how long has it been since you have studied the scriptures; specifically, how long has it been since you have read from the Book of Mormon?’ He lowered his head and said he had not been doing that. I gave him an assignment to begin reading the Book of Mormon for an hour each day while I worked to prepare answers to his questions. He agreed to do so.</p>
<p>“Two weeks later, he came back to my office, and as he entered in and sat down he said, ‘President, I don’t need answers to those questions anymore. I did what you asked—I know the Book of Mormon is true and I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.’ I was very happy to hear that but said, ‘Elder, I spent a long time answering your questions so you will have to sit down and hear the answers!’ What a joy! The Spirit and light of the gospel had returned to him. I commended him and gave him a big hug before he left.”<a href="#_edn16">[xvi]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we act in faith through study, prayer, and obedience, we invite the Holy Ghost to dispel uncertainty and to reaffirm the testimony we have already been given of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:</p>
<p>“In moments of fear or doubt or troubling times, hold the ground you have already won, even if that ground is limited. . . . When those moments come and issues surface, the resolution of which is not immediately forthcoming, hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes. . . . The size of your faith or the degree of your knowledge is not the issue—it is the integrity you demonstrate toward the faith you do have and the truth you already know.</p>
<p>“. . . I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I am asking you to be true to the faith you do have. . . . Be as candid about your questions as you need to be; life is full of them on one subject or another. But if you and your family want to be healed, don’t let those questions stand in the way of faith working its miracle.”<a href="#_edn17">[xvii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Heavenly Father has revealed all that is necessary for our salvation, He has not yet revealed all truth. As we continue to seek for answers, we must live by faith.<a href="#_edn18">[xviii]</a>&nbsp;The Lord has promised that as we are faithful, He will give us additional light, knowledge, and truth, “line upon line, precept upon precept.”<a href="#_edn19">[xix]</a></p>
<p>There is an interesting example in the history of the Church that illustrates the difference between doubting—which often leads to darkness and uncertainty—and patient and intelligent inquiry—which leads to understanding and spiritual confirmation. When the Prophet Joseph Smith received the vision concerning the three degrees of glory, which is in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, many members of the Church, including Brigham Young, initially had a difficult time accepting it as a revelation from the Lord because it departed significantly from the mainstream Christian view of one heaven and one hell. However, listen to how Brigham chose to respond: “My traditions were such, that when the Vision came first to me, it was so directly contrary and opposite to my former education, I said, wait a little, I did not reject it, but I could not understand it.”<a href="#_edn20">[xx]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brigham decided to exercise patience, to pray, to ponder, and to seek clarification from the prophet. But while he sought further understanding, he did not let go of what he had come to love in the restored gospel.<a href="#_edn21">[xxi]</a>&nbsp;And soon, he obtained his own witness from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Letting go of our blessings in the Church because of an unanswered question would be like the person who visited Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, in the springtime. As he walked through the grounds, enjoying the countless beautiful flowers, he noticed a weed. It bothered him that in such a scenic place, with thousands of stunning flowers, someone had failed to pull one particular weed. The rest of the day, his focus remained on the weed and he completely forgot about all the beautiful flowers that had previously given him so much joy.</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once asked:</p>
<p>“What conceivable historical or doctrinal or procedural issue that may arise among any group could ever overshadow or negate one’s consuming spiritual conviction regarding the Father’s merciful plan of salvation; His Only Begotten Son’s birth, mission, Atonement, and Resurrection; the reality of the First Vision; the restoration of the priesthood; the receipt of divine revelation, both personally and institutionally; the soul-shaping spirit and moving power of the Book of Mormon; the awe and majesty of the temple endowment; one’s own personal experience with true miracles; and on and on and on? Talk about a question! It is a mystery to me how those majestic, eternal, first-level truths so central to the grandeur of the whole gospel message can be set aside or completely dismissed by some in favor of obsessing over second- or third- or fourth-level pieces of that whole.”<a href="#_edn22">[xxii]&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>To protect ourselves from this tragic mistake, we cannot become embarrassed, distracted, prideful, or even just casual in our private religious observance and devotion. The cost is too great. Remaining steadfast in our spiritual conviction of the “majestic, eternal, first-level truths” mentioned by Elder Holland brings blessings that simply cannot be replaced by anything the world has to offer. For me, these truths are the pillars of my testimony and faith. They are the things I have learned through the Holy Ghost and have come to love. They have connected me to heaven. And I know that God knows what He has taught me, and I cannot deny it or turn away from it.<a href="#_edn23">[xxiii]</a></p>
<p>I know that many of you have had similar experiences with learning through the Holy Ghost. I know that you are faithfully holding on to what you know to be true. Thank you for standing for truth—always with kindness and compassion, but faithfully standing for truth. When you do, you may feel that you are alone, but you are not. When you stand for truth, you stand with the Lord and with His prophets.</p>
<p>Principle number three: As we examine concepts and questions with an eternal perspective, we are better able to cut through the confusion and recognize eternal truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we examine doctrinal concepts, questions, and social issues with an eternal perspective, we consider them in the context of the plan of salvation and the teachings of the Savior. We seek the help of the Holy Ghost in order to see things as the Lord sees them.<a href="#_edn24">[xxiv]</a>&nbsp;We may need to reframe questions or view them within the framework or context of the Lord’s standard of truth rather than accept the world’s premises or assumptions.<a href="#_edn25">[xxv]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught this principle brilliantly. He said:</p>
<p>“Because of our knowledge of [the plan of salvation] and other truths that God has revealed, we start with different assumptions than those who do not share our knowledge. As a result, we reach different conclusions on many important subjects that others judge only in terms of their opinions about mortal life. . . .</p>
<p>“. . . [We] will often be better off to respond by identifying the worldly premises or assumptions in the assertions [we] face and then by identifying the different assumptions or premises that guide the thinking of Latter-day Saints.”<a href="#_edn26">[xxvi]</a></p>
<p>This is a profound idea. If we begin with an eternal perspective, we will arrive at conclusions that reflect eternal truth. But if we begin with worldly assumptions, we are likely to arrive at worldly conclusions. So we may need to reframe some questions because we simply do not accept the premises on which they are based.</p>
<p>For example, you have probably been asked, “Shouldn’t any two people who love each other be able to marry?” From the perspective of much of the world, the answer would seem to be yes. But think about what you know about the plan of salvation and about Heavenly Father’s purpose for marriage. The plan of salvation provides an eternal perspective and a gospel premise that reframes the question. Some questions you may consider are “Why is the family ordained of God?” or “Why has the Lord established marriage between a man and a woman?” Think about what you know about the spirit children of Heavenly Father—where they come from and what He wants for them now and in the eternities. Think about why He has blessed us with the power to seal families in temples. How does your understanding of these principles reframe the question and allow you to see the issue through the light of the gospel?</p>
<p>An example of putting this specific question into the context of the plan of salvation was provided by Sister Julie B. Beck, former general president of the Relief Society. She reminded us of the three pillars of the plan of salvation—the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement—suggesting that these are also the pillars of the doctrine of the family. She taught:</p>
<p>“The Creation of the earth provided a place where families could live. God created a man and a woman who were the two essential halves of a family. . . .</p>
<p>“The Fall provided a way for the family to grow. . . .</p>
<p>“The Atonement allows for the family to be sealed together eternally.”<a href="#_edn27">[xxvii]</a></p>
<p>Understanding the central role of families in the plan of salvation helps us to understand that true and lasting happiness, both in this life and in the eternities, is found in forming a family with eternal potential.</p>
<p>One faithful young woman was placed in a difficult position when a friend confided to her and others that she was being tempted by feelings regarding same-gender attraction, which were affecting her feelings about morality. She asked them to be supportive of her decision to act on those feelings. The faithful young woman, armed with an understanding of the doctrine of the family and the importance of eternal ordinances, expressed her love for her friend but respectfully and kindly asked, “Knowing this is your challenge in life, how do you plan to keep your covenants?”</p>
<p>When you consider your understanding of God’s plan and purposes, you begin with a different premise and you then arrive at different conclusions.</p>
<p>Let me share another example of keeping an eternal perspective. Recently a series of newspaper articles reported that some millennials are choosing “‘spirituality’ over organized religion.”<a href="#_edn28">[xxviii]</a>&nbsp;Using this example, let’s imagine that a friend says to you, “You can feel close to God without being religious. Wouldn’t you rather come enjoy His creations than sit in church meetings?”</p>
<p>If the question is “Can you feel close to God while enjoying His creations?” the answer is absolutely yes. But let’s reframe the real question, which is about spirituality and organized religion. What do you know about Heavenly Father’s desire for His children? Is it just to feel close to Him, or is it to become like Him and for each of us to receive eternal life?<a href="#_edn29">[xxix]</a>&nbsp;And what role does attending Church play in whether we receive those ultimate blessings?</p>
<p>First, Jesus organized and then restored His Church in order to provide priesthood keys and revelation<a href="#_edn30">[xxx]</a>&nbsp;so that we might know how to follow Him. Secondly, His Church is the vehicle by which we can have access to saving ordinances and covenants. Appreciating Heavenly Father’s creations and feeling close to Him is critically important, but our Heavenly Father wants us to have and be even more. He wants us to be forgiven, healed, and changed. He wants us to grow and to become like Him so that we may enjoy all that He enjoys. That can happen only through receiving the ordinances He has established—including regularly partaking of the sacrament—and keeping the covenants associated with those ordinances.</p>
<p>Do you see how reframing the question with an eternal perspective dramatically impacts our conclusion? If the question is “Can we feel close to God in nature?” the answer is yes. If the question is “Should we spend Sundays at the beach or in the mountains rather than attend our Church meetings?” the answer is “Not without missing an opportunity to keep and renew sacred covenants that will allow us access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ<a href="#_edn31">[xxxi]</a>&nbsp;in our lives. Not without missing the opportunity to seek forgiveness and healing. Not without missing an opportunity to claim the promised blessing of having His Spirit to be with us.<a href="#_edn32">[xxxii]</a>&nbsp;Not without missing the opportunity to learn from priesthood leaders who hold keys to guide and direct us. And not without forfeiting the opportunity to serve in the Lord’s Church and kingdom, restored to this earth in the latter days.”</p>
<p>Let’s not let a question based on the wrong premise confuse us and cause us to listen to the wrong voices or to run the wrong way.</p>
<p>Here’s the fourth and last principle: Seeking knowledge and understanding from the Lord’s divinely appointed sources dispels darkness, doubt, and confusion.</p>
<p>As part of the Lord’s appointed process for obtaining spiritual knowledge, He has established trustworthy sources through which He reveals truth to His children. He has blessed us with Church leaders and parents to give us guidance. He has given us the scriptures and the gift of the Holy Ghost, which are essential in our efforts to frame questions in an eternal perspective and to find eternal truth. He has given us the gift of latter-day prophets, seers, and revelators. They are a vital and authoritative source of truth. The Lord has chosen and ordained His prophets and apostles to speak for Him<a href="#_edn33">[xxxiii]</a> so that in a world of so many opinions we can with confidence know what is true.</p>
<p>While we can also learn truth through other trustworthy sources, sincere seekers of truth should be wary of unreliable sources of information. We live in a time when many “call evil good, and good evil.”<a href="#_edn34">[xxxiv]</a>&nbsp;Satan is the father of lies and deception, and he seeks to distort truth and persuade us to turn away from the Lord and His appointed servants. Learning to recognize and avoid unreliable sources can protect us from misinformation and from those who seek to destroy faith.</p>
<p>Speaking to members of His newly organized Church in the latter days, the Lord said:</p>
<p>“Thou shalt give heed unto all his [the Prophet Joseph’s] words and commandments. . . .</p>
<p>“For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</p>
<p>“For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you.”<a href="#_edn35">[xxxv]</a></p>
<p>Let’s avoid the trap of thinking that if prophets and apostles are simply giving counsel or policy, we will only agree or follow it if it is convenient or if it meets with our own social, financial, or intellectual aspirations. If we do not understand something that they have taught, we should go directly to their words to seek further understanding instead of relying on what someone else is saying about it second or third hand. Then, after we have studied the teachings of these prophets and apostles, we should turn to the Lord in prayer to help us further understand His mind and will. As Elder M. Russell Ballard recently taught, “James did not say, ‘If any of you lack wisdom, let him Google!’”<a href="#_edn36">[xxxvi]</a> There is too much at stake. If you lack wisdom, ask of God.</p>
<p>There is another important lesson from Lehi’s vision. When we’re taught about the great and spacious building, we are told that those in the building mocked those who were holding to the iron rod and those who had reached the tree. Have you ever wondered what the people in the great and spacious building were saying? Listen to what Nephi wrote:</p>
<p>“[The Lamb of God] was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.</p>
<p>“And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb. . . .</p>
<p>“And the multitude of the earth was gathered together . . . in a large and spacious building. . . . And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great.”<a href="#_edn37">[xxxvii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It saddens me that it is not just the world but some of the house of Israel that mock those holding to the rod. What do you think they’re saying? Whatever it is, it’s an attempt to fight against the Twelve Apostles of the Lord.</p>
<p>What are you hearing in the world today? There are so many voices calling for your attention. Some are mocking sacred and eternal truths about the law of chastity and the crucial role of families. They’re mocking decency and civility and obedience to God’s commandments. They‘re calling evil good and good evil. They’re fighting against the Apostles of the Lamb of God and, therefore, against the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>In my position in Church education, I have the privilege of associating with many Church leaders. I have heard them pray for you. I have heard them express their great love and concern for you. My experience has shown me that their motives are selfless and that their desire is to know and do the will of the Lord. You can trust that they want what is best for you, that they know that the pathway to happiness is in keeping the commandments. My experience has shown me that they are everything you would hope they would be—and more.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Now before I conclude, I would like to share one last story. A few years ago I had the privilege of going to an early-morning devotional for seminary students in my home stake. The speaker was one of the editors of the Joseph Smith Papers project. He gave a wonderful talk about the Prophet Joseph.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the presentation, he asked if any of the youth had questions. A number of hands went up, and it was quickly evident that he would not have time to answer every question. So after responding to a few individuals, he said, “In my work on the Joseph Smith papers, I have read over 10,000 documents, including letters and documents written by Joseph Smith and many written to Joseph Smith. I have read his teachings and recorded revelations. I have read most of what was written about him by those who knew him best. In all of that, I have never read anything that caused me to doubt that Joseph Smith was God’s prophet. And if you have read or heard anything that causes you to doubt that, I am willing to stay and discuss any questions you might have, for as long as it takes.” Most of the youth hurried off to school, but about 30 to 40 of them stayed. They lined up in the aisle of the chapel as this faithful historian came down from the stand to meet them.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of just one of their questions. The first young man asked, “If Joseph Smith went like a lamb to the slaughter at Carthage Jail, why did he take a gun?”</p>
<p>The speaker responded that he had also asked that question and that he had looked for answers in historical accounts from those who personally knew the Prophet and were with him in Carthage Jail, including John Taylor. The speaker had learned that the pistol used by Joseph Smith had been left at the jail earlier that same day by Cyrus Wheelock, a friend of the Prophet. He also learned that one of the reasons John Taylor and Willard Richards had survived that day was because of Joseph Smith’s courage in defending them. The mob had intended to simply go in through the door and shoot each person in the room. But when Joseph stuck the pistol out of the door and fired, the mob became frightened. Instead of bursting into the room, they pushed their guns around the doorframe and fired indiscriminately into the room, not wanting to put themselves in the line of fire. Then they quickly fled the prison in order to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The speaker then pulled from his briefcase a statement from John Taylor, which included the following:</p>
<p>“I was blessed to be associated with Brother Joseph Smith. . . . And this is my testimony concerning [him]. I know before God and the holy angels. I do not think it; I know it. I know that he was a servant of God and prophet of the Lord and lived and died in the faith. I not only know it by my natural sight but by the revelations of God. I know that the desire of Joseph and of Hyrum was to promote peace . . . to promote the happiness and well being of the human family. . . . And although there are thousands of falsehoods in circulation concerning them, and although many of them are believed by the people, yet this was the bona fide feeling of these servants of God while they lived upon the earth; and I know it!”<a href="#_edn38">[xxxviii]</a></p>
<p>As the students continued to ask their questions, I watched the speaker answer by turning to the teachings of prophets. When the questions were about the Prophet Joseph Smith and Church history, he would pull from his briefcase statements by those who knew the Prophet personally and had witnessed his love for people and for the Lord.</p>
<p>Many young people went through the line. I watched as, one by one, they left content that their questions had been answered. They had each been given additional understanding and perspective, and they had been given something more. If they were observant, they had seen an example that they could follow. They had seen someone who has studied from reliable sources, who has paid a price in scholarship, and who has stayed rooted in his faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>My point in sharing that story is that we can find answers to our questions. As you and I go through life, including this divinely appointed process of coming to know and love our Father in Heaven, please do not be perplexed by all the noise and chaos in the world. Don’t get confused like the baseball player who ran the wrong way. You know where to look for truth. You know where to turn for safety in a troubled world. And if all you can do is to run to first base and stand still until the noise subsides, then do that. But do not go back. Call upon your Heavenly Father. He is here to help you—with open and loving arms. Trust Him. He will lead you safely home. He will guide you in your quest to know His Son, the Redeemer of the world, and to know the very points of His doctrine, that you may know how to come unto Him and be saved.</p>
<p>Of this I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>March 15, 2016<br />Richard B Miller<br />Professor of Sociology, BYU<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>One of the great desires of every person on earth is to live a happy life. The good news is that you live in the right place because researchers have found that Hawaii is the happiest state in the United States. That is, in a survey of nearly 200,000 people living in the U.S., people living in Hawaii, overall, have the highest levels of happiness, compared to people living in other states. <a href="#_edn1">[i]</a> So, congratulations on your geographic intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Smith once said, "Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God."<a href="#_edn2">[ii]</a></p>
<p>The book of Mormon provides accounts of people and societies who lived happily. As you will remember, shortly after Lehi died, contention between Laman and Lemuel and those associated with Nephi became so severe that Nephi took his people and departed into the wilderness. There they established a new community where they built a temple, worked hard, and kept the commandments of God. After describing their new life in the wilderness, Nephi simply stated that “we lived after the manner of happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:27</a>). Later in the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Mormon describes the community of Saints after the Savior had visited them. Mormon described how there was love among the people and that there was no contention or dishonesty. He stated that “there could not be happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">4 Nephi 1:16</a>)</p>
<p>What made these people so happy? One important requirement, of course, is that they lived righteously, that they had faith in Christ. Certainly, there are great blessings, including enduring happiness, that come from righteous living. In addition, family life provides countless opportunities to experience great happiness. &nbsp;Indeed, our church leaders have consistently taught that marriage is an important pathway to lasting happiness.<a href="#_edn3">[iii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, President Henry B. Eyring was invited to speak at the Vatican Summit on Marriage. He and Elder L. Tom Perry had been invited by Pope Francis to attend the summit, along with other religious leaders from around the world. President Eyring was invited to share some remarks, which included him reciting passages from the Family Proclamation. At the beginning of his remarks, he stated "I am grateful to be invited to be a witness at this Colloquium. I am especially grateful for the opportunity to give evidence that a man and a woman, united in marriage, have a transcendent power to create happiness for themselves, for their family, and for the people around them. I am an eyewitness of the power of the union of a man and a woman in marriage to produce happiness for each other and for their family…."<a href="#_edn4">[iv]</a></p>
<p>Thus, embedded in the fundamental doctrine that “marriage is ordained of God” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.15?lang=eng#14" target="_blank">(D &amp; C 49:15)</a> is the doctrine that marriage is a crucial pathway to lasting happiness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite these joyous doctrines about marriage, the modern world is experiencing a dramatic retreat from the marriage institution. The combination of young adults delaying marriage into their late 20s or early 30’s, high rates of cohabitation, high divorce rates, and decreasing remarriage rates after divorce have led to record low numbers of married adults in the United States. For example, in 1960, 88% of adults between the ages of 35 and 44 were married. In 2011, the percentage of married in that age group had declined to 65%.<a href="#_edn5">[v]</a> Although the marriage rates in Asia are higher than those in the Western Hemisphere, the trend towards fewer marriages is similar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major reason for this decline in marriage is a growing perception that marriage is more often a source of gloom and despair than a sanctuary of happiness. For example, in a recent large, national study of high school seniors in the United States, only 29% of the girls and 39% of boys agreed with the statement that most people will have fuller and happier lives if they choose legal marriage rather than staying single or just living with someone.<a href="#_edn6">[vi]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our LDS young single adults have been influenced by this worldly tide of negativity regarding marriage. When I have visited with LDS single college students about their perceptions and concerns about marriage, one of the most common responses that I hear is that they are worried about being in a marriage relationship that is miserable. In other words, many LDS young adults worry that marriage is a risky investment that may be unfulfilling and unsatisfying. After all, they can all recite examples of couples they know, often in their own families, who have suffered through miserable marriages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, President Spencer W. Kimball recognized that society had created an inaccurate and unfair perception of marriage. He said, "To offset and neutralize the evil teachings in the media and on the cameras and in the show and on the street, we must teach marriage, proper marriage, eternal marriage."<a href="#_edn7">[vii]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Benefits of Marriage</strong></p>
<p>In response to the concerns of many young adults and in obedience to President Kimball’s call to teach the truth about marriage, I would like to spend a few minutes setting the record straight about marriage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, being married has many benefits. Married people, compared to those who are single, have better physical health. &nbsp;Married people also live longer. For example, being non-married is a greater mortality risk factor for men than having heart disease, and, among women, being non-married is a greater mortality risk factor for women than having cancer. Part of the reason for married people enjoying better health is that they live a healthier lifestyle. Married people drink less alcohol, they eat more nutritiously, they have better sleep habits, and they visit the doctor more frequently. Similarly, married people have significantly lower rates of depression and anxiety.<a href="#_edn8">[viii]</a></p>
<p>Despite the wide spread perception that being married is expensive, research has consistently shown that married people are financially better off than their nonmarried peers. One report stated that “Marriage is a wealth-generating institution.”<a href="#_edn9">[ix]</a> For example, a study of retirement-age adults in the U.S. found that, compared to continuously married adults, those who had never married experienced a 75% reduction in wealth, and those who were currently cohabiting experienced a 58% reduction.<a href="#_edn10">[x]</a> Why are married people better off financially? Research indicates that married people save and invest more of their money. &nbsp;Also, husbands are usually more motivated to be financially productive after marriage. They earn between 10% and 20% more compared to single men with similar job histories and levels of education.<a href="#_edn11">[xi]</a></p>
<p>Second, married people are happier than nonmarried people. For example, research of married people in their 20’s indicates that married people are significantly more likely to report being highly satisfied with their lives than those who are single or cohabiting. Fifty-two percent of married men between the ages of 20 and 28 report being highly satisfied, compared to 35% of single and cohabiting men. Likewise, 47% of women in the age group report being very satisfied, compared to 33% of single and 29% of cohabiting women.<a href="#_edn12">[xii]</a></p>
<p>Third, most marriages are happy. Several years ago some colleagues and I conducted a study of family life. As part of the study, we interviewed a number of LDS families living in the Provo, Utah area. These were middle-aged couples who had at least one adolescent child and who had been married about 20 years. As part of the interview, we asked them to rate on a scale ranging from 1, meaning low, to 10, meaning high, the degree of happiness in their marriage. We found that over three-fourths of both husbands and wives rated their marriage at least an eight, and about 90% of them rated it at least a seven. &nbsp;In addition, the vast majority of the husbands and wives reported that they enjoyed spending time alone, that they felt close to their spouse, and that their love for their spouse had increased over the years.</p>
<p>Fourth, the reported high divorce rate statistics are misleading. We often hear that about 50% of marriages end in divorce, suggesting that a couple getting married has a 50/50 chance of the marriage working out. However, 50% represents the average divorce rate; each couple’s personal probability of divorce varies greatly by specific risk factors. For example, one study indicated that only 16% of women in the U.S. who are college graduates will end up getting a divorce.<a href="#_edn13">[xiii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides education, additional risk factors include low income, becoming pregnant before marriage, marrying before age 20, not being affiliated with a religion, and having parents who divorced.<a href="#_edn14">[xiv]</a> Thus, a couple married in the temple who graduate from BYU-Hawaii and find a good, stable job after graduation actually has a pretty low probability of divorce. They simply don’t have the risk factors that are associated with a high probability of divorce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, cohabitation is greatly overrated. We all know that cohabitation is spiritual poison, but social science research shows that it is a poor precursor to marriage, as well as a poor substitute for marriage. A common assumption about cohabitation is that it makes good sense to live together to find out if you are compatible and your relationship is satisfying before legally getting married. After all, the reasoning goes, you wouldn’t think about buying a car without first test driving it. Why, then, would you think about getting married without living together first?&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the research doesn’t support this widely-held assumption. A recent review of 16 studies that examined the effect of premarital cohabitation on the success of the subsequent marriage found that premarital cohabitation is actually a significant risk factor for lower marital quality and a higher risk of divorce.<a href="#_edn15">[xv] </a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some couples, cohabitation does not represent a precursor to marriage; rather, it is a substitute for marriage, with little intention of eventually getting married. Research clearly indicates, though, that cohabitation is a very poor substitute for marriage. Cohabiting couples are less happy, more depressed, and less financially prosperous than similar couples who are legally married. Children living in the home of cohabiting adults also fair much worse than children who live with legally married parents.<a href="#_edn16">[xvi]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the negative reputation about marriage is without empirical support. Despite what you hear in the popular media, adults who are married have better physical and mental health, have more financial resources, and experience higher levels of happiness in their lives. In addition, most married couples are happy in their relationships, especially couples who are religious and well-educated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, research clearly shows that marriage is the best pathway to living a happy, fulfilling life. It provides support from the social sciences for what Elder Quentin L. Cook said when he gave a commencement address here at BYU-Hawaii several years ago. "Let me assure you that the vast majority of marriages between faithful members of the Church are happy and successful. For those not yet married, you should move forward with faith and confidence toward the ultimate goal of marriage and family…. I assure you that the joy, love, and fulfillment experienced in loving, righteous families produce the greatest possible happiness we can achieve."<a href="#_edn17">[xvii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Choosing the Right Person to Marry&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As I have visited with LDS young adults, another common concern that they express about marriage is the fear that they will make a mistake when they choose their spouse. They are afraid that they will inadvertently marry a “lemon”, which will inevitably lead to a miserable marriage. This is an important issue in the LDS culture because we are making a choice that will last for eternity. President Gordon B. Hinckley said “This choice will be the most important of all the choices you make in your life.<a href="#_edn18">[xviii]</a> ”Consequently, there is a lot at stake, and we don’t want to make an eternal mistake.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of choosing a good partner when we marry, as well as many LDS young adults’ concern about making a good choice, let me offer a few thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In modern society, love has become the basis by which we choose a marriage partner. Even in Asia, arranged marriages are becoming much less common, and young adults usually choose a person to marry based on love. Falling in love is a natural part of the process of dating, becoming engaged, and getting married. Indeed, the wonderful and exquisite feelings of love is an important ingredient in the happiness that we feel within a marriage.</p>
<p>But what, exactly, is love, especially love within marriage? Elder Joe J. Christensen has offered a compelling description of marital love. It is noteworthy that scientific research on love has echoed these same principles. He said, "Love is a difficult word to understand in the English language. For example, I could say to someone that “I love you.” I used exactly those same words this morning speaking to my wife, Barbara, and I meant something very different. We need to know who is speaking to whom in what context. The Greeks don’t have the same problem because they have three different words for love. The first is eros, or romantic love. The English word erotic comes from that Greek root… The second is philia, or brotherly love. The U.S. “City of Brotherly Love,” Philadelphia, gets its name from that Greek root. The third is agape, or Godlike love, the kind of love that enables our Father in Heaven and the Lord to love us even though we are not perfect. I understand that each time in the Greek text of the New Testament when the Lord commands us to love our enemies, it is agape that is used."<a href="#_edn19">[xix]</a></p>
<p>True love, marital love, then, consists of three components: first, romantic love, second, friendship, and, third, Godlike love. After 30 years of teaching about marriage and working with couples who are struggling in their relationship, I am convinced that the key factor for developing a healthy and lasting love and wisely choosing a marriage partner is the development of a strong friendship. In his commencement talk, Elder Cook said, “I would counsel you to find a righteous spouse whom you admire and who will be your best friend.”<a href="#_edn20">[xx]</a></p>
<p>So, who should you marry? You should marry your best friend! Of course, attraction is important, and you will want to marry a righteous, covenant-keeping person who is worthy to marry you in the temple. But you want that person to also be your close, trusted friend. Why? It is because your friendship will provide an anchor in your relationship as you experience the storms of life that challenge all married couples. Friendship is also the steady, stable root structure that provides nurturance to the blossoms of romance. Without that foundation of friendship, the blossoms of romance eventually fade and die.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Marlin K. Jensen has said, "Friendship is… a vital and wonderful part of courtship and marriage. A relationship between a man and a woman that begins with friendship and then ripens into romance and eventually marriage will usually become an enduring, eternal friendship."<a href="#_edn21">[xxi]</a></p>
<p>Elder Marion D. Hanks helped us understand friendship in a marital context when he said, "Friendship in a marriage is so important. It blows away the chaff and takes the kernel, rejoices in the uniqueness of the other, listens patiently, gives generously, forgives freely. Friendship will motivate one to cross the room one day and say, “I’m sorry; I didn’t mean that.” It will not pretend perfection nor demand it. It will not insist that both respond exactly the same in every thought and feeling, but it will bring to the union honesty, integrity. There will be repentance and forgiveness in every marriage—every good marriage—and respect and trust."<a href="#_edn22">[xxii]</a></p>
<p>One of my favorite sociological theories uses the metaphor of the theater to differentiate our front stage from our backstage behavior.<a href="#_edn23">[xxiii]</a> Much of our social interaction represents front stage behavior, indicating that we are trying to impress others, and, thereby, have them think highly of us. A good example is how we act at a job interview. We are on our best behavior, sitting up straight, making eye contact, listening intently, and giving articulate answers. Backstage behavior, on the other hand, is when we are not trying to create any particular impression; we are just being who we are. In backstage behavior, we are willing to reveal both our flaws and are virtues. We are willing to let others see our real selves, not just our best selves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience is that one of the challenges with dating and courtship is that it is too often based primarily on front stage behavior. We put our best foot forward, trying to impress the person that we are dating. Trying to impress someone with our front stage behavior is okay for the first couple of dates, but in order for a true friendship to develop, a couple needs to interact more in the backstage. It is in our backstage behaviors that we develop a deep, genuine friendship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This idea about needing to spend time in a potential spouse’s backstage world is consistent with the teachings of our church leaders. One of the most persistent themes of our church leaders when giving counsel to people choosing a spouse is the need to become well-acquainted with someone you are considering marrying. President Thomas S. Monson has said, "It is essential that you become well acquainted with the person whom you plan to marry, that you can make certain that you are looking down the same pathway, with the same objectives in mind. It is ever so significant that you do this."<a href="#_edn24">[xxiv]</a></p>
<p>Elder Lance B. Wickman likewise said, "Courtship is a time for two people to get acquainted. It is a time to get to know someone, his or her interests, habits, and perspective on life and the gospel. It is a time to share ambitions and dreams, hopes and fears. It is a time to test someone’s commitment to gospel living."<a href="#_edn25">[xxv]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some ways that we can have glimpses into our dating partner’s backstage world and get to know each other better? One way is to spend a lot of time together, (not late at night, of course!) As you spend time together, you will become more comfortable with each other and start “letting your guard down.” Do things that give you the opportunity to talk and get to know each other. Elder Richard G. Scott suggested to men that “When you find you are developing a strong interest in a young woman, ...take her to places that are worthwhile. Show some ingenuity. It is all right to go to the movie after you are married, but it is stupid to do it beforehand. Get to know each other.”<a href="#_edn26">[xxvi]</a> As you spend time together, observe how he or she interacts with others. You can learn a lot by studying and observing your potential partner’s behavior and character when they don’t think you are paying attention. Now, I’m not saying that you should all become private detectives and spy on the person you’re dating. But as President James E Faust said “we should keep our eyes wide open before marriage”<a href="#_edn27">[xxvii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you date, get to know each other, and then fall in love, the depth of your developing friendship will tell you a lot about the quality of your partner, as well as the quality of your relationship. Is your friendship characterized by trust, admiration, dependability, loyalty, humility, honesty, openness, acceptance of each other’s weaknesses, and a willingness to apologize and forgive each other? &nbsp;Does your partner care about your happiness, and are they willing to sacrifice to help you be happy? &nbsp;Like other friendships, the expectation isn’t perfection. After all, good friends don’t expect each other to be perfect. But a friendship that is controlling, belittling, or disrespectful while dating is a serious red flag, warning you that marriage to this person will likely lead to unhappiness and potential disaster. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said, “In a dating and courtship relationship, I would not have you spend five minutes with someone who belittles you, who is constantly critical of you, who is cruel at your expense and may even call it humor.”<a href="#_edn28">[xxviii]</a></p>
<p>This idea of really getting to know each other by developing a strong friendship is consistent with the Lord’s pattern of providing us with revelation. &nbsp;The Lord has taught that you “must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right,” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">D &amp; C 9:8</a>, italics added). Interestingly, President David O. McKay used the word “study” when he taught, “In choosing a companion, it is necessary to study the disposition…of the one with whom you are contemplating making life’s journey.”<a href="#_edn29">[xxix]&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Elder Lance B. Wickman taught, "…you need to get acquainted. Know someone well enough to learn his or her heart and character firsthand…. Only after applying your own judgment and good sense to the relationship after a sufficient period of time should you pray for a confirmation."<a href="#_edn30">[xxx]</a></p>
<p>Thus, the formula for wisely choosing a marriage partner is not attraction and then asking for a spiritual confirmation; it isn’t a two-step process. Rather, the formula is attraction, getting to know each other at a deep level, developing a strong friendship, determining that this friendship will work in a covenanted, gospel-centered marriage, and then asking for a spiritual confirmation. Using this formula will lead to a very low probability of making a tragic mistake in whom you marry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that marriage is the pathway to lasting happiness. Despite what the world is currently saying, marriage offers the surest path to happiness. I’m not saying this from a naïve, uninformed position. I have spent 30 years working with couples who are struggling to make their marriages work. Consequently, I’ve seen the dark side of marriage. But I have seen many, many more couples who continue to maintain a strong, happy relationship regardless of the challenges that they face. Because of that, I remain profoundly optimistic about the happiness that marriage can bring. &nbsp;</p>
<p>May you marry your best friend; I did. My relationship with my wife has brought me an unmeasurable amount of happiness. Life hasn’t always been easy. Like most couples, we’ve experienced stresses and trials. But through it all, we have kept our friendship strong, and, now, after nearly 30 years of marriage, I’m still happily married to my best friend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you wisely choose your marriage partner and confidently embrace the institution of marriage, I testify that you, like Nephi, will be able to say that “we lived after the manner of happiness”.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President &amp; Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">ALOHA!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We are so pleased to be with you today. We are especially pleased to speak together.&nbsp; Susan and I love to serve together.&nbsp; We are best as a team. Susan is a “help” perfectly “meet” for me.&nbsp; For me, she is like Mary Poppins in the movie we showed to our grandchildren last week.&nbsp; On my tape measure she is “Practically Perfect.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">And I fall in love with John all over again when I hear him speak. He’s a master teacher and my muse.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">And we both have fallen in love with this place since we arrived here seven months ago.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We love the “aloha” spirit here.&nbsp; We love the sense of family we feel here in our new BYU ohana.&nbsp; We love the faculty, staff, and students.&nbsp; And we love the prophetic history and mission of BYU–Hawaii.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The founding mission and prophecies rest constantly upon our minds and hearts.&nbsp; We want to help BYU–Hawaii become the university that prophets have envisioned—a school that savors of Zion, as both President Eyring and I said at my inauguration. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I have long loved to study the Zion societies in the scriptures.&nbsp; What characterizes such communities?&nbsp; They are characterized by unity, righteousness, love, and holiness. The prophet Enoch’s Zion society was even called the “City of Holiness.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">So today we want to talk with you about holiness, one of the hallmarks of Zion. We’ve entitled our remarks “More Holiness Give Me” <a href="#_edn1">[i]</a> &nbsp;after the hymn we just sang.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">That beautiful hymn ends with words “More blessed and holy—More Savior like thee.”&nbsp; This expresses the deep yearning we have for ourselves and for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">To become more holy is to become more like God.&nbsp; Holiness describes the very nature of God and all that is godlike. Real holiness requires that our goodness and godliness go all the way down to the depth of our souls. So this is our message today: to strive to become “More blessed and holy, More Savior like thee.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">THE MEANING OF HOLINESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">As Susan and I have studied about holiness, we’ve come to realize that “holy” is a key term in the gospel.&nbsp; Susan discovered that it is used in the titles of every member of the Godhead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">That’s right!&nbsp; Heavenly Father is called “Holy Father” and “Man of Holiness.” Jesus is called the “Holy Messiah” and the “Holy One of Israel.”&nbsp; And of course the third member of the Godhead is called the “Holy Ghost” and the “Holy Spirit,” as well as the “Holy Spirit of Promise.” To be holy is to partake in the nature of God.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The term “holy” also is used often in scripture to describe things associated with God and godliness, such as:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The Holy Priesthood, the Holy of Holies, holy places, holy callings, holy ordinances, a holy people, holy days (such as the Sabbath), holy mountains, holy cities, the holy scriptures, holy garments, the holy apostleship, and on and on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The word “holiness” is even carved above the entrance to every temple in the phrase “HOLINESS TO THE LORD.” In the same way, we should engrave “HOLINESS TO THE LORD” in our hearts, for we are living temples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">So what does the term “holy” mean? I like to understand words by excavating their origins.&nbsp; The word “holy” comes from an Old English root “hálig”, which is related to the concept whole and health.&nbsp; I like this.&nbsp; It suggests that a holy life is a whole life, a pure life, a life fully devoted to godliness. A person or place becomes holy when it has been touched by God and filled with godliness.&nbsp; You can’t truly be holy if you are faking it.&nbsp; As you said, Susan, real holiness requires that our goodness and godliness go all the way down to the depth of our souls.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">For me the word “holy” also signifies anything that is hallowed, or sacred, or consecrated, or set apart for sacred purposes.&nbsp; When I worked with Young Women, I liked camp because it provided a place set apart from the world, where girls could have sacred, testimony-building experiences. For many young women, it became a holy place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The Sabbath is set apart for sacred purposes; and that is how we keep it holy.&nbsp; A temple marks a place set apart for sacred purposes.&nbsp; We are commanded to keep it holy as well and never pollute or profane it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">It is interesting that the root meaning of temple is “a place set apart” for sacred purposes. And the opposite of sacred is profane. “Profane” literally means what is outside the temple.&nbsp; Thus profanity takes something that is inherently sacred and holy—like the name of God—and treats it in unholy ways, such as by using it as a curse word.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">It seems to me that our world is awash in profanity of every sort.&nbsp; Secular society has forgotten how to reverence what is holy, whether this is the Lord’s name, or the Sabbath day, or the temple of our bodies, or our sacred procreative powers.&nbsp; Emma Smith – and all of us – were given the counsel to “lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better” <a href="#_edn2">[ii]</a>.&nbsp; We hope that those who come here will to learn to shun the profane, the worldly and embrace the sacred as they learn to savor Zion here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">In ancient times, this is one of the great lessons the Lord tried to teach Israel.&nbsp; He wanted his people to learn to “put a difference” between the holy and the profane.&nbsp; He chastised ancient Israel because, like us: “they have put no difference between the holy and unholy, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them” <a href="#_edn3">[iii]</a>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We tried to teach our children to put a difference between the holy and unholy even when they were young.&nbsp; We taught them to dress modestly even before they matured physically.&nbsp; We tried to teach them to be reverent in church, especially during the sacrament, even before they could fully understand the significance of what the sacrament means.&nbsp; We taught them that some words are profane even before they could possibly understand why.&nbsp; We wanted them to learn early on to “put a difference between the holy and unholy.” We want you, too, to learn this here in your university home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">So brothers and sisters we challenge you to learn to put a difference between the holy and profane while you are here.&nbsp; You will come to savor Zion as you: Learn to delight in the Sabbath and in righteousness. Learn to love uplifting music and to find pleasure in seeking wisdom out the best books and movies.&nbsp; Learn to cherish chastity and to dress modestly.&nbsp; And learn the peace and power that comes from always acting with integrity. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">By striving to build Zion here you are preparing to build Zion elsewhere—in your homes, your home stakes, and your home countries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Building a holy Zion-society, like becoming a holy person, is a process. It doesn’t happen overnight.&nbsp; It takes conscientious effort to become “More blessed and holy; More Savior like thee”—and it also requires help from Heaven.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">One way we can accelerate the process is by standing in holy places.&nbsp; Another word for holy places is “sanctuaries.”&nbsp; There are many sanctuaries or holy places we can stand in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I love to stand in the sanctuary of the Lord’s House.&nbsp; I have been privileged to serve as a temple worker.&nbsp; This has truly been a sweet, sanctifying experience for me.&nbsp; As temple workers, we are frequently reminded to seek to be holy so that we can perform the sacred work in a way that helps patrons feel a spirit of holiness in the House of the Lord.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I encourage all of us—whether faculty, staff, or students—to stand often in the sanctuary of the Lord’s House.&nbsp; I promise you, this will grace your life with greater peace and holiness.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We are so blessed to study and work in the shadow of a temple. I am convinced that the prophet David O. McKay located the Church College of Hawaii here in Laie so that this house of learning and light would take its bearings from the Lord’s House of Learning and Light. I echo Susan’s promise: You will find greater peace and holiness in the House of the Lord. So go to the temple as often as you can!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Another holy place is, or should be, our own homes.&nbsp; When my mother first went to the temple, she felt the beauty, order, purity, and cleanliness there.&nbsp; She determined that she would try to create that same feeling in her own home.&nbsp; She wanted her home to be “a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.” <a href="#_edn4">[iv]</a>.&nbsp; And it became so. This was the home I grew up in.&nbsp; It was truly a sanctuary from the world.</span></p>

We have seen it in missionary apartments, haven’t we Susan? Sister Tanner oversaw inspections of many missionary apartments in Brazil.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">There was such a difference in the spirit of a missionary apartment that was clean and orderly—where the bed was made, the trash taken out, the bathrooms and kitchen cleaned—and ones that were dirty and disorderly. Some apartments invited the Spirit.&nbsp; They provided holy places for missionaries to study, prepare, and pray.&nbsp; Others did not.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I rewarded missionaries who had clean apartments with treats.&nbsp; I would like to do the same for you students, but we want to respect your privacy. However, you will receive the reward of the Spirit if you keep a clean apartment; there is no better reward than this.</span></p>

Students and teachers were to come prayerfully and prepared to participate; they were to learn together in the spirit of love, “that all may be edified of all” <a href="#_edn5">[v]</a>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">A man named Zebedee Coltrin said this about studying in the School of the Prophets: “we came together in the morning about sunrise, fasting, and partook of the Sacrament each time; and before going to school we washed ourselves and put on clean linen.” The School of the Prophets truly provided a temple-like educational experience that transformed the lives of all those who attended it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The Prophet Joseph describes how the teacher in the School would kneel in prayer before he taught and then would greet the students, “as friend and brother,” in the bonds of love.&nbsp; There is a pattern for us here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I encourage faculty to pray for your students in your private prayers, and to pray with your students in class.&nbsp; Also cultivate a spirit of love and respect in your classrooms.&nbsp; Let there be preparation, engagement, reflection, and standards of excellence.&nbsp; Let your classrooms also become a place where all are invited to learn of all, and where the Spirit enhances learning. In short, a holy place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I felt the same thing in a class I taught here last semester.&nbsp; That classroom became a hallowed place for me on this campus.&nbsp; And through our experience together, the students and I all felt an outpouring of learning and love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">That’s why I say that the classroom can become a holy place.&nbsp; I have felt it as both student and teacher.&nbsp; Not always, but sometimes something sacred occurs between student and teacher as we learn together.&nbsp; When this happens, I feel that I should remove my shoes, for the classroom has become holy ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Another holy place for me is often nature.&nbsp; When I first arrived in Hawaii on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon last July, I exulted the entire drive from Honolulu to Laie about the vast turquoise ocean with rolling white capped waves on one side of the road and the lush green cliffs flanking me on the other side.&nbsp; At every turn in the road the new vista seemed to beckon me to “come, jump in the water.”&nbsp; And I am not even much of a swimmer!&nbsp; I believe that this beautiful world was deliberately given to us by a loving Heavenly Father to bless us – “both to please the eye and gladden the heart” <a href="#_edn6">[vi]</a>.&nbsp; It is a beautiful, sacred gift.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">But I want to add a word of caution about the possible drain of beach culture on our personal holiness.&nbsp; One’s thoughts can be lulled into carnal places with what I call the “walking pornography” that sometimes surrounds us. I admit that sometimes I feel that drain on me.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">One can also get caught up in a coarse, casual, worldly lifestyle at the beach. The worldliness of beach culture can also drain the Spirit away if you are not careful. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Like many of you, I find great peace and tranquility in the beauty and the sound of the sea. And I enjoy and am enlivened by the fun and physicality of exercising and participating in water sports.&nbsp; But it’s important to keep the Spirit even at the beach.&nbsp; So be modest in what you wear at the beach and as you go to and from the beach.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>

Make sure your experiences at the beach strengthen your spirituality rather than diminish it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Great counsel!&nbsp; In addition to standing in holy places, such as temples, homes, classrooms, and nature, we must bring holiness to the places we stand, wherever we are.&nbsp; The scriptures say that we are to become holy temples. Paul taught, “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you” <a href="#_edn7">[vii]</a>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We live in a great age of temple construction.&nbsp; What a blessing this is! However, the Lord does not want His people merely to build holy temples but to become holy temples.&nbsp; He does not desire us merely to go through the temple.&nbsp; He desires the temple to go through us.&nbsp; President Hinckley often used to ask me and other Church leaders, “How can we get the gospel deep down in the hearts of the people?”&nbsp; This has always been the deepest desire of the Lord and his prophets.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Indeed!&nbsp; The scriptures teach that God’s laws should be written not merely on tables of stone but on the fleshly tables of the heart <a href="#_edn8">[viii]</a>.&nbsp; The Lord wants to put the law in His people’s “inward parts” and write it in their hearts. &nbsp;Only then, He says, shall I, the Lord, truly be “their God, and they shall be my people” <a href="#_edn9">[ix]</a>.&nbsp; This is what it means to become the Lord’s holy people.&nbsp; It is to have the gospel deep in our hearts so that our lives can be sanctified and holy, like a temple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">In this way we can become living temples in an increasingly profane world.&nbsp; There are 149 functioning temples today and over 15 million members.&nbsp; So for every temple of stone, there are potentially 100,000 living temples. Think what it would mean if each member radiated the same Spirit of the Lord as do our temple edifices.&nbsp; Just think if Latter-day Saints kept themselves as comely and clean, as pure and holy, as we do our temples.&nbsp; If our lives were truly inscribed with “HOLINESS TO THE LORD” others would feel the same sense of serenity and sanctity around us as they do when visiting our temples.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

When you see it, remember that you and I are to be such a light on a hill. We are to be light bearers for a dark world that desperately needs the light of the gospel.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">One way you can become light bearers is by making and keeping sacred covenants.&nbsp; Our covenants enable us to become “more blessed and holy; more Savior like thee.” When covenant-making Latter-day Saints emerge from the waters of baptism, or leave the sacrament table, or come out of the House of the Lord, they “go forth [into the world] . . . armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory round about them” <a href="#_edn11">[xi]</a>.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I remember an experience when John was armed with power and holiness after participating in the ordinance of the sacrament. A number of years ago when our family lived in Brazil for a short while, we were in an auto accident.&nbsp; As we drove home from Sacrament meeting in pouring rain, we entered a neighborhood intersection.&nbsp; A car pulled out from behind a parked vehicle and hit us, broadside.&nbsp; Fortunately no one in either of the cars was injured, but the automobiles were both pretty badly dented.&nbsp; As John got out to discuss the accident with the other driver, I kept reminding him that it was not our fault.&nbsp; Soon he returned to the car and slowly drove back to the little farmhouse where we were living, to the sound of metal grinding against the tires on every rotation.&nbsp; The other car followed.&nbsp; All John said was, “I’ll explain later.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">When we got home, John found our little envelope of emergency cash and paid the family to get their car repaired.&nbsp; They happily left.&nbsp; I was astonished.&nbsp; Then John gathered our family together to explain his actions.&nbsp; “You probably think I’m foolish because I know this accident was not our fault.&nbsp; But as I was negotiating with this family, the thought kept coming into my mind that a little over an hour ago I had covenanted with Heavenly Father to always act as Jesus would.&nbsp; I knew that if He were standing in my position, he would have had compassion on this family, who was so poor, and would have done all he could to help them.” That day John hadn’t just taken the sacrament; it had taken hold of him.&nbsp; He came away a holier, better person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">John had had a sacred Sacrament experience, and as Moses says after one of his sacred communications with God, “the Spirit had not altogether withdrawn from me.” It gave him the power to act in holiness.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We often taught this to our missionaries. We frequently reminded them that the first law of Heaven is obedience. Like you students, they, too, had signed a letter agreeing to abide by certain standards.&nbsp; Their call letter says, “you will be expected to maintain the highest standards of conduct and appearance by keeping the commandments [and], living mission rules.”&nbsp; The moment they sign this call, their honor is at stake.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Absolutely!&nbsp; And note that the call letter from the prophet refers to both “commandments” and “rules.” A missionary is expected to live commandments, like the laws of chastity and modesty.&nbsp; He is also expected to obey rules related to chastity, like not being alone with a member of the opposite sex, and related to modesty like wearing white shirts and ties.&nbsp; Now mission rules do not refer to inherently evil actions, but violating them is immoral because it involves breaking your word. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The Honor Code also contains commandments (like chastity and the Word of Wisdom) and rules (like no beards). And once you agree to live by these rules, to break them is to break a commandment: which is the commandment to be honest and keep your promises.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We saw some missionaries who justified themselves in violating the rules because they were only rules, and not commandments.&nbsp; But this disobedience and rebellious behavior caused them to lose the Spirit.&nbsp; Disobedience and holiness just don’t mix.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">There is a parallel in the law between commandments and rules, which may help you understand the point. The law distinguishes between two broad categories of crimes: those that are malum in se (meaning evil in themselves—like murder) and those malum prohibitum (meaning evil because they are forbidden—like jaywalking). A just society depends on people choosing to be law-abiding, whether the laws deal with murder or jaywalking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Similarly, to enjoy a Zion society, we need to be people of integrity who keep our word because we have given it.&nbsp; The Spirit will not long strive with promise-breakers.&nbsp; You know this.&nbsp; You can feel the Spirit leave you when you start violating your promises and disobeying standards you have agreed to live.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Long ago the founding father of BYU, Karl G. Maeser, taught this principle in a powerful, memorable way.&nbsp; He spoke of a chalk circle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I love the way he taught this principle. It has helped generations of students understand what it means to keep your word.&nbsp; Brother Maeser said:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">“I have been asked what I mean by ‘word of honor.’ I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls–walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground–there is a possibility that in some way or another I may escape; but stand me on the floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of the circle? No. Never! I’d die first!” <a href="#_edn12">[xii]</a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">We need men and women here like Karl G. Maeser, who would die before they would break their word of honor!&nbsp; Who keep the Honor Code both because it contains sound principles AND simply because they promised that they would!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Before we conclude, we need to add words of caution against two spiritual dangers related to the pursuit of holiness.&nbsp; One is the danger of pretending to be holy; the other is the danger of feeling “holier than thou.”&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Some people pretend to be holy by putting on a show of holiness and piety when they are not.&nbsp; This is called sanctimonious. Sanctimonious people are concerned with the show of sanctity, not the substance.&nbsp; Sanctimony is what happens when you mix holiness with hypocrisy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I recall that the Savior delivered some of his strongest denunciations against the sanctimonious Pharisees. He called them “whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness” <a href="#_edn13">[xiii]</a>. We must not be like them!&nbsp; As I said before, our goodness and godliness must go right to the core of our being.&nbsp; True holiness requires us to do the right things for the right reasons, to be good inside and out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">But Susan, none of us is perfect.&nbsp; We all have some dead men’s bones, some uncleanness inside.&nbsp; So how can we avoid being hypocrites while still striving to be holy?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I suppose that we can avoid being hypocritically pious by not pretending that we are perfect.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">That’s right.&nbsp; It’s not the bones inside the sepulcher, but the whiting on the outside that is the problem.&nbsp; And I can give you a kind of embarrassing story on myself to show the problem.&nbsp; As a student, I once wanted to impress you that I was a spiritual person. And I was actually feeling spiritual, having just come from an inspiring Devotional.&nbsp; So I starting whistling a hymn, hoping you would notice.&nbsp; As they say in Portuguese: Que vergonha! How embarrassing even now to recall.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Fortunately, however, I caught myself in the act.&nbsp; I quickly realized that to truly BE holy, you can’t be trying to impress others that you are.&nbsp; You simply have to be good and not try to make others think you are good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Fortunately, I knew of your internal goodness, and I was impressed with that.&nbsp; John, you said that the scriptures warn against another form of false holiness, which you called being “holier than thou.”&nbsp; Talk about that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Not only should we not pretend to be holier than we are, we should not presume that we are holier than others. This is the spiritual disease of the Zoramites on the tower Rameumptom. Their eyes are not looking upward single to the glory of God but constantly glancing downwards in contempt for their neighbors and full of a sense of their own glory. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">The wealthy Zoramites were guilty of feeling “holier than thou” toward their poor neighbors. Such a feeling is never holy.&nbsp; The sense of spiritual superiority sometimes afflicts Latter-day Saints who are trying to build Zion.&nbsp; This seems to have happened with some of the early Saints in Missouri, and it may have exacerbated the troubles with their neighbors.&nbsp; It is something that we as Latter-day Saints trying to build Zion have to guard against.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Sister Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">Now let us conclude with our testimonies.&nbsp; Although holiness is difficult to achieve, it is something toward which we should all strive.&nbsp; When I served in Young Women, I often reminded young women and their leaders that each guidebook for the youth (Pers. Progress, Duty to God, the manuals and the medallions) has a picture of the temple on it. Why?&nbsp; These are all temple preparation books.&nbsp; They point us to the temple.&nbsp; And the temple points to a holy life, a god-like life, and ultimately to a return to Heavenly Father.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">My concluding compliment to you as a student body and university community is that as Nehemiah said “[you] are doing a great work, so that [you] cannot come down” <a href="#_edn14">[xiv]</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We applaud the goodness and holiness that we see and feel from you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">And as we strive to improve, I offer a concluding admonition to each of us from the words of the prophet Joseph F. Smith.&nbsp; We must “lead the world. . .in everything that is praise-worthy, everything that is God-like, everything that is uplifting and that is purifying.&nbsp; You are called by the voice of the Prophet of God . . . to be . . . the purest and the most devoted to the right.” <a href="#_edn15">[xv]</a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I testify that we are His children, blessed with a divine heritage and a most sacred responsibility to be holy.&nbsp; I know He loves us and will help us in our strivings to be “more blessed and holy, more Savior like thee.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">President Tanner:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">I, too, testify that what we have taught is true.&nbsp; The Lord wants us to be holy, for he is holy, and he wants us to become like him.&nbsp; As the apostle Peter says, “But as he that has called you is holy, so be ye holy. . . . Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy” <a href="#_edn16">[xvi]</a>.&nbsp; This is “not idealist gas,” as C. S. Lewis says of the commandment to be perfect.&nbsp; It is the very purpose of the plan and shall be the end of a process of sanctification which requires all we can do AND the Lord’s enabling, cleansing grace working in us.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">My dear brothers and sisters: May we become “more blessed and holy; more Savior like thee.”&nbsp; May we be among the redeemed who one day shall surround God’s holy throne, “clothed in white raiment,” praising him with the words “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty” <a href="#_edn17">[xvii]</a> and receiving from Him and from His Holy Son, blessing, honor, dominion, power, and glory forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &amp;amp; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>
