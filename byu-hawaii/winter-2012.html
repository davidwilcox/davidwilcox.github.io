<p>April 14, 2012<br />Elaine S. Dalton<br />Young Women General President<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>To President Wheelwright and to the graduating class of BYU-Hawaii, your parents and families, and to your professors and associates, may I say that it is a privilege to be here to honor your accomplishments today with a few words of advice and counsel upon your commencement from this university. You may look before you to a bright, clear future.  You are living in these days by divine appointment. Your capacity to achieve is reflected today in this moment. And many more such moments lie ahead for you. Indeed, I wish to begin with and emphasize a scripture found in <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.62?lang=eng">Doctrine and Covenants 45:62</a>. It reads:  "For verily I say unto you, that great things await you."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this day of commencement, I would like to share with each of you some advice my mother and grandfather gave to me.  It is advice I have never forgotten and I hope you will remember it as well. I hope it will guide you on your journey through life as it has guided me. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remember Who You Are!</strong><br /> The first is to realize that great things await you as you remember who you are. Whenever I left our home, my mother's parting words were always, "Remember who you are." Once, I questioned her about what she meant. Her reply was clear and correct. She said, "Remember that you not only represent yourself, but your family, and you represent the Church and the Lord."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remembering who you are should help you remain optimistic. You must always remember that God knows you and He knows what you have the capacity to achieve.  You have been uniquely positioned in time and place to prepare to shape the future:  to lead, to lift, and to build. You must never be like the world. You have been uniquely prepared to be <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unique!</span></em>&nbsp; You are sons and daughters of God. And because of that knowledge, your response will not be the same as the world's response to any situation. You not only know who you are, but <em>whose </em>you are! That knowledge alone is now, and will continue to be, reflected in all your actions, reactions and associations. C.S. Lewis said it best when he said, "It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses. . .There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal" (The Weight of Glory, New York:  Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Co. , 1980, pp. 18-19).</p>
<p>As you remember who you are, you will go forward with faith and with confidence in every footstep. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Work Hard<br /></strong>The second thing I want to share with you is some advice my grandfather gave me a long time ago. It is the secret of all great accomplishments. It is to learn to, and love to, work hard. It is to find satisfaction in going the distance and in completing a task, and to love the labor of it all.</p>
<p>You have worked hard in order to come to this place of commencement and your efforts have been rewarded. Some of you will leave here seeking employment, some already have found a place to contribute, some will return to your home and use your education to lift and lead and build your family and your church and community. And for all, this commencement is only just the beginning.</p>
<p>It will take more than dreams to accomplish your goals. It will take work. A winner of one of the marathons held in my hometown of Salt Lake City was interviewed after his victorious run about his marathon training plans and his secrets of success. His name was Araya Haregot from Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, the average annual wage is $400.00 (U.S. dollars), so $25,000 in prize money is astounding. It is literally 50 years of income for one man.  These Ethiopian runners run for more than themselves and personal glory. They run for their family and for their village. That is what motivates them to sacrifice and even suffer:  their desire to help others. They run with such heart. This is what Araya Haregot said of his win:  "I should have run a 2: 10 marathon." The interviewer said:  "But you won!" His reply was that winning is within self. It requires self-discipline and achieving personal victories and personal goals.  When asked the secret to his success and the success of the other African runners that day, he simply said four words. "Hard work. Hard work."&nbsp; His personal motto was "Hard training:  easy marathon" (Unpublished news reporter's interview with Araya Haregot on&nbsp; April 23, 2005). The hills were not eliminated and neither was the opposition, but he knew that one can be in shape to navigate them. He knew what you know. You can "press forward with a . . . perfect brightness of hope" (2 Nephi 31: 20).</p>
<p><strong>Train For Adversity</strong><br /> The third bit of advice is also simple:  Train for adversity and remember the little victories. What do I mean by that? Let me share with you what a six-time triathlon winner said of the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. "It is not the distance that overwhelms people who race Hawaii's Ironman Triathlon. It's the relentless wind that blows across the lava fields. You're on one of the highest ridges, you see miles of repetitive road to Kona, and you realize it's extremely hot and you're going straight into a 30-mile-an-hour crosswind. I've found that those who dwell on these conditions tend to fold. I always train for adversity. I consider adversity an asset, something to turn around to my advantage. One of life's most important lessons is learning to put your losses in perspective and to savor your triumphs by riding on euphoria's wave. Have high goals and expectations; regard defeats as stages on the road to success by remembering the little victories that have gotten you where you are" (Dave Scott, <a href="http://bcihp.ca/coachescorner.html">http: //bcihp.ca/coachescorner.html</a>). And in the famous words of Winston Churchill, "Never, never, never give up" (Winston Churchill, "Never Give In," Harrow School, October 29, 1941).</p>
<p><strong>Dream Big!</strong><br /> And fourth:  Dream big! "One of life's most important lessons is learning to put your losses in perspective and to savor your triumphs by riding on euphoria's wave.  Have high goals and expectations; regard defeats as stages on the road to success by remembering the little victories that have gotten you where you are" (Dave Scott, <a href="http://bcihp.ca/coachescorner.html">http: //bcihp.ca/coachescorner.html</a>). Don't lose sight of your dreams and when you dream: dream BIG. It has been well said by architect Daniel Burnham, of Chicago, "Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big" (Burnham, Daniel, <a href="http://www.ontko.com/pub/rayo/burnham.html">http: //www.ontko.com/pub/rayo/burnham.html</a>). And remember attitude is everything. So, keep a positive outlook.  Look for the silver lining. Don't get discouraged. Don't focus all your energy on negative situations, or people, for that matter. Keep going. Put one foot in front of the other. To paraphrase the words to one of my favorite songs:  Smile wide, walk with pride, and when you dream, dream big. Because when you dream it might come true. When you laugh, laugh out loud, and remember to see the beauty all around you and in yourself. When you pray, pray for strength to carry on in the midst of trials that will come your way. And&nbsp; when you dream, dream big! ("Dream Big," Ryan Shupe and The RubberBand).</p>
<p><strong>Winners Do Not Always Finish First</strong><br /> Last: remember that winners do not always finish first. <strong></strong>This may seem to contradict everything you have learned and prepared to do. In our society we are taught from childhood that winners always come out on top. They make the most money and the win they medals and they receive the recognition. We are taught that life is a competition and that everyone who is competing with you is a threat to your success. We are also taught that there is only one winner. The rest take second place (<em>Music and the Spoken Word</em>, "Winners Do Not Always Finish First," February 19, 2012). Now in light of what I have just said, let me tell you of a group of youth who trained for and entered the Special Olympics. It occurred at the Seattle, Washington Special Olympics a few years ago. The story was told of "nine contestants, all physically or mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the hundred-yard dash.</p>
<p>"At the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish for running the race to the finish and winning. All, that is, except one little boy, who stumbled on the asphalt, tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry." The other eight heard the boy cry. They slowed down and looked back. Then they all turned around and went back . . . every one of them.</p>
<p>"One girl with Down's syndrome bent down and kissed him and said, 'This will make it better.' Then all nine linked arms and walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood, and the cheering went on for several minutes. People who were there are still telling the story.</p>
<p>"Why? Because deep down we know that what matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What matters in this life is helping others win, even if it means slowing down and changing our course. . . . We achieve happiness when we seek the happiness and well-being of others" (Kirk Douglas, <em>My Stroke of Luck</em>, (New York:  HarperCollins, 2002), 162-63).</p>
<p>In paraphrasing Barbara Bush she said what happens in the White House isn't near as important as what happens in <em>your</em> house (<a href="http://gos.sbc.edu/b/bush.html">http: //gos.sbc.edu/b/bush.html</a>, emphasis added). My mother's advice to me has now become my advice to you and so I repeat once more: "Remember who you are!" You are not ordinary. You are extraordinary and you have been reserved to be here on the earth when the challenges and the opportunities are the greatest. My grandfather tells the story of a famous actor of his time, Edwin Booth, who was once asked why he could give such splendid renditions of dramatic selections before an audience. He said it was because he always envisioned a king in the audience.</p>
<p>Today, I see kings and queens in the audience of this commencement gathering. You will be blessed by the King of Kings as you remember who you are and live what you know, as you continue to work hard and train for adversity, as you never give up, as you dream big, and as you remember that winners do not always finish first.</p>
<p>Now, run into your marathon of faith and life. Don't get discouraged by the hills, but see the opportunity in adversity. Go with a sure foot and a sure knowledge that you are never alone. As I have said on many occasions, I will repeat here today, "I truly believe that one virtuous young man or young woman led by the spirit can change the world." I do and you will! Great things await you! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>April 14, 2012<br />Danielle Rodgers Hitz<br />Student Speaker<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Good morning everyone and aloha!</p>
<p>Graduates, I want to congratulate you on getting to this point in your lives. We are so blessed to have had the opportunity to attend this institution, and I know that each and every one of you will go on to bless the lives of many with the education that you have received here at BYU-Hawaii.</p>
<p>I want to take this time to thank our parents, family members, friends, and professors for helping us get to this point. You have been amazing examples to all of us, and you have taught us many principles that we will carry with us for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>We have all learned different lessons and had to face our own trials or "Goliaths," as some prophets have called them, since we came to BYU-Hawaii. I am grateful for the trials and experiences that I have had here as they have taught me important lessons and they have made me a much stronger individual. Today I want to share with you three tools that will help us overcome the inevitable Goliaths that we will have to face in the future, whatever they may be. Hopefully these pointers will bring you confidence and comfort as many of us are facing the future of the unknown.</p>
<p>The first tool is perseverance. James E. Faust said<em>, "Perseverance is demonstrated by those who keep going when the going gets tough, who don't give up even when others say, "It can't be done"</em>&nbsp;("Perseverance," Ensign, May 2005).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I think it is fair to say that we will never get anywhere in life if we always give up. We need to be willing to do our part in this life, and to seek out opportunities that uplift us and others. For instance, if we are given a phenomenal cookie recipe, nothing is going to happen unless we actually put forth the effort to do something with this recipe. We need to go out and buy the ingredients and put everything together ourselves. This applies to our lives. Life becomes much more fulfilling when we persevere and do our part to make things happen. We need to always do our best to reach our goals in life, no matter what Goliaths may try and prevent us from succeeding.</p>
<p>Joseph B. Wirthlin said: <em>"Perseverance is a positive, active characteristic. It is not idly, passively waiting and hoping for some good thing to happen. It gives us hope by helping us realize that the righteous suffer no failure except in giving up and no longer trying" </em>("Never Give Up," Ensign, November 1987).</p>
<p>The second tool is potential. We all need to remember that we have great potential, and that we were sent to this earth to succeed, not fail. Do all of you really know who you are and what you are capable of? We are all children of God. We are all divine, and we have so much in store for us. This knowledge gives us the strength and confidence we need to overcome our Goliaths.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley said: <em>"You are a child of God. You have His power within you to sustain you. You have the right to call upon God to protect you. Do not let Goliath frighten you. Stand your ground and hold your place, and you will be triumphant" </em>("Overpowering the Goliaths in Our Lives," Ensign, January 2002).</p>
<p>What a powerful statement. We will be triumphant as we have a divine power about us. I hope and pray that all of you will always remember your potential as sons and daughters of God. We all have remarkable talents and abilities within us. It is up to us to discover our potential, and we can discover this through perseverance and prayer.</p>
<p>This leads to my third and final tool which is the most powerful tool of all; prayer. When Goliaths come our way, when we face the unknown, when we do not know if we can keep moving forward, then this is when we need to humbly kneel and pray to our Father in Heaven. Brothers and sisters, we are never alone. Heavenly Father loves all of us, and He wants us to turn to Him for help. I know that our Heavenly Father will guide us in our endeavors. He has a plan for all of us, and if we put our trust in Him then we will know that everything is going to be ok.</p>
<p>Prayer can help us with the first two tools that I discussed. We can pray to help us remain strong, to remain hopeful, and to have the power to persevere. We can also pray to help us remember who we really are and to recognize the great potential within us.</p>
<p>I know that if we persevere, if we remember our potential, and we if turn to our Heavenly Father in prayer then we can overcome our personal Goliaths. These three tools are keys to success in this life. I know our Heavenly Father and Savior, Jesus Christ, love us more than we can comprehend and they are going to help us with the Goliaths that we will face once we leave BYU-Hawaii.</p>
<p>I'd like to say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media120414wheelwright<br><title>Building on a Sure Foundation | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>April 14, 2012<br />Steven C. Wheelwright<br />President, BYU-Hawaii<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Since President David O. McKay presided and spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony for this special campus in 1955, much has been said about the impact and contribution that you and so many other graduates would make as you departed from BYU-Hawaii and pursued the next phases of your life. Frequently we speak about President McKay's prophetic vision of you in terms of "learners, leaders, and builders. " Today I would like to speak about your going forth to become builders - builders of strong homes and faithful families; builders of strong communities and successful careers; and builders of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>I love the counsel given by Elder Bruce R. McConkie regarding your charge to be builders. Speaking at general conference, he said,</p>
<p>"Every person born into this world builds a house of some sort and puts it on a foundation of his choosing. And every house built in this mortal sphere is subject to the storms and strifes of life. Our mortal probation is one in which the divine purpose calls for rain and winds and floods. We live in the midst of a swirling storm of sin. The rains of evil and the winds of false doctrine and the floods of carnality beat upon every house. [But] it is within our power to build a house of faith, a house of righteousness, a house of salvation" (Bruce R. McConkie, Ensign, May 1981, "Upon This Rock").</p>
<p>At this special time of commencement I would like to share three principles that we hope will be hallmarks of your life of building.  While each of you has already contributed much to the building of your education and character, the future will require that you take on even greater challenges in your efforts to build a life filled with the peace and joy the Savior has promised.</p>
<p>The <strong>first principle</strong> I'd stress is that of <strong>creating and maintaining a firm foundation</strong>.  A foundation built on rock and not on sand (Matthew 7:24-27). A foundation that will prove sufficient for all the Lord has in store for you. A foundation that "cannot fall" (David B. Haight, General Conference, April 1972, "A Foundation Whereon Men Cannot Fall"). And the scriptures make it abundantly clear that the only sure foundation is one built on the Savior and His gospel.</p>
<p>Our hope is that your time at BYU-Hawaii has provided you with the opportunity to establish deep footings for both a spiritual and a temporal foundation.  Much like our new on-campus building sites, which are currently "settling" before we start preparing and pouring the footings and the foundations, we hope that you have become settled and anchored securely and soundly in learning by experience and by faith.</p>
<p>But we also know that you will need to nurture, refine, and strengthen that foundation going forward.  You will need to do so by making and keeping sacred covenants, by seeking the Lord's help daily, by following the Lord's prophets, by living worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and by serving faithfully and willingly in all you are called to do.</p>
<p>The <strong>second principle</strong> is making sure that you are always <strong>building for eternity</strong>.  I love the motto of the Church College of New Zealand, "Build now for eternity. " Whenever the prophet Joseph Smith was asked by the saints how permanently they should build their homes, he responded, "Build as though you were going to stay forever" (Joseph B. Wirthlin, New Era, March 1990, "Build It Right"). Building for eternity ensures that the quality of the materials - the ideas, values and character - you use in whatever you build will be worthy of your good name and reputation and the talents with which the Lord has blessed you.</p>
<p>And this principle is true whether building a career or a business, establishing an eternal home and family, or helping to build the kingdom in some far corner of the world.  Indeed if you commit to and follow this second principle in all you do, then when circumstances, associates or the honors of men would tempt you to compromise or lower your standards, like the prophet Nehemiah of old, you will be able to respond, "I am doing a great work, I cannot come down" (Nehemiah 6:3).</p>
<p>When you follow this principle of "building for eternity," the Lord can enhance and magnify your efforts far beyond what you might have envisioned for yourself.  &nbsp;I've always appreciated the way in which the Christian writer, C.S. Lewis, described the result when we follow this principle.  He said:&nbsp;"Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right, and stopping the leaks in the roof, and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts . . . and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to?</p>
<p>"The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of- throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace" (Lewis, C. S. , Mere Christianity (London: William Collins, 1970), 172).</p>
<p>The <strong>third principle</strong> of building I would share is what is referred to in the scriptures as "<strong>fitly framed</strong>" (Ephesians 2:21). When constructing a physical building, this is what ensures that all of the elements are tied together and that the building has integrity. This is the characteristic that is needed if physical buildings are to have sufficient structural integrity and resilience to withstand earthquakes, tornedoes, hurricanes, typhoons and other natural disasters.</p>
<p>When building an aspect of your personal life - whether a marriage, a family, a career, a community, or the kingdom - this principle enables each aspect both individually and collectively to withstand every challenge. By being "fitly framed," each aspect of your life is tied to that sure foundation which cannot fail whatever storms or circumstances may come. As you hear the Savior's words received through His prophets and the promptings of the Holy Ghost, and bind yourself to Him and His gospel, you will be fitly framed and will merit all that He has promised.</p>
<p>We have great faith in you and in your future. Our hope at this time of commencement is that you will go forth committed to build on that sure foundation of Jesus Christ, consistently build for eternity, and through your thoughts and actions, all aspects of your life will be fitly framed and tied to that foundation. Let me conclude my remarks by echoing the closing words of King Benjamin to those he loved so dearly:</p>
<p>". . .remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer. . . that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,. . . when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you. . . because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall" (Helaman 5:12).</p>
<p>I testify that these are true principles and that they will lead you to peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media120403<br><title>Diligence in Keeping the Commandments: A Key to Blessings, Protection and Happiness | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>April 3, 2012<br />J. Alan Walker<br />President<br />Waipahu Hawaii Stake<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha. As I was pondering over what I should share with you today, my thoughts were directed to the occasional tendency some of us have to be casual in our observance of the commandments of God and casual in our adherence to the counsel provided from our Heavenly Father through his prophets, seers, and revelators. As I contemplated upon this concern the Spirit confirmed to me that this is what I should focus on during my time with you today.</p>
<p>First, let me start with the big picture. I always find it helpful to start with a macro view. Knowing the why's behind what we are asked to do can help inspire us to do that which is required.</p>
<p>We are all literal spirit children of a loving Father in heaven. We lived with our Father in the preexistence. Our Father is perfect in every way. We longed to be like him.</p>
<p>Our Father held a grand council in the preexistence. You and I were all there. At this council our Father provided a great and wonderful plan that furnished a way for us to become like him. The plan required we be separated from Him, receive a physical body, and prove ourselves so that we could progress and achieve perfect happiness, like our Heavenly Father. It would not be easy, but a way was provided for us to succeed. Heavenly Father promised a Savior to help us overcome two obstacles we could not overcome on our own; physical death and sin. Our eldest spirit brother, Jesus Christ, volunteered to fulfill the role of Savior. Sadly, one-third of our brothers and sisters rejected this plan and chose to follow Satan, but we accepted the plan and have this opportunity to come to Earth, receive a physical body, and start an eternal family. If we do all that is required of us, through the Atonement of the Savior and through his merits alone, we will qualify for and ultimately receive eternal life; life that our Father enjoys, and this includes the blessings of an eternal family. This is perfect happiness. It is for this pursuit of happiness that we are here in mortality.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father allowed opposition so that we could choose righteousness and prove ourselves. Satan and the evil spirits that followed him were cast out to this earth. They cannot have joy and are continuously miserable. Their only desire and purpose is to make us miserable. In 2 Nephi 2:27 we learn . . .</p>
<p>"Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself (2 Nephi 2:27)."</p>
<p>Satan and his evil followers can influence us if we allow them to. They are very clever and very real. Satan has found that he can keep us from our purpose of life if he can fool us into not doing the things required of us to achieve true happiness. When he succeeds in doing so Satan leads us down forbidden paths that result in misery not happiness.</p>
<p>We should frequently review the plan of happiness because doing so helps us keep an eternal perspective. When we know and remember who we are and why we are here, we are more likely to keep our focus on the true purpose for our mortal probation. It will help us see the devil's lies for what they are. It is that perspective that we must have to successfully keep the commandments and do all that is required to qualify for eternal life.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father has given us many helps to assist us along the path back to Him. We need all of the blessings and protections He is willing to bless us with to accomplish our mortal objective. During these latter-days prior to the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior it has become even more crucial to have those blessings. Wickedness abounds. The pace of preparation has been quickened. When I sit in church councils I can see and feel the change in the pace of the work. I do not know when the Second Coming will occur, but I do know that we are getting closer and I know that the prophesied calamities and difficulties prior to the Second Coming are real. It will get worse. We need to secure all the help we can to be victorious. In 2 Timothy 3:1 we are taught  "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."</p>
<p>Then, in D&amp;C 39:21 we discover "For the time is at hand; the day or the hour no man knoweth; but it surely shall come."</p>
<p>I do not say this to be an alarmist. I share this only to emphasize just how important the protections and blessings of the Lord are to those who are faithful. It is my desire that you and I take advantage of those protections and blessings and it is with this purpose that I carry this message. We must not be casual in our observance of the commandments of God. We must not be casual in our adherence to the counsel of prophets, seers, and revelators. We must, instead, be diligent in this cause. This warning is found in D&amp;C 97:25 -26, "Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her. But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire."</p>
<p>What do I mean by casual observance? The Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary defines the word casual as "occurring without regularity; occasional; feeling or showing little concern; and nonchalant." Meanwhile, the word diligent is described by Merriam Webster as "characterized by steady, earnest, and energetic effort." I testify that casual observance of the commandments will not bring about the necessary blessings and protections we so desperately need to survive spiritually. It is not sufficient to allow us to do what is required so that we can qualify for the blessings of Eternal Life, Exaltation, and Eternal Families. Casual observance is dangerous and will lead to forbidden paths and ultimately destruction. The Lord wants us to be diligent and he is not happy with a half-hearted effort as evidenced in this declaration in Revelations 3:15-16:</p>
<p>"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth."</p>
<p>Haphazard compliance to the commandments will result in rejection from the Lord if we do not repent. Now, I like to envision our loving Heavenly Father watching over us and anxiously observing us behind the windows of heaven. There He holds an abundance of blessings and protections that He desires to pour out upon us, but he will not unless we choose to turn the key and unlock those windows to allow our Father in Heaven to pour out those blessings. I liken the turning of those keys to the diligent keeping of His commandments. The Lord's promise to the diligent is clear in D&amp;C 59:4 . . .</p>
<p>"And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time:they that are faithful and diligent before me."</p>
<p>We need to turn that key; we need to be more diligent in our keeping each and every commandment.</p>
<p>We sometimes have the tendency to think of commandments as restrictive; as a barrier to freedom. This is one of the lies the adversary employs to try and get us from taking advantage of what Heavenly Father has provided for us. Commandments are for our benefit. We secure freedom and we are blessed when we keep the commandments. Let me share with you an analogy.</p>
<p>Traffic lights; we are familiar with the frustration we experience while driving to a destination and we come to a red light. It is not fun to have to sit for a minute or so while we wait for that light to turn green. We might momentarily wish that the traffic light was banished forever. After all, we may think, without this red light I would be much further along in my journey. However, the reality is that traffic lights are for our benefit. If these stop lights are removed, pandemonium rules, traffic backs up, and our journey becomes much more dangerous and takes much longer. I experienced this exact phenomenon on the morning of the Hawaii earthquake in October 2006. You may recall that that earthquake took place on an early Sunday morning and set off a series of events that resulted in a power outage that lasted many long hours throughout almost the entire island of Oahu. This included a loss of electricity needed to run traffic lights. None of theses crucial traffic lights functioned throughout Oahu for most of that day. When the earthquake occurred I was attending our stake presidency meeting in the Waipahu Hawaii Stake Center. After enduring the shaking of the stake center, assessing the situation, and deciding to cancel church meetings throughout the stake on that day, we closed our presidency meeting and each member of the presidency began their drive back home. My drive was a relatively short 6-mile journey from the stake center in Waipahu to my home in Ewa Beach, but it required passing through a series of congested street crossings normally governed by a system of stop lights. That drive generally takes around 15 minutes, but can take up to 20 minutes if one is unlucky and catches several red lights. However, on this morning, without the assistance of stop lights, that drive took nearly an hour. Each intersection was backed up as vehicles from all four directions cautiously inched their way across each crossing street. Several cars refused to follow courtesy rules and this resulted in fender bender accidents. It was utter chaos. That day, I became very grateful for traffic lights.</p>
<p>So it is with the commandments of God. They exist to bless us, and they provide us with freedoms, but when we are not diligent or faithful in the keeping of commandments, we are on dangerous ground because we do not qualify for the fullness of blessings and protections that God promises us in turn for keeping those commandments. Remember the words of the Lord in D&amp;C 82:10, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise."</p>
<p>The adversary desires that we be complacent and casual in the observance of commandments. He knows that will limit our blessings and protections and when we are in such a condition, we are in his power. Satan has found that he has more success in leading us down the path of destruction through the use of little lies. One of his favorite tools, especially when striving to thwart the progress of members of the Church, is to fool us in to believing that a casual observance of the laws, commandments, and counsels of our prophets, seers, and revelators is sufficient. He lulls us into thinking that "all is well" and then snatches us with his chains when it is too late. In 2 Nephi 28:21, 24, and 25, we are instructed: "And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well:and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion! Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!"</p>
<p>So what must we do? Since these blessings come as a result of strict, consistent, and diligent obedience to the laws and commandments of God we should be exact, faithful, and consistent in keeping all of the commandments to avail ourselves of these protections and blessings. Throughout the Book of Mormon, God promises that if we keep his commandments we will prosper.</p>
<p>Today, to help illustrate the importance of exact obedience to the commandments, I want to focus on a single commandment that the world, and even many in the Church, consider very lightly, and in many cases have completely forsaken. It is a commandment that has mighty blessings and protections associated with it, and it is precisely because of that fact that Satan attacks it with ferocious intensity. He despises this commandment and desires that no one qualify for the wonderful blessings and protections associated with the diligent keeping of this commandment. He has been so successful in his assault that most of the world no longer partakes of the blessings and protections that God desires to pour out upon us but that are conditional on our faithful observance of that law. What law is this? It is the Law of the Sabbath. Our first record of this commandment comes from Exodus 20:8: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."</p>
<p>Here Heavenly Father set up the Law of the Sabbath not only as a commandment but as a symbol of His covenant people. This is shown in Exodus 31:13 and 16 "Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant."</p>
<p>There was a time not too long ago that most of Christianity was faithful in the observance of this commandment. It may seem strange to many of you here, but it was only a handful of decades ago that most businesses in North America closed on Sundays, and most Christians attended church. Today, that is no longer the case. Unfortunately, this same pattern can be observed within the membership of the Church. Many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are beginning to follow the ways of the world and becoming casual in their observance of this and many other of God's commandments. Some feel justified in their casual attitude toward this commandment by claiming that it is no longer applicable to us. Some believe that this is an outdated commandment associated only with the ancient house of Israel. However, this notion is false. In our times the Lord has once again emphasized the importance of keeping the Sabbath Day holy. Through the prophet Joseph Smith He has revealed that we are to keep that commandment.</p>
<p>"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy" (D&amp;C 68:29).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord has revealed that there are wonderful blessings associated with the faithful observance of the Sabbath Day. In the 59th section of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants we learn the following:</p>
<p>"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;</p>
<p>"For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High;</p>
<p>"Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times;</p>
<p>" But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.</p>
<p>"And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full."</p>
<p>Then in verse 16 and 17 we are promised . . .</p>
<p>"Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth;</p>
<p>"Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards;" (D&amp;C 59:9-17).</p>
<p>This scripture reveals magnificent promises to those who keep this commandment. We are promised that we can be kept unspotted from the world. Our environment is becoming increasingly wicked. If we are to pass this test of mortality, we must remain clean from sin, or unspotted, but that is becoming so difficult to do with all of the evil that is rising around us. These scriptures promise that if we keep the Sabbath Day holy we will be more "fully kept unspotted from the world". That fact alone should be sufficient motivation to keep this sacred commandment. But, there is more. We are also promised that the fullness of the earth will be ours. We are promised that we will be granted what we need, "whether for food or for raiment, or for houses." We are also promised barns, orchards, gardens, and vineyards. Now, many of you may see no need for these things. However, please remember that when this commandment was given the primary source of meeting the physical and temporal needs for oneself and ones family was through farming. So, when I hear this, I hear a promise that God will provide us with the means to provide for our temporal needs. Today, we may not provide through family farms and fields, but I believe the observance of this great commandment could be the difference between being employed or being unemployed.</p>
<p>I came to realize the truth of this promise through personal experiences I have had through keeping the Sabbath Day holy. To illustrate the importance of diligence versus casual observance in keeping the commandments, let me share with you my personal experience with the Sabbath Day.</p>
<p>Following my graduation from BYU Hawaii in 1991, and after a one-year period of full-time work experience at the Polynesian Cultural Center, I decided to pursue a Masters degree in Business Administration. I applied and was accepted into the Business School at the University of Hawaii Manoa. I commenced my master's studies in September 1992. The MBA program at Manoa is tailored for those with full-time employment. Classes were held in the evenings Mondays through Thursdays from 6:00 pm until 8:30 pm. When I started this two-and-a-half year program, I decided that I would try to continue to work full-time as a sales manager for the PCC while studying as a full-time student. I had classes every evening Monday through Thursday. After class, I would study at home, study all evening on Friday after work, and I studied most of Saturday and on Sundays after I completed church meetings. My schedule was extremely demanding. I can remember feeling tremendous pressure and struggling to keep all of my commitments at work, school, church, and to my wife. I had very little time for anything else and my only "personal" time was watching sports on Sunday after church and before studying. At that time, you could clearly classify my observance of the Law of the Sabbath as casual and not diligent. While growing up, television had been a part of my Sundays. I learned to really keep the Sabbath Day holy while serving a full-time mission, but soon after my return I found television once again entering into my Sabbath Day patterns. You see, I loved to watch sports and especially football. I thought of it as a way to let go of steam; a method of relaxation, and hey, there a plenty of Mormons in the NFL right? Surely God is a fan too? So for this first semester in the master's program at Manoa, when I wasn't sleeping or eating, I was either at work, in class, studying, in church, or watching sports on Sunday. Well, I struggled tremendously in my classes that first semester, and my grades were not what I wanted them to be. I knew that something had to change. It just was not working. So after counseling with my wife I decided to approach my boss at work and ask if I could change from full-time hours to part-time hours at least until I completed my studies at the University of Hawaii. I thought that by reducing my work load I would have the additional hours of study needed to bring up my grades to where I wanted them to be. So with that mindset I approached my boss with my request. He told me he was willing to accommodate my schedule by changing my status from full-time to part-time, but before so doing wanted me to make another try at one more semester as a full-time employee and full-time student. "Just give it one more shot," was his challenge." If it does not work, then we will make the change to part-time status." It was not the answer I had hoped for but I promised to try to make it work for at lease another semester. One Sunday, shortly thereafter, things changed forever. My first semester had just ended, and I was relishing the freedom from classes and studying that came with Christmas break. Yet I knew that a new year and a new semester was just around the corner. I was not looking forward to another round of full-time work and full-time school. Well that Sunday after church, I enjoyed some exciting football games on television.  After the games ended, I made my way from our bedroom to the living room of our apartment to find my wife behind one of her softback Japanese mystery novels. This is what she likes to do when I watch football. I don't know what took a hold of me, but suddenly I found myself in a "preaching" mood and I quipped, "You know, you really should not be reading books like that on Sunday." There was a pause, and then my wife peered up at me from the pages of her book to reply, "Well, you know, you really should not watch football on Sundays." When she said those words something happened to me. I was stunned. It felt as if she had take a wooden board and wacked me over the head with it. How dare I tell her what to do on Sundays when I was not even doing what I was suppose to do. Something stirred within me. I pondered on what I was doing. I then said something that even surprised me. I told my sweetheart, "Alright. I will give up watching football on Sundays if you give up those books on Sundays." Apparently, this also surprised my wife, and her first response was something like, "yeah right!" But, to this I stated, "No, I mean it; I will give it up." She could tell I was serious and responded, "Well, then, if you give up football on Sundays, I will give up these books on Sundays too." And so it began. It was not easy for me, but with my wife's help we made the effort to fill Sundays with activities that uplifted and inspired; that showed respect for the Lord, and that directed our thoughts toward Him. As winter break came to an end I realized that if I was really going to make an effort to keep the Sabbath Day holy, I would also need to give up studying on Sundays, and I decided that was what I would do. With that determination, I would have fewer study hours and I knew that I would now have to certainly switch to part-time work. I had struggled tremendously during my first semester and that was with multiple hours of study on Sunday. So, to my boss I went, I explained to him my commitment to keep the Sabbath Day holy and once again pleaded with him to allow me to change to part-time. My courses would become increasingly more challenging, I explained, and I needed the extra hours each week for study. Part-time employment seemed to be the only answer. But, to my surprise I received the same counsel. "No. I want you to try full-time employment and full-time student status a little longer." I knew it would not work. It could not work. It was impossible. But, once again, I obliged. 1993 began the same way 1992 had ended; a full course load at school and full-time hours at work. The only difference was that I was now keeping the Sabbath Day holy and doing so by eliminating Sunday study. I braced myself for the worse. But here is where the miracle occurred. Brothers and Sisters, I never did change to part-time employment. I continued with full-time course loads, and I did so without studying on Sundays. I kept the Sabbath Day holy. My wife and I strived to fulfill that commandment. AND, I do not share the following to brag. That is not my intent whatsoever. I only share this to show the blessings that come from God when we are faithful in the keeping of commandments. I want to show that when we do our part, we have promise. God will always come through. You see, from that semester forward until I graduated with my master's degree two years later in December of 1994, somehow, someway, I scored straight A's in every single class. How is that possible? I had much fewer hours of studying per week, and yet I found myself better able to comprehend the course study, better able to absorb class lectures, better able to study, retain, and retrieve what I had learned. My pen flowed when I wrote papers. My mind functioned clearly when I took exams. I knew it was because of the blessings of the Lord, because the Spirit confirmed to me that this blessing came not only because of diligent study, but more importantly because of faithful obedience in keeping the Sabbath Day holy. What a powerful experience. I truly came to know for myself the truth in the promise in D&amp;C 59.</p>
<p>"Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth;</p>
<p>"Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards;" (D&amp;C 59:16-17).</p>
<p>This is not all. More important than success in school, I found a powerful change in my spirituality. Sundays became much sweeter to me. Where I had once loathed Sundays, knowing that I HAD to go to church, and knowing that I HAD to do this and do that, now, I looked forward to the Sabbath Day. I found myself much more spiritually edified, and I found myself much more refreshed and ready for a new week when Monday rolled around. I was reenergized and refreshed both spiritually and physically through obedience of an ancient but sacred law of God. Is this not in part what the Lord meant when He said in Matthew 10:39, "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."</p>
<p>To this day, I find that even when Sundays are very busy for me because of my current calling, as long as I keep the Sabbath Day holy, I find myself refreshed and ready for a new week when Mondays come. This is truly a blessing derived by keeping the Sabbath Day holy. Brothers and Sisters, this was a pivotal point in my life. Things changed dramatically for me. My priorities became more in line with what is required for me to return to my Heavenly Father. It has brought great blessings upon my family. Keeping this commandment has provided spiritual strength and spiritual protection. When I think back to that Sunday in late 1992, I can only but thank the Lord for that spiritual two-by-four over the head; and I thank the Lord for a wonderful sweetheart who was inspired enough to say what she did to wake me from my deep spiritual slumber. I am reminded of the following scripture in Jacob 3:11 . . .</p>
<p>"O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death."</p>
<p>When we are diligent in keeping God's laws we are immediately and abundantly blessed. In this wicked world we need every protection and every blessing God has in store for us. This example and my story illustrate the blessings of only one law. However, I remind you that the law of the fast, the law of tithes and offerings, the law of frequent heartfelt prayer, the law of daily scripture study, the law of the word of wisdom, the law of frequent temple worship, and all laws of God are also associated with great blessings and protections that we require to survive our probation on Earth. We need all of the associated blessing and protections that come via diligent observance of all of Father in Heaven's commandments. I warn you that Satan will use all of his forces to try and convince you that casual observance of these laws and the counsel of prophets will suffice. I warn you that this is a lie and that the casual following of Gospel principles will not be enough. I challenge you to put the Lord to test. Borrowing from Malachi 3:10, I emphasize the promise of the Lord that He will prove to you that those who are faithful will be blessed.</p>
<p>" . . . prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven , and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it."</p>
<p>I promise you that you can gain a personal testimony of each and every law. That testimony will come as you live the law and experience what Alma of old taught of feeling it swell within your hearts and experiencing the blessings that come. You will come to know for yourself that it is right and that it is good, and the Holy Spirit will confirm to you that those blessing come as a result of your diligent obedience. You will see the contrast between casual observance and faithful obedience. Diligent obedience will bless your life and lives of your family members throughout this mortal probation and in to the eternities. You will bless the day that you decided to put the Lord to the test. May you do that, and may the happiness that will result in this life and the life to come be yours is my humble prayer. I testify that these things are true. I know of these things myself because the Lord has shown it to me and because the Spirit has confirmed it to me. This witness is available to all. Let us always remember the Lord's counsel in D&amp;C 30:8:</p>
<p>"Wherefore, give heed unto these things and be diligent in keeping my commandments, and you shall be blessed unto eternal life."</p>
<p>In the name of Him who we serve and to whom we owe all, the Savior of the World, even Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>March 27, 2012<br />Sidney R. Henderson<br />University Chaplain &amp; Missionary<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, Aloha.</p>
<p>Sister Henderson and I so treasure our time at Brigham Young University where we studied, met, and were married. It is an honor to share our testimonies with you this morning.</p>
<p>As Chaplain on campus, I interview on the phone, those who are not members of the Church who want to come to school here. I have met marvelous young people around the world. Recently I reviewed an essay from an applicant from the United States before I made a call to interview her. With her permission and changing names and places, I want to share it with you:</p>
<p>"Everyone has setbacks. My setback isn't very original since it seems like many parents these days get divorced. It's sad to think that there are only a few people I know with parents that are still together. My parents divorced when I was about five years old. At the time, I thought my dad would be back in just a couple of days, but as I got older I realized my parents would never get back together. I grew up in Flagstaff my whole life, but when they separated my dad went to live in Denver, and never came back. Growing up I went back and forth from Flagstaff to Denver.</p>
<p>"On breaks I would visit my dad and meet him halfway in a little town called Fruita between Wendy's and McDonald's. In that parking lot, a lot of tears were shed knowing I would be leaving one parent to be with another. The older I got, the more responsibilities I gained and the harder it was to visit my dad. I feel like I missed out on precious moments that could have been spent with my dad."</p>
<p>I then called this young woman and we became acquainted. We talked about her sad essay. I wanted her to understand something about the spirit of BYU-Hawaii. She had visited the PCC before and remembered the beautiful temple on the hill. I said, "Did you know the temple is closed on Sundays? We don't hold church there."</p>
<p>"Then what is it for?" she asked.</p>
<p>"It's where we perform weddings." I responded. We had talked earlier about the Honor Code, the law of chastity and other important parts of LDS culture on our campus. I said, "Marriage is very important to members of our faith. Many students at BYU-Hawaii date and get married. And when they marry they do it in the temple." I explained that in the temple, "We do not marry for just this life, but also for eternity. There, we are promised by the authority of God, to be sweethearts forever and that our children will always be ours if we keep God's commandments. We believe that marriage for time and eternity is part of God's plan for happiness."</p>
<p>"That is beautiful," she said. I could tell she was touched.</p>
<p>I am grateful my family life has been so different from what this young lady has known. I grew up in a home that was a lot like heaven. Oh, there were set backs, challenges and the need for repentance. But I grew up in a happy home. And the home that Sister Henderson mostly created for us was surely a bit of heaven. Why was that? How have we escaped Satan and his plan of misery and unhappiness that he is wrecking across the earth? It is because my parents and Sister Henderson and I have tried to follow the words of the living prophets who are showing us the way.</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer has said,</p>
<p>The crisis of the family is no surprise to the Church. We have certainly known what was coming. I know of no better testimony that prophets lead us than our preparation for this present emergency. (1)</p>
<p>Yes, can you see the hand of our prophets, guiding us through a huge crisis and emergency of family destruction? I was blessed by a father who carefully taught me the words of the prophets and about being a priesthood holder in the home. He said to me, "You know... you do not have to go to hell to know what it is like. Hell may be no worse than an unhappy home." And then he said, "And... you may never be closer to heaven than on the floor playing with your children at home." Can you feel that eternal marriage and love at home are keys to your happiness? The proclamation on the family begins:</p>
<p>We, THE FIRST PRESIDENCY and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children. (2)</p>
<p>Family is part of the divine plan of happiness... Your happiness. Some of you have started your own families, many of you will soon, and some will patiently wait for a season. But I bear you my testimony that living the principles of family happiness as taught by the prophets will bless us all, no matter our current status. Today, I would like to leave with you three keys that Sister Henderson and I have learned over the years:</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>As you prepare for an eternal marriage or are building a stronger marriage, will you please take care of yourselves? When I was sixteen, and discovering how important girls were in my life, my father invited me to go with him to girl's camp. We went early one summer morning to take food supplies. WOW... girl's camp where there were two hundred girls my age from our stake. I knew most of them and there were no other boys.</p>
<p>It was still dark when we arrived way up in the mountains and pine trees of their encampment. Quietly, we began to carry boxes of food to the kitchen area. We smelled bacon and eggs cooking for that army of girls, but none were in sight. Then I heard music. The Beatles were my thing then but this was quite different. I could not make it out but it was far away and seemed to go straight to my heart. I stopped and hid behind a tree, as the singing seemed to surround me and get louder. Then I saw. Each camp of girls was coming down to breakfast. They came down the paths from every direction, singing primary songs and it was very special and beautiful. I watched from my hiding place. And then my Heavenly Father opened my eyes and mind to something I had not realized before. I knew these girls. Some were tall, some short. Some had long brown hair and some short blond. But like words in my mind I heard, "Sid, these are all mine. They are all my daughters and they are all beautiful and precious to me. To each one I have endowed or shared my power, the unspeakable power to create bodies for my children." I was stunned at the thought. The power to create. Then the thoughts continued. "Sid, you must never speak lightly or joke about their bodies or their power to create. You must protect their virtue always. You must treat them all with respect and their sacred powers with reverence." Now I was in tears. "If you do as I say, one day you may be worthy to take one of them to my holy temple and to become an eternal partner with her."</p>
<p>This experience changed my life. Dating was different after that, and I became more serious about preparing for a mission.</p>
<p>Remember the doctrine of opposition in all things from Second Nephi? There are choices and consequences in all things: light or darkness; freedom from sin or bondage; happiness or misery. On the one hand we have Satan,</p>
<p>"...because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind." (3)</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have the Father and the Son who appeared to 14 year-old Joseph and light and truth burst forth upon the earth in our day. The Savior's plan of happiness was to be restored in opposition to Satan's plan of misery. Moroni appeared to the boy prophet and taught the prophecy of Malachi, promising that Elijah the prophet would come:</p>
<p>"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly lost at his coming." (4)</p>
<p>Elijah did come in 1836 and gave the prophet the sealing powers to bind and seal on earth and in heaven. But, to seal what? Families. Because the sealing of families together for eternity is central to God's plan of happiness. But we must also note with soberness that Malachi then warned that if families are not bound and linked together by this priesthood power, then the purposes of the earth will be lost, our missions in life will have failed and Satan's plan of misery will win out. Elijah's coming was a great rescue mission for mankind. Joseph Smith later taught:</p>
<p>"How shall God come to the rescue of this generation? He will send Elijah the prophet. ... Elijah shall reveal the covenants to seal the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers."(5)</p>
<p>Satan is not just a guy who is a little mixed up... He is evil and committed to your misery. Sometimes we think the way he brings us down is to tempt us to steal the neighbor's apples or rob banks. While these are wrong, he knows the best way to make you miserable is to tempt you away from a happy and eternal family. And he does it oh, so carefully. With bright and fun images and music. Remember Laman and Lemuel making merry and light of sacred things on the deck of the ship? So, Satan steals away our youth with worldly movies, dress and drugs. Look out, precious youth! It is his cunning way to rob you of happy and eternal relationships. Please ...take care of yourselves.</p>
<p>Forty-two years ago, Sister Henderson and I knelt at a beautiful blue alter in a small room in the Manti temple. The temple president asked us to look into his eyes as he pronounced words too sacred to repeat here. Through the sealing authority of the holy priesthood, he bound us on earth and sealed us in eternity as husband and wife, if we would be faithful to God and each other. We then stood and he asked us to hold hands and look into the mirrors that hung on opposite walls. There we saw the two of us in white, reflected a thousand times into infinity. We could not understand then as we do now, that the eternal reflections represented more than the two of us being together forever. Also represented in the mirrors were the eternal lives of children who were promised to us that awesome day.</p>
<p>And so it was. A year or so later, I stood at Joyce's bedside. She had spent a very painful night bringing our first son into the world. I held him in my arms and gazed in wonder at his perfect fingers, nose and tiny hands. He was magnificent. I looked at Joyce in amazement and said, "YOU HAVE DONE A MIRICLE!" And indeed she had. She was a daughter of God just as I had learned at girl's camp and He made her a partner with Him in creation. She gave a body to a spirit child fresh from God's presence. A body! A body that would one day be resurrected because of the great sacrifice of our Savior, "spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fullness of joy." (6) She gave our son a sacred body, a temple that would bring him the possibility of great joy.</p>
<p>I do not think we can overstate the sacredness of these gifts of procreation. Isn't heaven offended when we make light of these things? Brethren, you are charged to protect and defend God's daughters and the power or virtue you both hold to create life. Brothers and sisters, there is no place in your lives, before or after marriage to joke about these powers or to watch movies that depict intimacy or to dress in a way that tempts or that says you do not care. The Honor Code and dress code are not a strange set of rules or a costume to be worn at BYU. They are born of the temple and are the council of prophets to set a standard of reverence and protection for you all your life. When we see you around campus, in town or on the beach, not dressed as you have promised, it hurts. Heaven is hurt. We want to say with great love, "Remember who you are and please take care of yourself." You are playing with Heavenly Father's sacred gifts to you and are putting your happiness and the happiness of your eternal family at risk. Please, take care of yourselves.</p>
<p>Our second key:</p>
<p>Fill your home with love. How I struggled to learn Spanish on my mission. I had been out three months and still I was unable to help my companion. Early each morning, I got on my knees and pled for the gift of tongues I had been promised when I was set apart. I studied my heart out. Yet I could not speak Spanish.</p>
<p>Then one night, my companion who was the branch president got a phone call from a family in need. Soon we entered their apartment on the sixth floor of an old building in New York City. Never had I felt such darkness. Mother and father were shouting at each other and two little ones cried in fear. My father had been right. This was hell. My companion and I sat on the couch, without a clue of what to do.</p>
<p>Then warmth and an urging came over me. "Sid, you know what to say." I rebelled in my heart. "No I don't. I do not understand what they are yelling, I can't speak Spanish and I am the junior companion." Then... I was speaking. I am sure it was not great Spanish, but I was speaking and they were listening. I said, "Brother and Sister Vargas, Heavenly Father does not like fighting at home. I explained that in my home, when we needed to solve a problem, we prayed. I turned to Sister Vargas and invited her to pray. I slipped off the couch to my knees. My companion stared at me in disbelief.</p>
<p>"No," she said. "I can't pray now." I bowed my head, closed my eyes and waited. First there was silence, then tears as she began to pray. She apologized to the Lord and her husband for getting angry and for the words she had said. She asked the Spirit to return to their home. I then turned to the father and asked him to pray. His heart was hard and he was about to throw us out. But... he started to pray and his heart softened. Soon the children were holding tight to their parents and light had returned to that home.</p>
<p>Until this experience I had not realized that I never heard my parents raise their voice to each other or argue. They may have had disagreements but they never let us hear them. What mom said, Dad supported. And what Dad said, Mom respected. We were not allowed to fight each other as children. Mother would quickly show us how to resolve our differences. My parents were quick to apologize. My mother never spoke ill of my father to anyone. I never heard her say to a friend anything like, "Oh, I wish my husband were taller or I wish he liked to shop." Now... I do not believe this all came without work. They had decided to be one and to fill their home with love. You can do the same.</p>
<p>My father taught me that a priesthood holder's first responsibility was the well being of his wife and sweetheart. Oh, if men could be men and remember they must first care for their wives, the mother of their children. Mother was Dad's girl and we knew it by the way he treated her. It was never okay with Dad for us to offend Mom.</p>
<p>Mother taught me to pray at my bedside each night. As we gathered around the table to eat, it was our habit to pull the chairs out and have kneeling family prayer. I often felt a protecting hand over me, when I might have made a wrong decision, because my father had prayed for our safety that day.</p>
<p>So, our second key is that you must fill your homes with love. Practice now in your homes, in your wards, dorms and in all your associations.</p>
<p>Our third and last key is to prepare to teach your children light and truth.</p>
<p>As you become parents, the feelings of love and concern that I have expressed to you this morning will become yours for your own children. Your greatest worry will be that they might not take care of themselves and be stolen away by Satan from the plan of happiness and eternal relationships. The thought of one of them not being part of your eternal family will horrify you. As parents you will be frightened and feel helpless as you see Satan and his world deliberately focus on taking down your children: attacking the traditional family and its values; showing images on television, movies, and internet to cheapen the sacred intimacies of marriage; crude language in movies and on the street and the horrible drugs. I can tell you from real experience, you will plead with the Lord on your knees for your children that they will be safe and "take care of themselves."</p>
<p>I bear you my testimony that the Lord has prepared a way for parents. It was revealed to Noah to build a boat to save his family. The living prophets have told parents to hold family home evening to save their families today.</p>
<p>President Packer said:</p>
<p>"Thirty-three (now fifty) years ago the Brethren warned us of the disintegration of the family and told us to prepare. It was announced by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that the Church would be restructured.</p>
<p>"The weekly family home evening was introduced by the First Presidency who said that 'the home [is] the basis of a righteous life and ... no other instrumentality can take its place nor fulfill its essential functions...'" (1)</p>
<p>Family home evening comes with a promise from the modern prophets of protection for your children.</p>
<p>Often our family counseled together in family home evening. On one occasion, we were concerned about some of the music our children were playing. We opened the scriptures and also read the words from our prophet from conference. We wrote down on paper some of the words in their songs and asked how they felt about them. One said he had not heard the words. Another said the words felt really bad. We then asked what we should do? Without any help from us, they decided to throw the music away. But one said, "We paid a lot of money for these tapes." However they quickly came together deciding this music should not be in our home.</p>
<p>On another occasion, we decided which TV programs we would watch and that the rest of the time the TV would be off. It was not always easy, but we had decided as a family and this blessed our home.</p>
<p>We raised most of our children in a remote country and the closest temple was thousands of miles away. So, we had a huge painting done for our living room of the Washington D.C. temple. The kids began to call that room the temple room. There we would hold family home evening and we often sang, "High on a Mountain Top" because there were no mountains there. We had many discussions in our home about the importance of the mountain of the Lord, the temple and they wanted to go there.</p>
<p>Will you do the same in your family? Family home evening generally consists of the entire family taking part in fun and spiritual activities like opening and closing prayer, singing, a lesson, family council, and most important games and treats. Sometimes we would dance together, dramatic ballroom or rock'n roll. We especially liked it when one would perform on the piano, told about some important happening in their lives and we loved to sing fun songs together. Here is a picture of our oldest four singing Book of Mormon Stories.</p>
<p>Above all else, your children should hear and know frequently how their parents feel about them. They should hear your heart-felt testimony in the quiet of your home.</p>
<p>Here are our four older children posing for a picture during family home evening. Our favorite game was the sock-roll race. Each one was given a roll of stockings like this... Joyce and I and the children got on the floor in a line. The object was to push the roll using only your nose to the finish line on the other side of the room. One of my kids wrote recently that, "I suppose I loved this activity because we were all on the floor together. The big people were little people with us." There was lots of teasing and laughing. After a few races, it usually broke down into a tickling frenzy. I guess it was then I remembered my father's words, "You may never be closer to heaven than on the floor playing with your children at home."</p>
<p>Oh, please take care of yourselves so you will be worthy of these blessings. Fill your home with love. And please prepare to teach your children light and truth, especially in family home evening so that they will be ever yours.</p>
<p>I give you my quiet but sure witness that Jesus Christ created this earth and gave you a body for the great purpose of your happiness. He came to the earth and sacrificed his all to build a way of happiness for each of us. He sent prophets and priesthood keys to the earth in your day, these latter-days so that you and your children may have His plan of happiness. I bear you my testimony that central to that plan for your family is the Savior, Redeemer of the World, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen</p>

<p>March 20, 2012<br />Elder Kent D. Watson<br />Second Quorum of the Seventy<br />First Counselor Asia Area Presidency<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, Aloha. It is an honor for me to be able to return to BYU- Hawaii. Thank you President Wheelwright for inviting us.</p>
<p>Five years ago, it was my privilege to serve as a volunteer in the employment center here and also teach a class in accounting. I came to better understand the special privilege it is to be part of this marvelous university.</p>
<p>My journal from five years ago notes students in the accounting class named Khasherdene Bold, Aruiuneaa Buyantogtokh, Hui Chuan Chou, Soana Ta'ake Cocker, Nomura Domingo, Peijhih Fong, Elijah Kaka, Young Kyung Ko, Mei Sio Lam, Telusia Latu, Pok Man Lee, Sung Bok Lim, Temalisis Ma'u, Juniro Makise, Wisa Nantajak, Kahila Minora Numanga, Jung Won Oh, Krishn Kumar Prasad, Katoa Kakoa Sailusi, Takayuki Takagawa, Maruia Tauira, Goonjae Um, and Shuxiang Zhang.</p>
<p>They were from China, Chuuk, Fiji, Hawaii, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Macau, Mongolia, Somoa, Taiwan, Tonga, and Tavalu . Perhaps there could not have been a more diverse class with a more international flavor at any university on this planet.</p>
<p>Katoa was one of my favorite students. At the time, he was the only student in this university from Tuvalu. I was greatly embarrassed at my ignorance, as I had never heard of one of the smallest countries in the world with a population about the size of my hometown in rural Utah. Today Sister Watson and I make our home in Hong Kong where more people live in only one apartment block:more than the number of people living in Tuvalu.</p>
<p>Toa came to me to talk about his plans after graduation, asking where he should go. My answer at the time: "Go where you have the best opportunity." I have had five years to reflect upon that counsel. I now have additional perspective gained from further opportunities. Today, I would like to respond in a more thoughtful way to the question that Toa asked me five years ago:</p>
<p>Whither Shall I Go?</p>
<p>The question is not unusual. In an uncertain world, it is a question that each of us will ask and each of us will need to answer. It is interesting to me that there are several key decisions we make when we are seemingly least experienced. Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve calls them turning points in life and quotes Sir Winston Churchill:</p>
<p>Those "sharp agate points, on which the ponderous balance of destiny turns,"  They make all the difference in our lives if we get it right when we ponder, "What comes next?"</p>
<p>Here are a few examples for BYU-Hawaii students. Perhaps you have made some of the choices already.</p>
<p>Should I serve a mission?<br />What will be my choice of study?<br />What will be my choice of work or profession? How will I support my family?<br />Where shall I live:for most BYU Hawaii students, even in which country?<br />Whom should I marry? When will I be able to afford to have children?<br />What will be my response when invited to accept a Church calling?<br />And, this most penetrating question: Do I intend to keep all of God's commandments?</p>
<p>Due to age and generation differences, I may not be the best qualified to address some critical turning points in your era. On the other hand, answers to some key questions will always be the same and 50 years of experience might be beneficial to you.</p>
<p>Let me reflect on a few generational differences. When I was in college, computing was something new. One machine filled an entire room. When I began my career, there was no such thing as a personal computer. The electric typewriter was our most complex tool. We did not have copy machines or printers. We had carbon paper. The internet was barely a dream. We could not even imagine all-in-one hand-held devices. Social media was not in our vocabulary.</p>
<p>I worked for the same employer for 35 years. I was fiercely loyal to my firm:and my firm was very loyal to me. That type of loyalty has changed. In today's market place, employment has become much more portable. Employers do not feel that same loyalty toward their employees. Likewise, employees frequently change jobs and are no longer able or willing to give long-term loyalty to their employers.</p>
<p>I realize each day how technology and other things have accelerated, creating broad possibilities for each of you, along with many choices and an amazing array of opportunities.</p>
<p>There are some constants, however:actually eternal principles that are unchanging and can help us answer the question that Toa asked me five years ago, "Whither Shall I Go?" May I share six:</p>
<p>First, be obedient:keep all of the commandments and be "reconciled unto Christ"</p>
<p>The Israelites were taught this as a condition to entering the Promised Land.</p>
<p>"Keep all of the commandments...that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land&nbsp;<strong>whither ye go</strong> to possess it...if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments...to love the Lord...and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul...I will give you the rain of your land in his due season."</p>
<p>Soon after Lehi and his family arrived in the land of Bountiful, the Lord spake unto Nephi saying: "Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner that I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters." Nephi"™s response was interesting. He did not ask why or seek clarification about where they would end up after crossing the waters. His direct response to the Lord was:</p>
<p>"Lord whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me? And it came to pass that the Lord told me <strong>whither I should go</strong>."</p>
<p>Later, when Nephi had lived a lifetime of obedience and had been a great influence upon his people, he taught, "...for none of these can I have hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the straight path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation."</p>
<p>For college students of every generation, the greatest benefit from being reconciled to Christ by keeping God's commandments is that you will surely receive promised blessings. Personal direction and guidance are portions of those blessings. Our Heavenly Father keeps His promises.</p>
<p>In today's world, your LDS values are what employers seek in an employee. From my experience as an employer, I can assure you that LDS values are highly marketable. For many years, it was my opportunity as an employer to recruit entry-level college graduates:both in the US and in China.</p>
<p>On thousands of resumes, I have seen a wide range of experiences creatively listed by young people who hoped their experience would be most valued.</p>
<p>One had deep experience as a sanitation engineer. In other words, he had a night job on campus cleaning lavatories.</p>
<p>One had been a retail representative, meaning they had worked at the MacDonald's drive-through window.</p>
<p>Or how about a waste removal officer; meaning emptying garbage cans.</p>
<p>There was one frequently listed experience that raised an eyebrow among associates: Full-time humanitarian service volunteer for two years. The inevitable question was "what is a humanitarian service volunteer?" One applicant replied, "Well, I supervised 14 other service volunteers and I speak fluent Chinese."</p>
<p>My question to these applicants was always, "why didn't you say you learned to speak Chinese as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan and that you were a zone leader?" Your values as a Latter-day Saint are what an employer is looking for. They are marketable. Anything I ever achieved professionally can be directly attributed to my service as a missionary. It is the most valuable bullet point on my resume.</p>
<p>I like this quote from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland:</p>
<p>"Live the gospel as conspicuously as you can."</p>
<p>Always be proud of the fact that you were, and that you are worthy to be, a missionary representing The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It may just be the most important experience citation on your resume.</p>
<p>Now second, if I were responding to Toa today, I would invite him to follow the pattern that the Lord has set for us, which is to</p>
<p>Pray earnestly:with real intent, having faith. Be diligent as you inquire of your Heavenly Father where you should go. That is what the brother of Jared did when he was asked to</p>
<p>"Go and inquire of the Lord...<strong>whither shall we go</strong>." And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the brother of Jared and had compassion upon him. He said, "I will go before thee...and there will I bless thee and thy seed."</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks tells of a turning point that occurred in his life when, as a young hard working associate in a law firm, he was called to be a stake missionary. It was explained to him that this calling would require forty hours of proselyting per month in addition to other meetings and would take three to four evenings per week. With faith, he accepted the call. He discovered that by responding to a Church calling,</p>
<p>"I received no reduction in my accomplishments or advancement in my firm. Indeed, my success in my work and advancement in the firm seemed to accelerate rather than decline."</p>
<p>The Lord has promised: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." Surely, it is then that we can know from on high, even by the Comforter,<strong> whither we shall go.</strong></p>
<p>Fifth, Honor your parents and be loyal to your family</p>
<p>Remember, in any critical decision regarding where you should go, it is not about you. The prophet Nephi provides a wonderful example. During a very difficult time his brothers criticized him because he had broken his steel bow, their bows had lost their spring, and they had no way to obtain food. Even his father murmured.</p>
<p>Yet Nephi honored his father. "I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food? And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord."</p>
<p>I have the privilege of serving with a great Church leader from Indonesia, Subandriyo. He joined the Church as a young man. He is from a poor home without many of the material things of this life. When Subandriyo fell in love with Steffi, he went to ask her mother if they could marry. He had no money, nothing for a traditional wedding party. But this is the promise he made to Steffi's mother. "I have no money for a wedding, but I promise you that I will make your daughter the happiest woman on earth and I will always take care of her." He has kept that promise.</p>
<p>In my own life, it was my good fortune to have met Connie while I was still in college. We married and were blessed with a beautiful daughter when we were still in school. We had barely enough money to pay our bills. Our baby slept on a pillow in a cardboard box and we slept on a mattress on the floor. Following graduation, our first purchase after a few months of saving was to buy a bed for our daughter. The floor was good enough for us. The baby crib lasted for five wonderful children. We are now in our 45th year together. Our first purchase of a baby crib is a wonderful memory associated with starting our family.</p>
<p>Connie has always been my support, really my helpmate. Without her indefatigable loyalty, the interesting path that has been our life together would not have been possible. Never looking back, she has supported our partnership with a willing heart and complete fidelity. Whether we have had famine or abundance, her desire has been like Ruth of old:</p>
<p>"Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: <strong>for whither thou goest, I will go:</strong> and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy god my God."  Her desire has always been to go where the Lord would have us go.</p>

<p>March 13, 2012<br />Chad Webb<br />Director of Seminaries and Institutes of Religion<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>It is a great privilege to be with you today. I had the opportunity to meet many of you yesterday as well as watch you perform, thank you for your kindness in welcoming me. I thought I would be slightly intimidated because this is a scary setting but now that I see you all smiling I realize the intimidating people might be behind me.<br /><br />I want to teach to you today from my heart and through the scriptures. Throughout the scriptures there is a phrase that is used often that I would like to share, one of the many places it can be found is in 1 Nephi 10:6 in summary it basically says that all mankind will be lost unless we learn to rely on the savior. I'd like to spend a few minutes to have you think about what it means to rely on Jesus Christ, specifically what that looks like in your life and in the lives of others, what it means to rely on his teachings, and what it means to rely on his atonement. <br /><br />I was in a priesthood meeting a few years ago when I heard an interesting example of relying on the teachings of the Savior. A man I had never met or seen since shared a story. He said that he and his family had just moved into town and were quite nervous, they didn't know anyone and their eight year old son had been sad to leave his friends. To their surprise they found out their new neighbors also had a son that was only a year older than theirs, although the other boy was older and notably bigger, they figured the boys could be friends.<br /><br />One day this father came home from work to see his son and the neighbor's boy playing in the backyard, he was happy that his son had made a friend. As he continued to watch them the father noticed that the neighbor's boy was beginning to play a little too rough. Before he could do anything the boy had begun to push and yell at his son in a very violent manner. The father ran outside the back door to stop the boy but he had already run and jumped the fence back into his own yard. The father picked up his tearful son and carried him back into the house to clean him up. While talking about the situation the father began to ask his son what they should do. Now think about how most dads respond when their sons have been treated poorly, think about how angry that would make you. The father was clearly not very happy, and formulating a plan of what they should do, out of anger, when his wife walked in the room. Moms have a more natural nurturing kind response to these sorts of situations, after hearing about the circumstance she asked the boy, "What would Jesus do?" <br /><br />After speaking with his mother the young boy decided that Jesus would probably take their new neighbor some cookies and apologize for their argument. While the father was still thinking of other possible responses, the son turned and asked his father, "Dad, will it work?" The father replied in confusion, "Will what work?" to which the boy answered, "What Jesus taught, will it really work?" I think that's a great question. Sometimes we separate our experiences from the things that we are taught by the Savior. The real question is will teachings of the Savior work in our real lives? My testimony to you today is that they do, the pathway to happiness is to follow the example and teachings of Jesus Christ. <br /><br />I'm grateful for learning that lesson through the example of a wonderful missionary companion. Throughout my mission we served in many poor areas, and sometimes I worried about teaching people the principle of tithing. I thought that even though they would be excited about the gospel, it would still be difficult to tell them about tithing, knowing that they had so little with which to care for their families. After teaching a particularly poor family I remember thinking, and I regret to admit this, that it's too bad we have to teach this family about tithing that's going to be so hard for them. Now I hadn't said aloud what I was thinking to my companion when he turned and said to me "I know we aren't supposed to teach them about tithing for a few more discussions, but can we teach them about tithing next time?" Here I was trying to stall from teaching this family while he didn't want to put it off any longer. He said, "My family lived just like them until we found the gospel, and Heavenly Father blessed us so much, I know if we teach them about tithing then the Lord would bless and help them, can we please teach them the law of tithing so that they can keep that commandment and be blessed?"<br /><br />
  It completely changed my attitude on the things we were teaching, I was so grateful for humble, obedient missionary companions to teach me the great blessings of knowing the Lords commandments so that we may qualify for His help. My testimony is that when we rely on the teachings of Jesus Christ then the Lord will bless us. In 3 Nephi 11 I find it interesting that when the Savior came to the Nephites and introduced Himself he said, "And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning." <br />
<br />Of all the things He could have used to introduce Himself I find it very interesting that His main purpose was to show that He puts the will of the Father first. I think one of the most important things to learn is to put our desires aside and to first do the will of the Father, to follow the example of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and to do Heavenly Father's will is the pathway to happiness. As we rely on the teachings and promises of the Savior then the blessings He has in store for us can be made available.<br /><br />Now, another important lesson we must keep in mind is learning to rely, not only on His teachings, but also on His atonement. Open with me to Moses 4:12 where it describes Adam and Eve transgressing by partaking of the forbidden fruit. In verse 13 it reads, "Their eyes were both open and they knew that they were naked." Who told them they were naked? I think it's interesting that Satan tempts us to believe something is not a big deal, or that everyone is doing it, and then as soon as we transgress his voice changes to a voice of accusation, so much that we believe we are unworthy to speak with the Lord. In case this is a revelation to you, he's such a liar. One of his motives is to manipulate the way we see things. <br /><br />In Revelations 12: 10 it says, "For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night." Can you picture the adversary in the premortal existence standing at the throne of God accusing us before Him day and night? Can you hear him saying, "Why do you love them? They're never going to obey you, they're going to fail, why do you want to help them?" I think that the Accuser is one of the best titles to describe what Satan does. As soon as Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit that's the voice he tried to whisper to them- "You're naked, you can't be in the presence of Heavenly Father, you'd better hide." <br /><br />The first thing Adam and Eve did is find fig leaves to cover their nakedness. Next in Moses 4:13 it reads, "And they heard the voice of the Lord God, as they were walking in the garden, in the cool of the day; and Adam and his wife went to hide themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden." Now think of this, I don't want to make light of the situation but, when they heard the voice of God their idea was to jump behind a tree and hide. Heavenly Father who has the ability to come from where he resides, find our galaxy, our earth, and come to them in this little Garden, and yet Adam has this idea to jump behind a tree? Can you hide from Heavenly Father? And in verse 15 the question Heavenly Father asks, what I find to be very interesting, he says "Where goest thou?" The question is not because Heavenly Father couldn't find him, He knew where he was. Now that Adam has transgressed the Father asks, where will you go? What are you going to do? Adam's choices are to hide, or to come unto the Father to be covered, forgiven, and healed.<br /><br />Maybe we smile a little bit, but that is human nature. When do you feel least like praying and going to church? Isn't it when we make a mistake? Somehow we want to hide ourselves from Heavenly Father. It's incredible the fig leaves we make. We fill our lives with business, trips, tangible, and temporal things, which aren't bad of themselves, but when we do this to hide ourselves from Heavenly Father, instead of coming to Him to have a quiet moment of reconciliation, we miss the incredible opportunity and blessing to rely on the atonement. That appears to be what Adam and Eve tried to do - for a time, they hid from the Father. <br /><br />I once invited a young lady to our mutual to go to Temple Square in Salt Lake; she replied that she couldn't come because she was unable to go inside the Temple at the time. I told her we wouldn't be actually going into the Temple we were just going to walk around Temple Square. And although we might not say it this way, we have probably felt this way, she replied "Oh not right now, I don't want God to notice me." That's how we feel when we make mistakes, it makes us want to go and hide. We seem to forget what Heavenly Father offers. Continuing in verse 27 Heavenly father says "Unto Adam, and also unto his wife, did I, the Lord God, make coats of skins, and clothed them." <br /><br />Adam and Eve had the choice to hide behind a tree, or coming to God to be covered. God so loved the world, and so loved you, that He gave His only begotten Son that you and I could be forgiven, and when we make mistakes and don't want Him to notice us, a better response is to come to the one who loves us most, and be covered through the atonement of His Only Begotten Son. The greatest way to rely on the atonement is to trust God. He loves us and wants us to be clean. Not only to be forgiven but to be changed. In the October 2007 General Conference Elder Bednar used the phrase the atonement can help us overcome the "taint and tyranny of sin." Both the stain that we need to be cleansed from, and also the tyranny, the control that sin has over us. Through the atonement of Jesus Christ He can help us become clean and to have a new heart by changing our very nature.<br /><br />Another way, in which we need to learn to rely on the atonement, is taught beautifully in 1 Samuel 25. The story is of a man named Nebal who is described as being very wealthy, rude, and rough; his wife Abigail on the other hand is very beautiful in countenance and kind. During this time David is at war protecting Israel, while Nebal is at home prospering. David sends a messenger to Nebal asking him to provide his men with a feast since they are protecting his prospering land. As the messenger went to Nebal in verse 10 we find Nebal's reply,"Who is David.. (that I would) take my bread and my water" and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?" At this point David is a little prideful and when he hears the response from Nebal, he decides to gather up his people, and in verse 13 he does just that, it says "And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff." <br /><br />One of the servants of Nebal heard of this and rushed to Abigail, to let her know of the situation. Abigail in the next few verses is such a perfect example of living like the Savior. In verse 18 it says "Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs." She filled up this wagon to go meet David as he was coming with his army. <br /><br />There are four things I'd like you to notice that Abigail says to David, starting in verse 24 she says "Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be." In other words she says, do not blame my husband blame me. The second one is found in verse 27, "This blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men." She has brought everything and more they had asked for. In verse 28 she says, "I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid." Please now forgive me. And lastly in verse 31, "That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord." In other words, don't take offense and let what has happened make you bitter. <br /><br />When life is not fair, or when someone has acted in a way that may have hurt us, the Lord allows us to lean on Him and use His atonement. The atonement helps us with our own mistakes, but it can also help us when others have made mistakes that affect us. When someone has wronged us, the Lord doesn't want us to hold onto to it, we are all here learning together, He wants us to forgive one another. The Lord knows of our losses and disappointments and wants to make them up to us if we will only trust Him. <br /><br />I love this story of Abigail, in fact the Hebrew word for Abigail means, "A fathers joy." I can't think of a thing that would please our Father more than for us to lean on the atonement of Jesus Christ to change our feelings when we have been hurt or offended, and be able to say I can forgive and let go. As much as the Lord wants us to be forgiven He also wants our friends and families to be forgiven. His son has suffered for them and for all of us that we may use that atonement, to forgive ourselves as well as others. If we'll rely on the atonement He will make up for all that has been lost from the choices of other people, or when life is not fair. There are so many ways we can use the atonement to help us through all of our suffering, sorrow, or temptation of any kind. <br /><br />This may be a little personal, but yesterday I was with some friends who have taught me a lot about relying on the atonement. Their family received some difficult news yesterday, news that for most of us would cause us to be very discouraged and self-concerned. Yesterday after getting that news they spent the entire day serving. I watched them smiling, laughing, and enjoying being with you. It's easy to talk about those kinds of things but when they happen in reality, the things that we really care about and believe come forward. I watched yesterday as this family relied completely on the atonement of Christ. That comes from a lifetime of righteousness, a lifetime of faith. I had the privilege of listening to them pray last night, there was no sense of self-pity or anger, the prayer was completely asking for Heavenly Father to align their desires with His will. They had complete trust because of their faith in the atonement. They knew that Jesus has felt their exact pains and sorrows. You can learn so much from people that align themselves with the Lord and continue to serve with such faith. <br /><br />
  I wanted to close today with a statement from Elder Merrill J Bateman, he said "For many years I thought of the Savior's experience in the garden and on the cross as places where a large mass of sin was heaped upon Him. Through the words of Alma, Abinadi, Isaiah, and other prophets, however, my view has changed. Instead of an impersonal mass of sin, there was a long line of people, as Jesus felt "our infirmities" (Heb. 4:15), "[bore] our grief's, "carried our sorrows " [and] was bruised for our iniquities" (Isa. 53:4-5).The Atonement was an intimate, personal experience in which Jesus came to know how to help each of us." He continues by saying. <br />
<br />"The Pearl of Great Price teaches that Moses was shown all the inhabitants of the earth, which were numberless as the sand upon the sea shore (Moses 1:28). If Moses beheld every soul, then it seems reasonable that the Creator of the universe has the power to become intimately acquainted with each of us. He learned about your weaknesses and mine. He experienced your pains and sufferings. He experienced mine. I testify that He knows us. He understands the way in which we deal with temptations. He knows our weaknesses. But more than that, more than just knowing us, He knows how to help us if we come to Him in faith."<br /><br />I add my testimony to Elder Batemans and to the prophets and wonderful people of the scriptures that we have studied today, and the good people among you who have testimonies of Jesus Christ, that have learned to rely on His teachings and atonement. I bare my testimony to you that Jesus Christ is the son of God, the Savior of the world and that if we will learn to trust Him, if we'll learn to rely on His teachings, His example, and atonement, we can come unto the Father and be saved. Of that I bare testimony and express my appreciation of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>March 6, 2012<br />Lloyd Baird<br />Professor of Management<br />Boston University <span style="display: none;">leadership</span></p>
<p>Aloha. Thank you for inviting us back. We have missed being with you and the spirit you carry. It is such a blessing to be in a place where faith and prayer are part of learning and leading.</p>
<p>Let us start with learning. I would like to lay the foundation for our discussion with what I think is one of the eternal plans for learning. I have titled our discussion together, "Stepping into the Darkness." The idea is simple; God is not in the flash light business. In our premortal existence our challenge was to learn how to walk by obedience. We were given choices with clear explanations of the options and consequences. We chose correctly - to come to earth and learn from our experiences and how to "Walk by Faith." Often though, we feel if we just had a powerful flashlight to peer into the darkness, it would be easier. But that is not how this existence works. Even though we might not be totally clear where the path leads or what lies ahead, we are supposed to make choices, get on with it, step into the darkness and learn as we go. But as in all things, the Lord has not left us without help as we go forward. He has provided a process for learning and growing:</p>
<p><strong>Stewardship</strong> - accepting an assignment with accountability, being given a trust for a period of time for which we will return and report.</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong> - the right and responsibility to choose and decide what we will do with the trust.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong> - the reporting back of our successes, failures, and most importantly what we have learned.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Let me give you a simple example. I have a colleague, Horst Abraham, who is a high performance coach. He is a competitive sailor, works with professional sports teams and helps us with executives. Once some executives asked him how they could improve and become better. He answered with a simple example. Horst decides what he wants to work on; for example listening better, giving clearer instructions, understanding the other person, asking better questions, etc. At the beginning of a day he thinks about what he can do to improve. He then puts ten small pebbles in his right pocket. During the day as opportunities come he tries to improve. If he succeeds he moves one pebble from his right pocket to his left. At the end of the day he empties his pocket and sees what progress he has made. He then plans for the next day.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Last year my doctor wanted me to do some exercises strengthening muscles that were weak. I said ok, and put ten pennies in my right pocket and moved them to the left during the day when I was able to do the exercises. At the end of the day I usually did not have ten pennies in my left pocket but by constantly trying, muscles became stronger. I reported back to the doctor and he asked how I was doing. I explained the process I was using and he looked at me in amazement and said, "You ought to patent that system." The Lord already has; figure out what you are trying to accomplish, use your agency to make the best choices possible and learn from your experience by evaluating your progress; stewardship, agency and accountability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lord's Way of Learning</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Christ used parables to help us understand eternal principles. The most widely known "learning" parable focuses on talents. Remember talents can symbolize a vast array - skills, opportunities, relationships, physical commodities, wealth, health, time, etc.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>"For the Kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>
<p>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one: to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey" (Matthew 25:14-15).</p>
<p>Already in the very beginning of the parable, Christ is teaching us a key to progression and learning. He is not trying to treat us equally. He will design unique opportunities for us to learn and grow, but will not give us more than we can handle until we are ready to move on.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It Is Not Ours</span></p>
<p>These scriptures emphasize another key characteristic of stewardship. Stewards are those who are watching over and taking care of something that is not theirs. It is often easy to forget that the Lord is the source of everything we have. We are stewards, accountable for what we currently have. If we use it well, we receive more and move on. Even Joseph Smith needed to be reminded.</p>
<p>"And you have a gift to translate the plates; and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; for I will grant unto you no other gift until it is finished" (D&amp;C 5:4).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We are to Use our Agency and Act</span></p>
<p>The parable continues. Remember what happens after the master left.</p>
<p>"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</p>
<p>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</p>
<p>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money" (Matthew 25:16-18).</p>
<p>We are to act. The Lord does not control our actions; that was Satan's plan. Agency is a critical part of learning and progressing. The Lord sets clear expectations, guides us if and when we ask and allows us to use our agency.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Time of Accounting</span></p>
<p>There will be a time of accounting. We will be required to evaluate and report back on our stewardship, for this is how we learn.</p>
<p>"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them" (Matthew 25:19).</p>
<p>You will remember that the servant, who had five, gained five more. The servant who had two, gained two more. He who had one, lost even that. It was taken away and given to another. You cannot remain on a plateau long; you either progress forwards or go backwards.</p>
<p>Adam gets a hint of the importance of accountability as he is introduced to the role of Christ.</p>
<p>." . . Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time" (Moses 6:57).</p>
<p>Of all the titles that could have been used to introduce and explain the role of Christ, He is introduced as a righteous judge. And then the critical part, a command to us:</p>
<p>"Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children. . . ." (Moses 6:58).</p>
<p>We should learn these principles now. As we stand before Christ for our final accounting it should not be the first time we have reported back. That accounting will be more for us to come to a realization of what we have done, what we have learned and most importantly what we have become, using our agency. He already knows. It would be very good for our self evaluation to agree with His. We should have practiced enough that we know very clearly the principles of return and report. He explains to us many times in the scriptures the importance of accounting.</p>
<p>"And verily in this thing ye have done wisely, for it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity" (D&amp;C 72:3).</p>
<p>This process of stewardship, agency and accountability can be applied in many aspects of life. For example, imagine what your classes would be like if everyone applied these eternal principles of learning. Rather than simply skimming the assigned material before you go to class, why not really take your stewardship seriously. Read the material, study it and develop two to three questions which would help you better understand. Then, go to class and at the appropriate time raise your hand and ask something like, 'I don't understand when the author said ________, how does that apply to ____, but last week we talked about _________and I am not sure how it relates. But if I get a different result in the experiment what does it mean?'</p>
<p>Imagine what the class would be like if everyone came with two or three questions. After the teacher recovered from the shock of having a prepared class, you would probably have a wonderful discussion. Many of you have actually been in classes like that. Was it not great? Now, after the class, go home, sit down, take out a piece of paper or your computer and at the top write, today I learned and then write down what you learned. As you prepare for the next class, review what you have written, prepare again and write down questions and what you want to learn in the next class.</p>
<p>Or how about your home or visiting teaching. When is the last time you took your stewardship seriously, acted and then returned and reported?  Seriously returned and reported and planned for the next visit. And why are you waiting for someone to contact you for your report. Part of accepting the stewardship, is accepting the responsibility of returning and reporting. Imagine what your quorum or Relief Society would be like if everyone did that. Of course now you would have a Bishop in shock, but he would recover and then he could get on with his stewardship, rather than filling in where we fall down on ours. Some of you have actually been in quorums, relief society groups or Wards that work like that. It only takes one to get it started, so go be that one.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lord's Way of Leading</span></p>
<p>So how does the process of stewardship, agency and accountability apply to leadership? At some point in our own eternal progression we have to focus on others. We can go no further by worrying about our own eternal progress. We have to start worrying about the progress of others. You have to be focused on lifting them, serving them, and helping them. That is the Lord's definition of leadership. It applies at Church, it applies at school and it applies in life.  It is also the best definition of leadership the world has, because as leaders it is not about what you accomplish, it is about what you help others accomplish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An example</span></p>
<p>We were working with an executive named Steve. He was employed at a large retail firm but was stuck at his current level because he focused on himself and what he could accomplish. He was not engaging others, motivating them, helping them do their jobs. His approach was what we call in leadership studies, command and control. His superiors asked us to work with Steve to see if he could change his approach to see the bigger picture, understand how he was affecting other people, and improve his ability to lead. He was African American, which fact will become important as I tell his story. We worked with Steve for nine months and were making little progress. As one of the activities, we went to the site of the Battle of Gettysburg. Over the course of the day we walked the battlefield and used the examples from the engagement to highlight leadership. At a very critical point in the Battle of Gettysburg, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, who commanded the 5th Corps, gave a speech to some mutineers who were refusing to fight. Let me quote a bit from his recreated comments. As I do, pay particular attention to how he reframes their stewardship so they could understand, commit and act on their responsibilities. I am not trying to glorify war, or suggest who was good or bad; I am trying to suggest an approach to working with others.</p>
<p>"I have been told that if you don't come I can shoot you. Well you know I won't do that...</p>
<p>This is a different kind of Army. If you look at history you'll see men fight for pay...,They fight for land, or because a king makes them... But we're here for something new... That hasn't happened before much in the history of the world. We're an army going out to set other men free...</p>
<p>It's the idea that we all have value, you and me, we're worth something more than the dirt...What we're fighting for in the end, is each other..."</p>
<p>I think if we lose this fight the war will be over. So if you choose to come with us I'll be personally grateful" (Useem, 1998).</p>
<p>The 5th Corps was given the end of the line to defend at a place called "Little Round Top", the end where the enemy must not sweep or the battle would be lost. The enemy charged many times, and in the process the men of the 5th Corps used all their ammunition. As the enemy was coming yet again, Colonel Chamberlain gave the command to fix bayonet and charge down the hill into what was bound to be withering fire. At this critical point, each of them, including the mutineers fixed bayonets and charged down the hill, so surprising to the superior enemy force that they retreated at a fast run. The battle and, by some historians' accounts, the war was saved.</p>
<p>I stood next to Steve on Little Round Top as our guide asked us to look down the hill and imagine the enemy's charge and what Colonel Chamberlain was asking his troops to do. It was very moving. I looked over at Steve and he was obviously having a very emotional experience. As we were walking away from the site I asked him if he was ok. He said yes he was fine. And then he said "This is the first time I have understood what others have done for me". He was beginning to understand his own leadership responsibilities in a different way. For that moment the unspoken leadership question became what could he do for others.</p>
<p>Leadership is helping others to more clearly understand their stewardship, use their agency to act and be accountable. Notice how in the economy of the eternities, the process we use as leaders is exactly the same as the one the Lord uses with us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joseph Smith</span></p>
<p>Joseph Smith was once asked how he handled such a great load.  He was the religious leader, the military leader, and the governmental leader. He answered simply, "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves". This is not command and control. This is stewardship, agency and accountability. Where did he learn these principles? He learned from his study of the scriptures and tutoring from many heavenly messengers. Moroni was his senior companion and trainer for four years. Every year when they met, and probably more often than that, I am sure there was an accounting and Moroni would give more instructions. The fourth year his mother records Joseph reporting a meeting with Moroni by saying he, Joseph, was instructed, ." ..that the time has now come when the record should be brought forth, and that I must be up and doing..." (Proctor &amp; Proctor, 1996). He was prepared and the Book of Mormon was to come forth.</p>
<p>The Lord also taught Joseph through revelation.</p>
<p>"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</p>
<p>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</p>
<p>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward (D&amp;C 58: 26-28).</p>
<p>We had the privilege of working with Ingar Skaug, recently retired Chief Executive Officer of Wilhelmsen, one of the largest shipping and logistics companies in the world. A number of years ago, a ship loaded with refugees, was sinking. The Captain of a Wilhelmsen ship detoured his route and rescued over 400 people. He loaded them on his ship which was designed to hold a crew of less than 50 plus cargo. They headed for Australia, but as they approached, the government of Australia would not let them unload the refugees. Instead they told the Captain to take the refugees back to where they came from, which would have been suicide. Instead, the Captain said, no, we will stay here and feed and take care of these people until they are allowed to come ashore. After an 8-day stand-off, including a boarding of the ship by the military, arrangements were finally made and the refugees were allowed to go ashore and begin new lives. Of course, the cargo the Wilhelmsen ship was carrying was delayed, customers had to wait and Wilhelmsen lost money. But the captain did not have to be told what to do, he knew and he acted.  Ingar taught correct principles, expected people to act and held them accountable for their actions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Us</span></p>
<p>To help us learn how to lead using these principles, the Lord has woven opportunities to practice into the very fabric of our lives. We are in Church positions where we can help people understand their stewardships, help them use their agency, make proper choices and most importantly, give them the opportunity to report back. As Elder's Quorum and Relief Society Presidencies, as district leaders, as teachers in the Sunday School, in all positions; do not rob those you work and serve with of the opportunity to report back and learn from their experiences.</p>
<p>We worked with General Gordon Sullivan when he was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. He took us on a four day trip visiting bases with the assignment of assessing leadership in the Army. I fear we learned more from him than he did from us. After four days we were exhausted and boarded his plane to return to Washington, D.C. I expected to do what I usually do in airplanes, read or sleep. But no, as soon as we sat down he said ok, time for the AAR. That stands for After Action Review and for the next three hours we talked about what we had seen, what we had learned and what we would recommend going forward. A very important leadership lesson was reinforced that day; always evaluate, report back and learn how to improve for the next time. An AAR can be a fairly simple set of questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions on how to do an AAR, visit Schofield Barracks on the way to Honolulu and ask anyone in the military. They do it all the time, as should we. I hope you recognize embedded in the AAR process, the concepts of stewardship, agency and accountability. You will be amazed how quickly you and others will improve if you just hold yourselves and them accountable. Let me share a little secret about relationships. It even works on dates, or in marriage. Try it, rather than you doing all the talking simply ask, so how did it go? What happened? How can I help next time?</p>
<p>Now a final example. C.O. Woody was an executive at a large power company. The company's executives asked me and some colleagues to interview employees and managers, and design a leadership program to help them improve. Everywhere I went, people's response was "Oh, C.O. helped us do that"."C.O. was the person that directed that, he will be the one to figure it out in the future." My last appointment of the day was with C.O. Woody. As I sat down and I said something like, "C.O. you are a legend around here. How do you work with these people?" C.O. was very self effacing and gave some general answers about working hard and getting other people involved. I finally pushed him a little and he said, "Well look around the office and tell me what you see." The walls were filled with pictures of his family, groups he had worked with, workers at plants he had visited. He explained, "A couple of years ago, I had a heart attack but the good Lord gave me another chance. As I was lying in the hospital recovering I decided when I came back to work I was going to treat everyone like family." We talked a bit and I think I understood what he was saying. But I finally really understood later in the lunch room. Mildred, and that is the best I can remember her name, was doing her job of cleaning tables and straightening up the area. She was looking radiant. I had seen her before so I knew a bit of her history as a single mom just trying to make it through, and I said, "Mildred, must be a good day," She said "great day, I am finally graduating." So I said "congratulations on finishing High School". And she said. "No, college". College? And then she told me how years before she was moping around the cafeteria doing her job, when C.O. asked her what was up. She explained the challenges she was facing and she reported he said something like, "Tell you what, we will support you to start taking classes at the community college. You keep going and keep your grades up and we will help you get a degree that will qualify you for a better paying job." C.O. held people to high expectations, helped them and held them accountable. Mildred was graduating and moving on. Can you think of anything Mildred would not do for C.O. Woody? Of course the answer is, Mildred would devote her full energy and creativity to helping C.O. Woody. He treated everyone that way, and they responded with high energy and high performance. The Lord's way of leading really works.</p>
<p>We have a granddaughter, Megan. When she was three her parents asked her what she wanted for Christmas. She said, "An elevator". They looked at her and thought how crazy, but this will pass. They went about preparing for Christmas, putting up decorations, baking, and buying presents. Christmas morning came and Megan came running into the room all excited, but the excitement soon turned to tears. Her parents tried to console her and asked her what was wrong, she said, "I didn't get an elevator". How many of us are asking for an elevator and are disappointed when we don't get one? I hope someday maybe you get yours; even a class A elevator with mirrors, carpet and music. But I can suggest different requests to put in your prayers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make the questions very specific, with actions you can use to fill your stewardship and help others fill theirs on a daily and weekly basis.  My guess is that if we do that, we will eventually be quite satisfied with what the Lord has in mind, rather than the elevator we really thought we wanted.</p>
<p>This process of stewardship, agency and accountability really works. But we have to use it. Do not skip any steps, especially accountability. You have to evaluate progress, return and report and redefine your stewardship to a new higher standard. It is the only way you can learn and go forward. When you are in a leadership position, do not deprive others of the opportunity to make progress. Help them properly frame their stewardship, make wise choices and hold them accountable for what they have accomplished, what they have learned and what they have become. The Lord loves each and every one of us. He has custom designed the path we are following to give us the best opportunities to progress. Take advantage of the experiences you have to learn and the opportunities you have to lead. God bless you as go forth to accomplish the purposes of this wonderful University; to learn, to lead and to build.</p>

<p><strong>Brilliant Inventions</strong></p>
<p>President Wheelwright and I have 18 adorable grandchildren, with one on the way, and each is a source of great delight to us. Of course they're all unique and talented but there seems to be about one per family that arrives with the "invention" bug, and they've come up with some pretty clever things!</p>
<p>Rachel is nine years old. When her older sister left for college, she begged her parents to turn her vacated room into a science lab to use for experiments and inventions. Though her parents refused, that didn't stop Rachel from inventing the Snazzy Page Turner to help her hold her music in place as she practices the piano.</p>
<p>Steele is eight years old. He recently took a bad fall while sledding, resulting in scrapes and bruises all over. During his convalescence he came up with this solution: He calls it the RareTip. Pretty ingenious! Luckily, he has a willing and capable dad to help with his big ideas.</p>
<p>Ben is four years old. Ben introduces himself to strangers by announcing, "My name is Ben and I'm an inventor!" Ben's favorite tools are twist ties, toilet paper rolls, and Elmer's glue. He recently asked his mother if she would please buy an emergency supply of 129 bottles of glue, so he would never run out. One of his bigger creations of late was an airplane that filled much of the garage, using every piece of scrap wood he could find, and more than a little glue.</p>
<p>As you might have realized by now, there's a fairly wide range of usefulness, not to mention safety, among these inventions. Some, though currently in prototype form, might actually prove helpful, like Rachel's Snazzy Page Turner or Steele's RareTip; others, like Ben's airplane, might be more of a liability than an asset, I'm afraid!</p>
<p>Life is a lot like that, isn't it? There are things we use, inventions, if you will, that make our lives easier, and other things we use that might actually make our lives harder. In fact, you may know certain people who just seem to have a gift for simplifying their lives, while others have a real knack for complicating things.</p>
<p>What's the difference? What is your friend who is always on time, always neatly groomed, and always remembering birthdays doing differently than your neighbor who seems to be perpetually "a day late and a dollar short?" What's the secret?</p>
<p><strong>A Riddle</strong></p>
<p>I have a theory about that secret of success, and that's what I'd like to share with you today. Let's start with a "Who am I" riddle.</p>
<p>I am your constant companion, like it or not.<br />I may be your greatest helper or your heaviest burden.<br />I will push you forward or drag you down<br />but I am completely at your command.<br />I am the servant of great men and the master of failures.<br />Take me, train me, be firm with me,<br />and I will put the world at your feet.<br />Be easy with me, and I will destroy you.<br />Who am I?</p>
<p>Well, some of you sleuths may have deduced that this riddle personifies HABIT. As we all know, our habits can be much like my grandchildren's inventions:helpful or harmful, practical or painful.</p>
<p>So what is a habit, exactly? Well, physiologically speaking, when we perform any action repeatedly, our brains actually create new neurological pathways in order to make executing that routine more efficient. The formation and use of those pathways are what constitute habit. So habits exist to conserve energy, both physical and mental. We can think of them as hardened ruts in a once-muddy country road; it's much easier to drive in the ruts than it is to drive across them; in fact, it's almost effortless.</p>
<p>Habits are much more prevalent in our daily lives than we might realize. Scientists estimate that anywhere from 50 to 90% of our everyday behavior is based on habit! If this is true then it's likely that the only way to effect real change in our lives is to change our habits. Deep down, I think we all know this, whether we want to admit it or not. Habits are huge! Over 2000 years ago, Ovid declared, "Nothing is more powerful than habit."</p>
<p>We can consider our habits to be like our own personal inventions, some of which are more useful than others. In order to live up to our potential, we need to take steps to manage our habits, rather than allowing our habits to manage us.</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong></p>
<p>Through the gospel, we know it's possible for us to gain this sort of control over our bodies; in fact, it's one of the main reasons we are here on Earth. We often discuss the importance of agency, and it certainly applies to the study of habit. Elder Delbert L. Stapley recognized,</p>
<p>"We are not born into this world with fixed habits. Neither do we inherit a noble character. Instead, as children of God, we are given the privilege and opportunity of choosing which way of life we will follow:which habits we will form."</p>
<p>So agency is as critical to our success as habit; in fact, agency is the one condition required for personal growth.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants section 58, verses 27 and 28 reads,</p>
<p>"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in them, wherefore they are agents unto themselves."</p>
<p>The power of personal agency is one of the core doctrines underlying the Plan of Salvation. In an excellent devotional given in 2009 at BYU-Idaho, Vice President Clark Gilbert summed up agency beautifully:</p>
<p>"It is our agency that made us who we are,and it is the use of our agency that will shape who we become."</p>
<p>Or, like Elder Stapley put it, the habits we choose to form are, in reality, forming our character, be it noble or not.</p>
<p>Living with Intention</p>
<p>Remember I told you that I have a theory about the secret of success. Obviously, it has to do with habits but the real "secret" isn't figuring out what habits will make you successful; I think you already know that. The trick is in knowing how to consistently do those things that you know will make you successful, or in other words, knowing how to form those habits. It's all about intentionally establishing habits and routines that will guarantee your success. The true hallmark of ALL successful people is consistent, purposeful action, and it's within all of our reach. It's what I call "living with intention."</p>
<p>Living with intention requires us to do some self-examination. Like an old Spanish proverb says, "Self-knowledge is the beginning of self-improvement." So we'll need to start living intentionally by considering our current habits, both bad and good. This isn't as easy as it sounds! Mark Twain quipped, "Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits." Like the mote and the beam we read about in the Bible, it's often easier to see our brother's flaws more clearly than our own. But, whether we want to figure it out on our own or ask for someone else's opinion, we need to identify those habits we wish to change, replace, improve, or develop.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Habits</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of getting it over with, let's first consider bad habits. The Book of Mormon offers us some encouraging words on this discouraging topic:</p>
<p>"And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."</p>
<p>So with humility and faith we can overcome those habits that are holding us back and keeping us from reaching our potential, from developing a "noble character." Some of these bad habits might be very obvious, like struggling with a certain element of the Word of Wisdom or the Honor Code. Some are less obvious but equally dangerous, like allowing the seductive snares of popular media and entertainment to weaken our agency. Still other poor habits are a question of degree, like joining the growing crowd of "social media slaves" who feel compelled to tweet, text, and Facebook constantly, opening the door of your mind to endless distractions and robbing you of your precious ability to focus.</p>
<p>As you are well aware, and as these examples illustrate, some habits are clearly black and white, obviously needing change, but others come in various shades of gray, and those might be a little harder to recognize. Furthermore, admitting where we require change is complicated by the fact that many of these "gray-area habits" seem to form subconsciously, filling a void in our time or activity without our even realizing it, or they may form out of complacency or apathy, because we "choose not to choose."</p>
<p><strong>Self-Imposed Limitations</strong></p>
<p>It may help us to consider these "gray-area habits" more as self-imposed limitations, rather than outright acts of evil.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to the zoo or the circus and seen a huge elephant tethered to a tiny stake? Why doesn't the enormous beast just muscle his way free? From the time that elephant was a relatively small baby, his trainer tied him up like that. Early on, the stake actually was stronger than the elephant but by the time the elephant's strength surpassed the stake's, he had stopped trying, figuring that his limiting situation was "just the way it is."</p>
<p>Might we have similar poor habits in our lives that we are so accustomed to that we figure "that's just the way it is?" Let's take to heart Lehi's counsel to his rebellious sons to "shake off the chains with which [they were] bound."</p>
<p>Elder Marvin J. Ashton spoke of these chains and their self-imposed limitations:</p>
<p>"Who among us hasn't felt the chains of bad habits? . . . So many of us tend to say, 'This is the way I am. I can't change.' . . . Lehi warned his sons to 'shake off the chains' because he knew that chains restrict our mobility, growth, and happiness. . . . Many of us today are shackled by the restrictive chains of poor habits. We are bound by inferior self-images created by misconduct and indifference."</p>
<p><strong>Practiced Discipline</strong></p>
<p>Whether we're talking about breaking old habits or forming new ones, living with intention requires great effort. Unfortunately, "positive habits are as difficult to make as negative habits are difficult to break."</p>
<p>It doesn't seem fair that bad habits often form subconsciously, with hardly any effort on our part, but good habits require so much work! Forming good habits takes intentional desire, repetition, and patience. We might call this self-mastery; social scientists have termed this practiced discipline, and they would define it as the ability to purposefully create habits. I really like that phrase, "practiced discipline," because it plainly reminds us what is required to actually master our selves: Discipline and practice, and it's a non-stop job!</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt is generally considered a master of practiced discipline and living with intention. As a child, he suffered frequent ailments, including severe asthma, poor eyesight, and extreme frailty. His parents wondered if he would survive childhood. But Teddy forged himself into an incredibly strong man, physically and mentally. Before his presidency, he was a Rough Rider in the Spanish-American War; later, while campaigning, he was shot in the chest but gave a 90-minute speech before going to the hospital! He went on to author more than thirty books, establish the National Park system and the National Forest Service, and eventually adventured in Africa, hunting big game to be displayed at the Smithsonian and Natural History museums.</p>
<p>Of his practiced discipline, Teddy once explained, "I had to train myself painfully and laboriously not merely as regards my body but as regards my soul and spirit." Historian Elting Morison agreed, writing, "The energies and talents he possessed were not placed at birth in some natural harmony; they were through the passing years organized and directed by a sustained and splendid act of will."</p>
<p>Wouldn't we all love to find that sustained and splendid act of will? What a wonderful way Mr. Morison phrased what's required to conquer our bad habits and replace them with good ones:"a sustained and splendid act of will."</p>
<p>I think King Benjamin must have had some inspired understanding, as well, of that "sustained and splendid act of will." In Mosiah 3:19 we read:</p>
<p>"For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a little child doth submit to his father."</p>
<p>So self-mastery, or mastering our habits, is really all about conquering the Natural Man. While scientists know that self-mastery requires practice and discipline, saints know that self-mastery is much more attainable if we also have faith, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and an understanding of the Atonement.</p>
<p><strong>Habits Worth Forming</strong></p>
<p>This rightly leads us to the conclusion that some of the best Good Habits we could form are:</p>
<p>"<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>those that increase our faith,</p>
<p>"<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>those that help us listen to, understand, and act on the promptings of the Spirit,</p>
<p>"<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>and those that internalize our understanding and acceptance of the Atonement.</p>
<p>Each of you in this audience can probably rattle off a list of all those "Primary Answers" that would constitute such habits: Say your prayers morning and night, read your scriptures every day, go to church on Sundays and the temple frequently, pay a full tithe, etc., etc. These basics really are the best Good Habits we can form! They are specific, tangible, and measurable, and that makes them quite attainable. And because of their foundational simplicity, they can have mighty consequences.</p>
<p>Jack Hodge, a researcher in the field of habit formation, says,</p>
<p>"Specific consequences of specific habits result in broader, more general habits with broader, more significant consequences,"</p>
<p>and that's the beauty of these "Primary Answers." Just recently, the Primary General President, Sister Rosemary M. Wixom, summed up the wisdom in starting with these basic habits by saying, in essence,</p>
<p>"Making good choices puts us on a path to making more good choices."</p>
<p>Remember, "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass."</p>
<p>But How?</p>
<p>Still, with all the simplicity of these "Primary Answers," each of us often struggles, at one time or another, with internalizing these basics as solid habits, so I want to elaborate on three generally accepted keys to forming new habits while sharing with you some practical tips for making them become a permanent, powerful part of your life. Those keys are consistency, reward, and motivation.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p>The secret to consistency is to have a plan. That's at the very core of living with intention! The renowned basketball coach, John Wooden, famously said,</p>
<p>"Failing to plan is planning to fail,"</p>
<p>and research shows that's true. People who set goals are more successful than those who don't. So the first part of your plan should include writing down the habit you hope to instill. This serves both as a tangible reminder and as a way to track your progress.</p>
<p>Another important part of your plan might be to tell someone about the new habit you are forming. This creates some accountability as you allow someone else to check up on you.</p>
<p>A third tip for making your plan is to "link" a new habit to an already established one, such as refusing to make or unmake your bed until you've knelt in personal prayer. Now this works for a devoted bedmaker -- some of you might be better off linking your personal prayers to brushing your teeth, something you might do more consistently than making your bed! Similarly, you could link reading your scriptures to eating your breakfast. If you're not a breakfast fan, you might choose to hold off on checking Facebook until you've completed your daily study. You get the idea:linking a new habit to an already established one can help you be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>
<p>Rewarding yourself for progress with your new habit can also be a powerful tool to help you succeed. We've all heard of sporting streaks, like Joe DiMaggio's 56 consecutive baseball games with a hit; good habits can be helped along by rewarding streaks, like allowing yourself your favorite candy bar every ten days straight that you say your prayers. Negative consequences might also be helpful in your personal training, such as skipping your favorite show if you skip church. Good habit forming might necessitate a little discomfort at times. Self-mastery, or practiced discipline, requires us to be both the sculptor and the marble of our personal masterpiece, so sometimes we'll feel the chisel.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Finally, motivation is the ultimate key to adopting new habits, and this will be easy if we allow those very things we are striving for to be our greatest helpers or motivators: That is, our faith, the Spirit, and the Atonement. This kind of motivation creates a divine upward spiral: The more we strengthen our faith through righteous habits like personal prayer, the more faith we have to encourage that very habit. The more we learn to recognize the still, small voice as we study our scriptures, the stronger our desire to study our scriptures regularly, even feasting on the good word of God. And the more we come to understand the power of the Atonement as we attend our church meetings and visit the temple, the more we avail ourselves of those sacred, learning opportunities.</p>
<p>When we understand the "why," the "how" becomes so much easier. As President Uchtdorf explained:</p>
<p>"While understanding the 'what' and the 'how' of the gospel is necessary, the eternal fire and majesty of the gospel springs from the 'why.' When we understand why our Heavenly Father has given us this pattern for living, when we remember why we committed to making it a foundational part of our lives, the gospel ceases to become a burden and, instead, becomes a joy and a delight. It becomes precious and sweet."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, I began with a riddle, so I think I'll end with one, too.</p>
<p>Five birds sat in a tree.</p>
<p>Three decided to fly away.</p>
<p>How many were left?</p>
<p>Well, five because deciding to fly away is not the same thing as actually flying away. If we leave here today merely having decided to change our habits, we will be no better off than when we arrived. Not until we actually take tangible, measurable steps, like flapping our wings, will we begin to make progress. Like Elder Ashton said,</p>
<p>"A declaration will never break chains.</p>
<p>It requires commitment, self-discipline, and work."</p>
<p>If we are to facilitate real, powerful change, we must fully engage and live life with intention, like we mean it, starting today! To see change, we'll have to get moving and make something happen. After all, when you see a man on top of a mountain, you can bet he didn't fall there.</p>
<p>Start by thinking big but starting small. Think about those motivators:our faith, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and our Savior and His atoning sacrifice. If we understand the "why" of those Primary Answers, it is so much easier to maintain an upward slope toward eternity, which is what matters to the Lord. Again from President Uchtdorf,</p>
<p>"The 'what' and 'how' of obedience mark the way and keep us on the right path. The 'why' of obedience sanctifies our actions, transforming the mundane into the majestic. It magnifies our small acts of obedience into holy acts of consecration."</p>
<p>The good habits we form, which are often small acts of obedience, become majestic because of their transformational power.</p>
<p>Living with intention requires conquering the natural man and seeking to become a saint. Living with intention requires that each one of us invent new and improved habits, beginning today, that will help us with our challenges and guarantee our success. Living with intention means actively seeking for that which is best, every single day of our lives, actively seeking for that which will bring us peace and happiness and eternal life, even when it's hard.</p>
<p>I close with these words from Nephi:</p>
<p>"...He that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them..."</p>
<p>I know with all my heart that these things are true, that we can change, that we can form noble characters and reach our greatest potential, and we can begin today. I leave these thoughts with you, along with my prayers for your success, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>February 21, 2012<br />Kevin Miyasaki<br />Vice President of Student Services &amp; Activities <br />BYU-Idaho<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, "Aloha."</p>
<p>It is a humble privilege to be with you today. Taking the clock back 39 years ago to February, 1973, I recall with great love my days at the Church College of Hawaii. I was a fresh and naive missionary struggling to learn the language of my forefathers at the Language Training Mission (LTM). I felt the "Aloha Spirit" strengthen me then, just as I do this day.</p>
<p>I have been extremely blessed for the past 19 years to be part of BYU-Idaho. I consider this employment the celestial kingdom of all my work experiences. As I have witnessed thousands of young men and women pass through our halls the thought often comes to me, "I wonder how many of these students really get it? How many of them catch the vision of their purpose and privilege of being at a Church institution? I wonder the number of students who just go through the motions. How many miss the divinely calculated opportunity placed in life's path to develop their foreordained potential and capacity?</p>
<p>I worry we are as the scriptures pronounced as having eyes to see, and see not. (Ezekiel 12:2)</p>
<p>The Savior in his earthly ministry came across a man blind from birth. Jesus, the Master Healer, prescribed an interesting process. He anointed the blind man's eyes with a spittle of clay and instructed him to wash in the pool of Siloam. This blind man went his way, washed, and came seeing (John 9:7).</p>
<p>The cured man then went through a barrage of questioning and accusations from his neighbors and the Pharisees. To the point they labeled the Savior a sinner, to which the now sighted man responded, "Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not, one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see" (John 9:25).</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing mortal vision is spiritual blindness</strong></p>
<p>We all came to this mortality blind. According to the divine plan of happiness, the great veil prohibits us from clear remembrance of what we were and what we can become. None of us are born with 20/20 spiritual sight and thus we all suffer from some type of spiritual sight impairment. Like the blind man, we all depend on the Master Healer for our eyes to be opened.</p>
<p>During my occupational pathway at BYU-Idaho, much of it has been in the role of determining disciplinary actions. While in the Student Honor office there were dismissals for violating the honor code. As the Registrar it was my signature on the letter for academic suspensions. And as the Dean of Students I counseled with troubled students and at times decided their best option was to leave the university.</p>
<p>So it should not been a surprise when nearly a year ago I received a phone call from my brother who then served as a ward mission leader in Utah. He had been with a full-time missionary visiting less active families that night and said, "I couldn't wait to get home to tell what happened."</p>
<p>As they introduced themselves to the couple they were visiting, the husband asked if he was related to a Miyasaki who worked at Ricks College? Rick responded, "He's my brother." The husband proclaimed he kicked me out of school, and then his wife chimed in, "He kicked me out also."</p>
<p>They went on to explain they both deserved to be dismissed. They shared some chuckles with my brother about the coincidence of meeting up with a relative whose mission it was now to draw them back in the fold. It ended up being a good discussion. As the missionary and my brother returned to the car, the missionary said to my brother, "Your brother kicked me out of school too."</p>
<p>Wow, a triple play. Did you catch the common theme? Who kicked them out? They all noted it was me. However, I do not recall being engaged in their violation nor do I remember failing the courses that resulted in suspension. In order to have our eyes open, we must first realize we are blind.</p>
<p>When working in the Student Honor office in the early years of my employment, I recall a young man who lived in the men's dorms, and was referred after many suspected he was engaged in several honor code violations. He vehemently denied the allegations, and commented how we lacked trust in our students with our "silly rules". In a short time a second report came to my office that he was witnessed violating the Word of Wisdom. This time he openly admitted to his disobedient behavior and began mocking the College and the Church. I recall having a feeling come over me of a love for this young man. I literally saw him as a Son of God and sensed our Father's love for him. In the midst of his mudslinging I interrupted him, and told him of my witness that he was God's son, He loved him, and he was supposed to be here at Ricks College. The young man responded with a vulgar response, stood up, walked out the door, slamming it behind him.</p>
<p>I recall sitting there feeling empathy for this young man and his heart-broken parents. Several years later, I received a letter from this young man's parents. It told of how this young man never returned home, and instead went to a large city basically living a life of sin. In a very sorry state, hungry and alone, he entered a public bus one night. The driver noticed the young man, and at one stop asked if he would be interested in a hot meal as he was ending his shift. He accepted the offer, and the bus driver took him to his home.</p>
<p>The bus driver just happened to be a member of the Church. He would later explain the Spirit came to him and told him to invite this young man to his home. This was the beginning of a long journey of repentance, and an honorable completion of a full-time mission. This repentant soul could proclaim, "Where I was blind, now I see."</p>
<p>This young man though blind was still in the watchful eye of the Father. As testified, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him" (2 Chronicles 16:9). Our Father in Heaven knows and watches over us always. When our heart is ready, He then can work miracles.</p>
<p>Father Lehi foresaw the path of our mortal journey being challenged by a mist of darkness, even an exceeding mists of darkness, so great that some of those who commenced the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost (1 Nephi 8:23).</p>
<p>The great mists of darkness arise in our lives at various times and take many forms. Sometimes they are great temptations and trials, but most often they are very subtle to the point it is hardly noticeable that our grip on the iron rod has loosened.</p>
<p>At BYU-Hawaii, it may be the mists of ingratitude or entitlement that blind you from seeing the small and simple means the Lord uses to mold you. Perhaps you feel it is unreasonable to expect you to work at the Polynesian Cultural Center, or that your PCC job has little value or meaningful purpose. It may be you think you deserve better housing conditions. You may think the instructors expect too much of you, or an instructor did not reward you with the grade you thought you deserved. Or, you may think the University has no business telling you how should dress at the beach.</p>
<p>If the mists of darkness are not enough, our vision can also be distracted by the great and spacious building which represents the pride of the world (1 Nephi 11:36). President Kim B. Clark in addressing BYU-Idaho students suggested the following "warning flags" of pride:</p>
<p>1. Do you find yourself critiquing the talks in sacrament meeting?<br /> 2. Are you critical of others? Do you look down on others? Do you scorn or ridicule them?<br />3. When adversity strikes, do you hear a voice inside that says, "Why me?"<br />4. Do you react to prophetic counsel by ignoring it, being upset by it, or interpreting it to suit your own desires?<br />5. When you do something good, do you hear a voice inside congratulating yourself?<br />6. Do you feel self-gratification and a sense of importance in your knowledge and skill?<br />7. If someone you know receives something good, do you hear a voice inside saying, "What about me?"<br />8. Do you find ways to let others know of your success without appearing to boast?<br />9. If someone corrects a mistake you made, do you feel defensive and resentful?<br />10. When someone does something that creates inconvenience for you, do you feel annoyed?<br />(President Kim B. Clark "Are Ye Stripped of Pride", BYU-Idaho Devotional, January 5, 2010)</p>
<p>If these questions caused a little squirm in your soul, as it they do mine, our spiritual vision needs correction.</p>
<p>Sometimes the mist of darkness is how we see our outward appearance. We may think our hair is horrible, our walk weird, our shape unsightly, or our voice undesirable. There are countless comparisons we can see in others and instantly judge ourselves as inadequate. The beauty of our spirit is blinded by the focus on the tabernacle of our body.</p>
<p>There are the foggy times when we face disease, defects, and death in our personal lives or those we love. Or there are the mists that come from our lack of confidence. Spiritual sight impairment is evident anytime our thoughts, actions, and words are contrary to the will and mind of Christ.</p>
<p>I invite you to pray to have the Lord reveal your spiritual blind spots. If you ask in faith, he will provide insights so your blindness can be revealed. For as He promises, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27).</p>
<p><strong>Realizing spiritual sight is dependent upon faith</strong></p>
<p>Our prayers should be reflective of the blind men who sought Jesus as He traveled from Jericho. In the midst of a great multitude when they heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out repeatedly, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David." Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? They said unto him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened" (Matthew 20:29-33).</p>
<p>Mists of darkness are a vital part of God's plan. Our spiritual blindness causes us to yearn to see that which is unseen to the natural eyes. We learn that things of the spirit can only be seen when relying upon the atonement and healing power of the Savior. The Lord declared, "Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation. For after much tribulation come the blessings" (D&amp;C 58:3-4).</p>
<p>We should understand the purpose of our mortal journey is stated by our Lord, "...we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught, "What we see around us depends on what we seek in life...The qualities of spirituality we have been able to embody in our lives are often evident in the way we react to death or other apparent tragedies or misfortunes...Strength is forged in adversity...Faith is developed in a setting where we cannot see what lies ahead"(Elder Dallin H. Oaks "Spirituality" General Conference, October 1985).</p>
<p>After my wife suddenly passed away at the young age of 53 due to an initial cardiac arrest followed by a severe stroke, I was on my knees often. My prayers were full of questions, doubts, fears, and pain. Although I accepted and knew it was the will of the Father that Darla should leave this mortality for a wise purpose I did not understand, it did not relieve the anguish of my soul or the trials I faced.</p>
<p>One morning in such a state of prayer, I found myself pleading with the Lord for guidance through these foggy times. I didn't know how to parent by myself. I didn't know how to do our family accounting. I didn't even know the passwords to many of our accounts. I found that making daily menus was a chore. The laundry never ceased and nor did the dust in the house take a vacation. I missed my sweetheart's presence. I longed to hear the magic of her voice. I missed our prayers together, the good-bye and hello kisses. I felt overwhelmed and understood why it was not good for man to be alone. Yet I was. And so my plea for the Father was to show me how to do all of this mortal stuff. I prayed hard with tears streaming down my face as I committed to the Lord to do my part, but I needed His help.</p>
<p>As I rose from my knees I felt a voice say to me, "I gave you your father."</p>
<p><strong>One achieves spiritual vision when we see as the Lord sees</strong></p>
<p>My siblings and I were blessed by having goodly parents. My father and mother, both were Nisei, being born in Idaho after my grandparents migrated from Japan to the United States. Although they were acquainted with each other, their romance didn't grow and blossom until after my father joined the army. Through mail correspondence and brief return trips to Idaho, they fell in love and were married while my father was on a furlough. A short time after their marriage an injury during a training exercise caused hemorrhaging within my father's eyes resulting in complete and total blindness.</p>
<p>Can you imagine being a newlywed, full of hope and enthusiasm for the future, and within a few months laying in a hospital bed with the words of the doctor ringing in your ears, "Soldier, you will never see again"?</p>
<p>My father went through the difficult months of learning how to see in a world of darkness. He was discouraged and depressed at times, described in his own words, "living in a crucible of self-pity". It was not fair. It was not deserved. Yet, it happened.</p>
<p>My father learned how to see with darkened eyes. He learned to read with his fingers and ears. Dad went to Utah State University desiring a degree in Dairy Management. This brought the protest of the College Dean who told him a blind person could not succeed in this field. Dad asked to be given a chance, and earned a 4.0 GPA his first semester. He went on to graduate, and started a poultry farm that grew to a 15,000 laying hen operation. My father retired, and went back to school, earning a Masters in Counseling and Guidance from BYU. He worked with juvenile delinquents, and then became the counselor at the local high school.</p>
<p>Beyond my father's academic and professional achievements, there seemed to be nothing that he could not do. He did the electrical work when constructing the coops for the chickens. Dad gardened and carpentered. He was an avid fisherman, and was willing to do and try anything. There are accounts of him golfing, riding a bicycle, driving a car, and many other sight dependent tasks. My father was even asked to umpire a baseball game in which he said the jeers of telling him he was blind as a bat were all true, and no one could really complain about his calls.</p>
<p>Dad had a sense of humor and a way of lifting people that was remarkable. My older brother shares a story of when my mother was not home and my dad needed a ride to the City Hall to attend a City Council meeting. My brother was not old enough to drive, but he was the only one available. As fate would be they were pulled over by the city constable. He looked at Rod, and rhetorically questioned if he was old enough to drive. To which my dad responded, "Well Vene, it was either him or me." The constable walked away without giving a citation.</p>
<p>My dad had a remarkable ability to discern who a person was by their voice, handshake, or sometimes just by their presence. Then he would always quip something like, "You must be on a diet, you're so skinny, I can't even see you!" or "You're so good looking you blind me!"</p>
<p>My father though blind had remarkable vision.  He taught me by his exemplary life, lessons that I now needed in my hour of despair. As I finished my prayer that morning and in answer felt the words, "I gave you your father", the words of a hymn, "fresh courage take" invigorated my soul. I knew that I now needed to follow the example of my father. I needed to learn to see and understand with spiritual eyes. My mortal eyes were blinded by the mists of darkness, of the pain and anguish of the death of my eternal companion. That priceless message was a supernal gift from One who saw my plight and healed my eyes. I learned that morning that I must learn to see as my father did. Not with mortal eyes, but with eyes eternal.</p>
<p><strong>Eternal sight can be obtained by solidifying our will with the Father and learning to pray in the name of Christ</strong></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:18).</p>
<p>There is only one source which we can call upon to have our eyes opened to see the eternities. The psalmist wrote, "The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind..." (Psalms 146:8), and the Lord proclaimed, "For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will:yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man" (D&amp;C 76:10). It is "by the power of the Spirit our eyes [are] opened and our understandings [are] enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God.</p>
<p>We all rely upon the Master Healer and the enabling power of His atoning sacrifice to become like Him and see as He does (D&amp;C 76:12,19).</p>
<p>Knowing we all suffer spiritual sight impairment, and realizing such impairments are evident when we think, act, or speak contrary to the will and mind of Christ, how do we receive corrective lenses so we can see with the eyes of eternity?</p>
<p>How does the Lord heal us and open our eyes?</p>
<p>I would like to have us study the pattern taught in Doctrine and Covenants Section 46 as we seek to correct our spiritual sight impairments.</p>
<p>In verse 28 it states, "...he that asketh in Spirit shall receive in Spirit." This causes one to ask, "What does it mean to ask in Spirit?" The pattern is taught in verses 30 through 33. First, we learn that he that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God. The Spirit can and will prompt and teach us what we should pray for.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul teaches, "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered" (Romans 8:26).</p>
<p>This intercession reminds us of the great intercessory prayer offered by the Savior when He prayed, "that they may be one, even as we are one" (John 17:22). Being one, means we have to see as God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ sees; we must feel as They do; desire as They do; and act as They do. Even in the toughest of times when the world is foggy and the mists are heavy, we must seek this oneness.</p>
<p>What does one pray for when your eternal sweetheart is at the gate of Heaven? I must confess my initial prayers as my Darla went into cardiac arrest were for her to live. But, as my son offered a priesthood blessing and was unable to pronounce life, I knew the will of God. So my prayers turned to understanding the will of the Father and what he would have me learn and do. On the very last night before Darla left this mortality, I sensed her proximity to her mortal exit, and asked my children to have the night alone with my wife. Although she was unconscious, I read her a collection of scriptures. I told her what lessons I learned and bore witness of her next journey. I expressed my eternal love. I held her non-responsive hand and offered a prayer to our Eternal Father. As I was praying I had an interesting feeling come over me. It was as if the Spirit was prompting me to ask whatever I desired, and it would be granted. As I pondered this feeling briefly, I responded by saying, Father, if it be thy will, please take my sweetheart to her eternal state. I then laid my hands on her head and offered the last mortal priesthood blessing she would have.</p>
<p>Often for us to understand the will of the Father, it requires us to go beyond our mortal desires and short-sightedness. We must as Paul taught see the things that are not seen. I know the love Darla and I share is not limited to the boundaries of mortality, but expands to the eternities. I have been blessed by countless tender mercies to know she is my eternal companion, and though we are separated by a veil, we walk together in spirit. I know she is performing a heavenly work that required her to go beyond my understanding, but my faith relieves all doubts. The scales of my mortal eyes have fallen. I have obtained a peace. It is the unusual peace described by the Savior, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid (John 14:27). With eyes now opened by the Lord, my troubled heart was healed, and I was not afraid of the future. I could also declare, "Whereas I was blind, now I see."</p>
<p>Second, we learn, all things must be done in the name of Christ. Doing things in the name Christ is not just merely closing our prayers in his sacred name, but entails much more. The Bible Dictionary teaches, "We pray in Christ's name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christ, and his words abide in us. We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christ's name at all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out of the selfishness of man's heart" (The Holy Bible, Bible Dictionary, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, p. 753).</p>
<p>Third, we must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with. Again, the key is we give our thanks in the Spirit. When we contemplate, acknowledge, and express gratitude for the many blessings we have been given by the Father, then our eyes of understanding can be opened.</p>
<p>These eyes of understanding are critical in our navigation of a complex world of darkness and deception. Elder David A. Bednar taught, "In these latter days you and I can press forward safely and successfully through the mist of darkness and have a clear sense of spiritual direction. Discernment is so much more than recognizing right from wrong. It helps us to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant, the important from the unimportant, and the necessary from that which is merely nice." Elder David A. Bednar, "Quick To Observe" BYU Devotional, May 10, 2005</p>
<p>You have been given the great blessing of being here on this beautiful campus. This is the Lord's campus, and He knows you are here. You are here for a purpose. He knows your blind spots. He desires you to have eternal vision and become like Him. He will heal you. He will help you. He wants to help you.</p>
<p>Here is the promise: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you...Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you..." (Doctrine and Covenants 88:67-68).</p>
<p>May we all call upon our Lord to have mercy on us and open our eyes of understanding so that we can declare, "Whereas I was blind, now I see" in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen</p>

<p>February 14, 2012<br />Max Checketts<br />Vice President for Academics<br />BYU-Hawaii<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Aloha!</p>
<p>On this special day there could be much that we speak about in regards to love; however I believe that the young and innocent tell us the most. If you ask a child what he thinks about some of the things that relate to love and relationships of love, these are the responses that you can get.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE PROPER AGE TO GET MARRIED?</p>
<p>"Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a wife!" (Tom, 5)</p>
<p>WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?</p>
<p>"On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date." (Mike, 10)</p>
<p>WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?</p>
<p>"You should never kiss a girl unless you have enough bucks to buy her a big ring and her own VCR, 'cause she'll want to have videos of the wedding."  (Jim, 10)</p>
<p>"It's never okay to kiss a boy. They always slobber all over you...That's why I stopped doing it." (Jean, 10)</p>
<p>THE GREAT DEBATE: IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?</p>
<p>"It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need somebody to clean up after them!" (Lynette, 9)</p>
<p>ON WHAT FALLING IN LOVE IS LIKE</p>
<p>"Like an avalanche where you have to run for your life." (Roger, 9)</p>
<p>"If falling in love is anything like learning how to spell, I don't want to do it. It takes too long." (Leo, 7)</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIAL OPINIONS ABOUT LOVE</p>
<p>"Love will find you, even if you are trying to hide from it. I have been trying to hide from it since I was five, but the girls keep finding me." (Bobby, 8)</p>
<p>"I'm not rushing into being in love. I'm finding fourth grade hard enough." (Regina, 10)</p>
<p>WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHEN THEY SAY "I LOVE YOU"</p>
<p>"The person is thinking: Yeah, I really do love him. But I hope he showers at least once a day." (Michelle, 9)</p>
<p>HOW TO MAKE LOVE ENDURE</p>
<p>"Spend most of your time loving instead of going to work." (Tom, 7)</p>
<p>"Don't forget your wife's name...That will mess up the love." (Roger,8)</p>
<p>"Be a good kisser. It might make your wife forget that you never take out the trash." (Randy, 10)</p>
<p>A friend once told me that the word love (or its variations) is used over 600 times in the scriptures. The two greatest commandments are to love the Lord with all your heart and to love your neighbor as yourself.</p>
<p>Also, the great scientist Albert Einstein explained his theory of relativity like this, "Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity."</p>
<p>The author Victor Hugo said, "The supreme happiness of life is the conviction of being loved for yourself, or, more correctly speaking, loved in spite of yourself." (Victor Hugo, Les Miserables, [1938] 162)</p>
<p>LDS.org shares some simple insights into obtaining happiness that Victor Hugo would have benefited from. It says;</p>
<p>We often fall into the trap of thinking a new car, job promotion, beauty makeover, or fame will make us happy. And often they do:for a time. But it never lasts because wealth, power, beauty, and fame simply don't bring lasting happiness, as much as we wish they would.</p>
<p>True happiness comes from following Christ's example and developing Christ-like attributes such as obedience, goodness, honesty, gratitude, humility, love, charity, and forgiveness. It comes from serving others and helping them to follow Jesus Christ. It comes from controlling the appetites of our human bodies and following the promptings of the Spirit. It comes from working hard and having a healthy lifestyle, friends, family, and personal achievements.</p>
<p>Christ-like Attributes<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>Actions Happy People Do</p>
<p>1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Obedience/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Serving others and following Christ</p>
<p>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Goodness/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Controlling human appetites</p>
<p>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Honesty/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Following the spirit</p>
<p>4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Gratitude/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Working hard</p>
<p>5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Humility/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Healthy lifestyle</p>
<p>6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Love/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Friends</p>
<p>7.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Charity/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Family</p>
<p>8.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Forgiveness/<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Personal achievements</p>
<p>This seems like a reasonable list. I want everything from both columns. What must I do? As I was pondering on happiness and these attributes, I received a picture from my daughter of a medical procedure my grandson Dax was having done. The Doctors and nurses needed to check his heart and lungs with the marvelous equipment that can penetrate our shell and muscles to look at those vital organs. Just so you know, Dax gets his name from "D" in Donna and "a x" from Max, my name. Such a submissive good little boy. His heart was fine. As I was pondering on these Christ-like Attributes and Actions for Happiness I created a mental picture connecting my heart to some of those characteristics. I started to wonder about my heart. Not my physical heart, but my heart as referred to numerous times in the scriptures.</p>
<p>Repeatedly one reads "the Lord is seeking a willing heart." He knows us so well; he knows what helps to make us happy. He knows that if the condition of our heart is correct then he can help us, but if we do not let him in, if we harden our hearts and think we can do it on our own, it saddens him because then he sees that we must stumble in the way.</p>
<p>Heart Demonstration:</p>
<p>What does a hard heart look like?</p>
<p>Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which He hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities. (Hel 13:22)</p>
<p>What does a soft heart look like?</p>
<p>And after their temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted, and I will heal them.(D&amp;C 112:13)</p>
<p>The Lord promises blessings of conversion and healing to those whose hearts are right;</p>
<p>How does a hard heart respond to adversity?</p>
<p>And what about the soft heart?</p>
<p>We must make sure we know what the condition of a smart heart looks like. If a hard heart should be avoided then is a soft heart desired, or maybe a tender heart or perhaps even a broken heart.</p>
<p>What attributes will best serve to help create a receptive heart? What will help me be Heart Smart?</p>
<p>H Humility</p>
<p>E Emotion of Gratitude</p>
<p>A Affection / Charity / Serve Others</p>
<p>R Respect</p>
<p>T Tolerance / Forgiveness</p>
<p>Let me use some scriptures and stories to help explain these elements of not hardening our hearts or being Heart Smart. First...</p>
<p>To have a Humble Heart: a broken heart is to be contrite, repentant, and meek:that is, to be receptive to the will of God, or the condition of being meek and teachable. Humility includes recognizing our dependence upon God and desiring to submit to his will. To be teachable.</p>
<p>The children of Israel learned the price of not having a humble heart;</p>
<p>Thou refuse to humble thyself before me, (Ex. 10:3)</p>
<p>If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, (Lev. 26:41)</p>
<p>Forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee...</p>
<p>"Now this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God;</p>
<p>But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fullness of his glory."(D&amp;C 84:23-24)</p>
<p>Are we like the children of Israel even the children of Moses?</p>
<p>Another story that has had a profound impact on my life is the story of Jens and Elsie Nielson. I can share only apart.</p>
<p>I told this story when my oldest son was leaving on his mission over 10 years ago. Somehow thinking we were sacrificing so much, only to discover that what was given in return was far greater</p>
<p>The story is of early saints who sailed to America from Denmark and crossed the plains with the Willie Handcart Company...</p>
<p>Jens, Elsie, their 12 year old son, and a young Mortensen girl, for whom they assumed responsibility to bring to Utah, were left with a handcart, poorly constructed of green lumber, and unfit for the journey. Jens was placed in a camp with four other men with their families who spoke a strange language, English, which Jens could not understand. Jens was made captain of his camp in the Willie handcart company. The company was late starting, and delayed by repeated breakdowns of the poorly constructed handcarts. When finally reaching Wyoming's wind-swept plains, they were caught in a very early and severe winter, with two feet of snow, temperatures to eleven degrees below zero and howling blizzard winds. After consuming their last pound of flour days before, it was here that Jens and Elsie gained a victory over almost certain death through their great physical strength, indomitable courage and unconquerable spirits. Their strength had carried them beyond the endurance of the other four men in their camp who had succumbed to the snow, cold, starvation and exhaustion, and had been buried in shallow graves under the snow. Also buried were Jens' and Elsie's twelve-year old son, Jens, and the Mortensen girl.</p>
<p>The end appeared to be near and certain for Jens. His feet became so frozen he could not walk another step, which caused his right foot to be at a right angle the rest of his life. At this point Jens said to Elsie, "Leave me by the trail in the snow to die, and you go ahead and try to keep up with the company and save your life."</p>
<p>If you believe men have a monopoly on strength and courage, then pay heed to Elsie's immortal words when she said, "Get in the cart and ride, I can't leave you, I can pull the cart." Jens had to suffer the humiliation of riding while Elsie pulled like an ox.</p>
<p>It is not known how far Elsie pulled the cart that day, but in other sources it says the total distance traveled between camps was sixteen miles with some steep slopes! She made it to the next campsite, which turned out to be where the help from Salt Lake reached the Willie Company. For the record, Jens was about 6' 2" and 230 pounds, though likely a little lighter at the time. Elsie was 4' 11' and under a hundred pounds!!! This is a good example of the need to marry a woman so good she can drag your sorry butt to the Celestial Kingdom!! (By Jay P. Nielson)</p>
<p>The rest of the story is this. Two weeks after my son left on his mission, and as part of training for teaching my church history course, I was invited to cross the Nebraska, Wyoming and Utah expanse following the Mormon trail. Following in the footsteps of my ancestors and even the footsteps of Jens and Elsie Nielsen.</p>
<p>At rocky ridge our leaders asked me to get in a handcart and have Donna pull me up that rough trail. As I thought of the story that I knew we were reenacting I was moved to tears. Even though Donna had other sisters to help her I was overcome by feelings of Love. My heart was tender and overflowing, even through my eyes.</p>
<p>When we reached the top of the hill, Donna and I were asked to share our feelings. We could hardly speak. The spirit was so strong. Our hearts were tender. For at least that short time our hearts were soft and smart. Perhaps you can get a sense of our love story.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon the Prophet Alma taught;</p>
<p>"Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe" (Alma 32:16).</p>
<p>"And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved" (Alma 5:13).</p>
<p>The next Heart Smart characteristic is to develop an attitude or Emotion of Gratitude</p>
<p>"Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day" (Alma 37:37).</p>
<p>"Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God; pray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by night. Let your hearts rejoice" (2 Ne 9:52).</p>
<p>You have to focus on what's good in your life, not what's bad.</p>
<p>"I once was distraught because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet." - (Unknown)</p>
<p>Life works in mysterious ways. Time and time again there have been stories of people who are in a dire strait yet they are found helping others who are experiencing greater turmoil. This is because once you have helped someone in greater need than yourself, you always feel better. You feel better because you have helped another human being, and this forces you to change your mindset from focusing on your problems to focusing on their solutions.</p>
<p>Always focus on the solution, not the problem and live with an attitude of gratitude! Mother Teresa was a primary example of this phenomenon. Her entire life revolved around helping others in need. As a result she experienced a great deal of love and self-satisfaction in her life.</p>
<p>I Love the Advice given to Andrew Jackson by his Mother</p>
<p>In 1781 Andrew Jackson, then 14 years of age, enlisted in the American army, was captured and thrown into prison where he had smallpox. His mother Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, through exchange arranged for his release and nursed him back to health. Responding to an urgent appeal, she left him to go to Charleston to nurse some sick neighbors who were confined there on a British hospital ship. This errand of mercy cost her life. She caught yellow fever and died.</p>
<p>Almost her last words to her young son were:</p>
<p>"Andrew, if I should not see you again, I wish you to remember and treasure up some things I have already said to you; in this world you will have to make your own way. To do that you must have friends. You can make friends by being honest and you can keep them by being steadfast. You must keep in mind that friends worth having will in the long run expect as much from you as they give to you. To forget an obligation or to be ungrateful for a kindness is a base crime - not merely a fault or a sin but an actual crime. Men guilty of it sooner or later must suffer the penalty... None will respect you more than you respect yourself... Never wound the feelings of others. Never brook wanton outrage upon your own feelings. (By Unknown)</p>
<p>The next trait: Affection / Charity.</p>
<p>Alma taught;</p>
<p>"Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever" (Alma 37:36).</p>
<p>If I were share scriptures on charity and service, the list is too long. Rather let me share another story from the scriptures that shows the power of affection and service.</p>
<p>This is the story of Jacob and Rachel.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the first reference in the scriptures to love between a man and a woman is the love that Isaac had for Rebekah. The second reference tells of the love Jacob had for Rachel. We talk about how much we would sacrifice for the girl we love, but Jacob sets the standard. You remember that Jacob's mother did not want him to marry any of the local girls, so she sent him on a journey to find a wife from her extended family. Jacob arrived at the home of his uncle Laban and immediately fell in love with the beautiful Rachel. In the spirit of "Johnny Lingo and the Eight-Cow Wife," Jacob volunteered to work for Laban for seven years to get Rachel for his wife. Can any of you claim more affection than Jacob? How many of you would sacrifice seven years just to get the girl you love? It was no problem for Jacob. In fact the scriptures say, "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her" (Genesis 29:20).</p>
<p>Remember Einstein's definition of relativity.</p>
<p>But as you know, that is not the end of the story. Laban was not totally honest. When Jacob went in to his wife, it was not until the next morning that he found he had married not Rachel but the tender-eyed sister Leah. Of course, Jacob protested; and his now father-in-law said, "Oh right. I made a mistake, but you can have Rachel if you will work for me for another seven years." So Jacob worked for 14 years to get Rachel, the girl of his dreams. You might say the moral of this story is to never trust a father-in-law, but that would be a mistake because most fathers-in-law are pretty good guys.</p>
<p>We all know that love between a man and woman can grow until it becomes a force of tremendous power. I came across a story that illustrates this point. Variations of the tale are found in the folklore of Eastern Europe, but it was said to have happened during the Middle Ages in Germany.</p>
<p>The year was 1141 and Wolf, the Duke of Bavaria, was besieged inside his castle of Weinsberg by the army of Frederick and his brother the Emperor Konrad.</p>
<p>The siege had lasted long, and Wolf realized he had no choice but to surrender. Messengers rode back and forth, terms were proposed, conditions allowed, and arrangements completed. Wolf and his army prepared to give themselves over to their bitter enemy. But the wives of Weinsberg were not prepared to lose everything. They sent a message to Konrad, asking the governor to promise safe passage for all women in the garrison that they might come out with as many of their valuables as they could carry on their backs.</p>
<p>The request was graciously granted, and soon the castle gates opened. Out came the women- but not as supposed. They carried neither gold nor jewels on their backs, but each one of them was bending under the weight of her husband, whom she hoped to save from the vengeance of the conquering army.</p>
<p>Konrad was so moved by this extraordinary act that he made peace with the duke of Bavaria on much more favorable terms than expected. These women gave new meaning to the idea of supporting their husbands.</p>
<p>A more modern telling of an old story tells of the affection between a high minded young lady and her devoted suitor. Perhaps you have seen the movie, Princess Bride.</p>
<p>The story in part tells of a beautiful young woman named Buttercup who lives on a farm in the fictional country of Florin. Whenever she gives her farmhand Westley an order, he answers "as you wish," and happily complies. Eventually she realizes he loves her and admits her love for him. Westley leaves to seek his fortune so they can marry, but his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who has a reputation for never leaving anyone alive.</p>
<p>Five years later, believing Westley dead, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws. The outlaws are pursued by Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers, and also by a masked man in black.</p>
<p>The man in black catches up to the outlaws, where he defeats the outlaws. When he tells Buttercup he is Roberts, she becomes enraged at him for killing Westley and shoves him into a gorge after telling him that he should die too, but she realizes he is Westley himself when he replies "As you wish!" She dives into the gorge after him. You will need to watch the rest of the movie later.</p>
<p>I focused on affection in large part because I believe we all can improve in the little things. The common courtesies, the caring concern. So when someone you Love or hope loves you asks a favor, simply respond "As you wish!" and do it.</p>
<p>the next trait is Respect.</p>
<p>As you can see in this scripture you can't isolate these traits completely. Most of them work together to create a heart that is receptive and smart.</p>
<p>"And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need"(Alma 1:30).</p>
<p>How we treat others demonstrates our respect. We must remember that how we treat others sets an example for how we will treat even those who are closest to us. The young man or woman who shows disrespect to a parent, but claims loyalty and respect to a boyfriend or fiance or husband, will someday loose the desire for living a double standard and revert to the same behavior as they have shown to their parents.</p>
<p>This story teaches this principle well.</p>
<p>A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old man's hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his steps faltered. The family ate together at the table.</p>
<p>But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.</p>
<p>The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. "We must do something about father," said the son. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor."</p>
<p>So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl!</p>
<p>When the family glanced in Grandfather's direction, sometime he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year old watched it all in silence.</p>
<p>One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, "What are you making?"</p>
<p>Just as sweetly, the boy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year old smiled and went back to work.</p>
<p>The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.</p>
<p>That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.</p>
<p>Finally, be Heart Smart by developing Tolerance and Forgiveness.</p>
<p>Jesus taught;</p>
<p>"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses" (Matt 18:35).</p>
<p>"And if he do this, thou shalt forgive him with all thine heart; and if he do not this, I, the Lord, will avenge thee of thine enemy an hundred-fold;" (D&amp;C 98:45)</p>
<p>This scripture suggests to me that the sin of not forgiving could be much worse than many, many more visible sins that in our current way of interacting would surprise many. The next scripture suggests that we will suffer afflictions and chastisement for the evil of being unforgiving.</p>
<p>"My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened" (D&amp;C 64:8).</p>
<p>This story helps me understand why we must be so careful to forgive, because we are so prone to misjudge. How often are we the offender rather than the one being offended?</p>
<p>A woman was waiting at an airport one night<br />There were several long hours to wait for her flight.<br />She hunted for reading in the airport's gift shop<br />bought a big bag of cookies : found a place she could drop.</p>
<p>She was engrossed in her book, but she happened to see<br />a man sat beside her : as bold as can be<br />and grabbed up a cookie from the bag in between<br />which she tried to ignore : and not make a scene.</p>
<p>She munched at her cookies and glanced at the clock<br />as the masculine cookie-thief diminished her stock!<br />She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by<br />Thinking, "If I wasn't a lady, I'd blacken his eye!"</p>
<p>With each cookie she took, he took one or two.<br />With only one left, she watched what he'd do<br />With a grin on his face, and a nice nervous laugh<br />He took the last cookie and broke it in half!</p>
<p>He offered her half as he munched on the other<br />She snatched from him and murmured "Oh Brother!<br />This guy has some nerve, and he's also quite rude<br />He never showed even polite gratitude."</p>
<p>She had never known when she had been quite so galled<br />She smiled with relief when her flight : it was called.<br />She gathered her stuff and marched to the gate.<br />(With not even a glance at the thieving ingrate.)</p>
<p>She boarded the plane and sank in her seat,<br />Then sought out her book which was almost complete.<br />As she reached in her bag, she gasped with surprise,<br />Her bag of cookies were in front of her eyes!</p>
<p>"If mine are right here," she moaned in despair,<br />then the others were his and he was trying to share!<br />Too late to apologize, she realized with grief<br />That she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief!<br />(By Valerie Cox)</p>
<p>So can we all strap ourselves into our special machine and receive our Heart Smart exam.</p>
<p>Dax passed his exam with flying colors. How do I know? Because Christ said;</p>
<p>"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven"(Mathew 18:4).</p>
<p>I want to be like Dax and each of my innocent little grandchildren. Some of them aren't still innocent. This shows only 8 of the 14, Dax was not born yet.</p>
<p>A test to help you accomplish this goal is very simple. It is found in the New Testament, the Savior invites each of us to practice this plan. We simply call it the Golden rule.</p>
<p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</p>
<p>For example when you see someone and you look into their eyes, do they appear to be happy or are they struggling with a difficult situation, what's the message that your spirit receives from their spirit</p>
<p>If you then use the golden rule to respond to that person it will help elevate the condition of your heart and make you more receptive to the blessings that can come from a soft heart, a tender heart, a receptive heart.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever told you just how much they like you, well my dear brothers and sisters I'm telling you: I like you. I love you a lot. My favorite missionary companion would always say: "Elder Checketts, I love yer guts." It sounds a bit rough, but we were both a couple of farm boys, and I treasure that thought to this day. I wouldn't think of saying that to Donna or you, instead I will say: "I love your soul."</p>
<p>I hope you can submit yourself to your own Heart Smart evaluation. I hope you find the traits I suggested with many other Christ-like characteristics that will create a life rich and full of happiness.</p>
<p>I focused on how to improve the condition of our hearts. I like to find positive ways to improve. The scriptures are clear and complete on what happens if we harden are hearts. Particularly in the Book of Mormon, they outline the challenges one faces if we harden our hearts. Don't harden your heart. Be Heart Smart.</p>
<p>I believe that friends and those we love and care about are the key to helping us to develop a soft caring tender heart. But we must do our part, we must reach out, we must overcome the natural tendency to withhold feelings and as we overcome those tendencies we will be the recipient of many blessings.</p>
<p>I bear you my witness of Christ, our example of the perfect, perfect heart.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>February 7, 2012<br />Greg and Jill Gollaher<br />Laie Temple Presidency<br /><span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>(Jill) A few years ago my husband and I journeyed to Peru to visit the famous archeological site of Machu Pichu. Because my husband never wants to do things in a conventional way (you know, train and bus) we decided to hike to Machu Pichu along the old Lares trail used for centuries by the Inca tribes who inhabited the area. This trail wandered through the tops of the Andes Mountains to Machu Pichu. We identified a good guide who had been over the trail many times. We purchased good hiking shoes and set off on our adventure. We were living in Hawaii at the time which, as you all know, is at sea level. We didn't have a full appreciation that our little four day hike would require that three times we would have to climb mountain passes that reached the altitude of nearly 15,000 feet (about 4,600 meters).</p>
<p>(Greg) This hike was not only physically challenging but the experience provided us with several valuable lessons for life. The beginning of the hike was straight up to the top of a mountain. Switch back trails that never seemed to end. Every time we reached what we thought was the summit there was a new and higher mountain ahead of us. We hiked most of the day before we finally reached the summit of our first 15,000 foot pass. The view was spectacular. We were all exhausted. As you can see from this photo it was late afternoon and we still had another 4 miles to hike down the mountain to reach our first night's base camp. It soon became obvious that we were going to run out of light before we arrived at our camp. Only a couple of members of our party had prepared for this by bringing small flash lights. The rest of us were literally in the dark. To make matters worse, the trail was only about 2-3 feet wide and the drop off to the floor of the canyon below was between 1,000 and 2,000 feet. We could hear the roar of the river far below but our lights were too weak to even see part way down the canyon. As we slowly helped each other off that mountain, we learned the value of having a light and the value of following that light. By following the light and good guides we eventually arrived at our base camp, tired but unhurt.</p>
<p>Following dinner, Jill and I both discussed the day's experiences and what we had learned from them. We have reflected on this many times since the Andes experience and have concluded that we learned three important insights on that journey that we will discuss with you today:</p>
<p>(Jill) Let us consider the first lesson learned. Success in Life comes from Steady Progress. As I sat in my tent that first night, I wrote in my personal journal my thoughts of that day.</p>
<p>"When the climb was steep and the mountain looked endless and I couldn't get enough oxygen, I couldn't think about the whole mountain because it was too daunting. I had to pick out a spot I thought I could make and walk to there:take 10 or 12 deep breaths- then pick out a new spot and walk to that. It was so hard to breathe in the high altitude. It took all my efforts both mind and body to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>I found myself thinking so often this day of my pioneer ancestors walking across the plains to the Utah valley...day after day and week after week until they reached the Rocky Mountains. What must they have thought when they saw those mountains before them? They must have thought, "How are we going to cross those mountains? How will we get the wagons through?" Many people were exhausted, without shoes, and lacking food for this part of their journey. I had gained a new appreciation for their accomplishments and their sufferings."</p>
<p>(Greg) Some tasks in life require our whole mind and body to accomplish. Many of us may be familiar with the expression "You can't eat an elephant all at once. You must do it one bite at a time." And many parents have told their children the story of the tortoise and the hare and admonished their children that "slow and steady wins the race." In church we teach that the best way to overcome a problem is to not focus on doing everything at once. Don't try to overcome all of our weaknesses at once. The Lord teaches that we grow in the gospel "line-upon-line, precept-upon precept, here a little and there a little" (2 Nephi 28:30) until our light and understanding grows "brighter and brighter until the perfect day." (D&amp;C 50:24). Attending college requires a slow and steady determination. Obtaining that college degree takes many years of consistent effort. And have you ever noticed that the hardest part of writing a term paper is getting started? Once you have started your project your mind begins to formulate how to reach your objective. On the other hand, Satan desires us to always push on the accelerator of our life, race our engine at high RPM's but never put our life in gear. We can always do it tomorrow. We just make a lot of noise, use a lot of energy but never seem to go anyplace. Don't sit and worry about all you have to do, just start taking a few steps. Steady progress always results in achievement.</p>
<p>(Jill) Surely this principle of "steady progress leads to success" applies to all facets of our lives.</p>
<p>Our calling has been to serve in the temple. One of the most rewarding parts of this service for me, was to instruct female patrons before they participated in the endowment ordinance. As those of you who have been to the temple know, it is not possible to understand all aspects of the endowment the first time you attend the temple. I instructed sisters in the importance of returning often and learning more about the endowment with the help of the Spirit. The endowment is symbolic in many ways. Only the Holy Ghost can reveal to us the significance of the ordinances and symbolism of the temple. And we learn about the endowment like we learn about the gospel "here a little and there a little." However, we will not receive these blessings without returning often to the temple and by preparing ourselves spiritually for answers to our prayers and questions. Here is a great example of having steady progress to reach success:to understand all that the Lord has in store for us in the temple.</p>
<p>(Greg) Now to consider our second principle: Cling to the Path of Righteousness and Identify and Trust Good Leaders that are filled with Light and truth. Often it is not clear in life how to arrive at our desired destinations because we cannot see the path clearly. Remember Lehi saw a mist of darkness that covered the path to the tree of life which caused many people to lose their way (I Nephi 8:23). It was only those who clung to the rod of iron that eventually came to the tree of life. I like Lehi's choice of words "to cling" which describe the way in which they held the rod.... To cling means it took great effort to maintain hold of the rod.... In our lives I have learned that it is essential to selected good trusted leaders who have been down the trail before to help us arrive at our destinations. The apostle Paul taught that in this life "....we see through a glass darkly" (I Cor 13:12).</p>
<p>(Jill) Sometimes the path we are inspired to take doesn't lead to where it seems logical. Put yourselves in the place of the Children of Israel who upon leaving Egypt headed directly towards the Red Sea with the armies of the Pharaoh nipping at their heels. Any military strategist will tell you that having your back pinned to the Red Sea is the least defensible position in a conflict. What they didn't know, however, is that in following Moses (an inspired leader) God had another plan. He opened the waters of the Red Sea and they passed through on "dry ground" (see D&amp;C 8:3). In their attempt to follow, the armies of the Pharaoh were destroyed.</p>
<p>(Greg) Most of us know the scriptural teachings but May I share with you a modern day example of this principle. We had a missionary arrive in our mission with a very interesting story (I will not use his name because we were unable to contact him and ask his permission). He was a little older than most missionaries, having joined the church when he was in his 4th year of a 5 year law program at a prestigious university in Brazil. Since he was a young boy, he had wanted to be a lawyer like both his parents. When he joined the church, his parents reacted negatively and cut off all help for his education and kicked him out of their home.  He had to leave college and during the next year lived with members of the Church. He was steadfast in his resolve to live the gospel and made it through the next year working odd jobs to survive. Even though he had only one year in the church when he entered the mission field, he had an amazing testimony and understanding of the gospel. In my first interview with this Elder he told his story as we wept together. I said to him, "What a sacrifice you have made to serve the Lord." And the Elder's reply was, "What sacrifice? It's true isn't it?"</p>
<p>(Jill) His story continues in an interesting way: Despite being rejected by his family, my husband asked this Elder to write his family every week but they had never responded to his letters. About a year into this young man's mission, his parents showed up at his missionary apartment. They had found it by the return address on his letters. They had come to Recife to take their son home. When they first met they gave him an expensive watch, told him they were willing to forgive him, pay for his school and give him a home if he would renounce his belief in this religion he had embraced. When this Elder called to ask what he should do, Greg invited both he and his parents to our home. We discussed his mission for nearly half an hour and as you can imagine the atmosphere in our home was tense. I have never felt such a dark spirit as I did during this meeting.</p>
<p>(Greg) At the end of the meeting, I asked him what he had decided. At that point he turned to his parents and told them he was here to stay and serve. They begged him to come home---they were determined and tried everything they could to persuade their son. They finally said, "Would you just come home and have a psychiatric evaluation so that we know you have not been duped into believing all this nonsense?" They were getting desperate at this point! This great young man said, "I love you mom and dad but I have made a commitment to serve the Lord and to obey my mission president. I will not leave unless he says I can leave." We were amazed at this Elder's resolve in the midst of great adversity. In a call to the Area president it was decided that the Elder should go home for two weeks. The parents could take the Elder to the doctor and have their evaluation if they agreed to have the whole family participate in the evaluation. It was agreed. In those two weeks, the Elder and his parents all underwent psychiatric evaluation. The doctor reported that the young man was fine but the parents needed help! The Elder returned and fulfilled his mission. He has continued to serve the Lord and has been a branch president in his branch in Brazil. Incidentally, his parents' hearts were finally softened and they helped him to finish his schooling. These are the blessings of obedience.</p>
<p>(Jill) Following the advice of his leaders and clinging to the path had resulted in a wonderful outcome for this great missionary.</p>
<p>Each of you have been blessed to live in an age when we have living prophets, scriptures and inspired leaders to help us follow the correct path in life. What a blessing it is for each of you to be at an institution where good leaders as President Wheelwright and his staff and professors are teaching you the things of the world set in the context of the principles of the gospel.</p>
<p>(Greg) Now for our final principle: Anything of Value Requires Sacrifice</p>
<p>We finally arrived at Machu Pichu... all of the other tourists that arrived that day had come in air conditioned cars, trains and busses. However, our experience had been anything but an air-conditioned bus with reclining seats. I believe, however, because of our experience, we had gained a unique appreciation for the people who built this "wonder of the world" that no one else could understand. Our sacrifice to walk where these ancient Incas had walked had taught us something of their struggles and sacrifice to build this amazing city in the tops of the mountains.</p>
<p>(Jill) Sacrifice is a great teacher. God never intended that we go through our lives without having to make sacrifices and face challenges. When people have tried to avoid sacrifice and take the easy road, they have lost blessings. Think of the Israelites who were invited by the Lord to come to the mountain to behold the presence of God and to receive their temple ordinances. They became fearful and unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to sanctify themselves.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith received the following insight into what Moses was attempting to do:</p>
<p>"....Moses ....sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God. But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fullness of his Glory. Therefore, he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also" D&amp;C 84:23-25.</p>
<p>(Greg) As a result, the Children of Israel lost not only the blessing of experiencing the presence of God, but their posterity for many centuries, lost the blessing of holding the Melchizedek Priesthood and participating in the ordinances of the temple.</p>
<p>Think of Adam and Eve in the Garden. They were forbidden to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. When Eve finally partook of this fruit she commented that t the fruit of the tree was delicious and very desirable. Once both Adam and Eve partook of the fruit of this tree, it appears that it was no longer forbidden to eat of the fruit. Symbolically each of us continue to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil each time we make choices. When we choose to do good, the result is desirable, when we choose to do evil, we suffer the consequences. Life is designed to enable us to sacrifice our own will to choose God's will for us. My young friends, do not be afraid to make sacrifices in your life to put yourselves in a position to grow spiritually and to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>(Jill) In our lives, we have been asked to make sacrifices and in every incident, the sacrifice turned out to be a great blessing. Nearly 20 years ago, my husband's employer asked him if he would be willing to move to Brazil for 3 years to help direct Ford Motor Company's Operations in that part of the world. This was an invitation to leave our comfort zone and make the sacrifice to move to a new country, learn a new language, and experience a new culture. Our seven children also had to sacrifice. Our oldest daughter was 16 years old, a junior in high school and very involved in music and drama. Our son was a member of the high school football team with great prospects for a bright future in high school sports. Feeling inspired to accept the offer; we took that leap of faith.</p>
<p>(Greg) Many of you have done this same thing:you have left your family and homes to study at BYU Hawaii. In our case, this sacrifice resulted in learning a new language, learning about a new culture and learning to love the Brazilian people. We also made many new friends who we continue to keep in contact with through the years. Our children had even greater opportunities in music, drama, sports and other extra- curricular classes. At the end of our Ford experience we were called to preside over a mission in Recife, Brazil which brought new spiritual growth to our family. As the hymn "Praise to the Man" states, "Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven." We can truly attest to that fact.</p>
<p>(Jill) As we stood at the top of the mountains at the spectacular ruins of Machu Pichu, we were amazed at what the ancient people had accomplished. Even if they had the great machines and inventions of our day, the city in the tops of the mountains would still have been incredible. Their sacrifice had built a great city that we could now enjoy as a museum in the mountains. The views from that mountain were amazing. It was truly worth all the effort and sacrifice to get there.</p>
<p>(Greg) Our dear young friends, you have a life of rich experiences ahead of you. You will have to climb your own mountain passes and experience walking through life when you don't have all the oxygen you need to be comfortable. Don't shy away from the challenges that you will encounter. Your lives may be similar to the experience of Ammon and his brethren as they journeyed in the land of Nephi. Mormon said of their experience:</p>
<p>"This is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeying in the land of Nephi, their sufferings, .... sorrows... afflictions and their incomprehensible joy." Alma 28:8</p>
<p>Sufferings, sorrows, afflictions and incomprehensible joy are all in the same phrase. That is the way life works as each of us cling to the path leading to eternal life and exaltation.</p>
<p>(Jill) As I reflect on my journal entry years ago in the Andes Mountains it does have application to you today. "When the climb was steep and the mountain looked endless and I couldn't get enough oxygen, I couldn't think about the whole mountain because it was too daunting. I had to pick out a spot I thought I could make and walk to there:take 10 or 12 deep breaths- then pick out a new spot and walk to that. It was so hard to breathe in the high altitude. It took all my efforts both mind and body to accomplish the task." I pray that each of us may approach life understanding that:</p>
<p>Success in life comes from steady progress</p>
<p>There is great value in clinging to the path and following good leaders who have the light of the gospel.</p>
<p>Anything of value requires sacrifice</p>
<p>And may I just add....you meet some pretty fascinating people at 15,000 Feet!</p>
<p>(Greg) May I add my testimony that God lives and his gospel is designed to help each of us develop our lives to be like he is.</p>
http://devotional.byuh.edu/media120131<br><title>The Focus Factor  | Devotional</title><br><p style="margin-top: 11px;">Devotional or Speech given at<br />Brigham Young University-Hawaii</p>
<p>January 31, 2012<br />Roy G. Bauer<br />Institute Director &amp; Stake President<br />Hilo, Hawaii<span style="display: none;"></span></p>
<p>Aloha! I want to thank President Wheelwright for the invitation to address you this morning in your devotional. Here at BYU Hawaii you have been blessed with a diversity of cultures. This has enabled you to express appreciation, respect, and understanding of cultures not your own. With this diversity of cultures and as members of the Lord's Church you have the overall shared focus of the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Elder Richard G. Scott stated in the April 1998 General Conference, "Appreciation for ethnic, cultural, or national heritage can be very wholesome and beneficial, but it can also perpetuate patterns of life that should be set aside by a devoted Latter-day Saint" (Elder Richard G. Scott, GC April 1998, Ensign May 1998). The standard of measure, then, whether or not a cultural practice is appropriate is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Elder Scott further said, "Where traditions and customs are in harmony with his [Jesus Christ's] teachings, they should be cherished and followed to preserve your culture and heritage,"(IBID).</p>
<p>You have had, do have, and will yet have many opportunities to share the Gospel with those who are not members of the Church. In order to do so most effectively, you need to always keep a true focus. Many years ago while serving as a branch president in Fiji, I took Mickey, my wife, with me in visiting less active members of the Church in our branch. In searching out one less active sister, we came across a young lady, Ateca. As we were visiting with her, an almost audible voice kept telling me to invite her to receive the missionaries and be taught the missionary lessons along with Inoke, her boyfriend, who was not present at the time. We had just met her so at first I was reluctant to do so. My heart was literally pounding and the voice kept repeating itself urging me to ask her. I then extended the invitation for Ateca and her companion, Inoke, to receive the missionaries. They did and as a branch president I had the marvelous blessing of performing their civil marriage. Then they were baptized and shortly thereafter became the young men and young women presidents in our branch. The next blessing was to witness their sealing in the Laie HI Temple as a together forever family. They, Inoke and Ateca Suguturaga, have remained dear friends over these many years. We gave to our son Aaron the middle name Inoke and their daughter Siki's middle name is Michele after Sister Bauer. There is indeed no greater joy than to see those who embrace the Gospel, enter the waters of baptism, receive the crowning ordinance of sealing in the Temple and then stay committed to the Lord throughout their lives. Inoke now is the Fiji Islands Manager at the Polynesian Cultural Center and Ateca works as the senior accountant for Hawaii Reserve Incorporated both here in Laie.</p>
<p>In regards to focus and goals, I have heard this couplet oftentimes, "As you ramble on through your life, whatever be your goal, learn to keep your eye upon the donut and not upon the hole." That means to me that our focus needs to always be on that which has real substance as opposed to something of no worth or of little worth. Even good things need to be evaluated if they are replacing better things we could be doing. Elder Dallin H. Oaks states it succinctly when he said, "As we consider various choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is good. Other choices are better, and still others are best," Elder Dallin H. Oaks, GC October 2007).</p>
<p>When Mickey and I were in the Missionary Training Center in Provo with other mission presidents and wives; President James E. Faust, then a counselor in The First Presidency, spoke to us. He related how on a visit to Canada he was very impressed with their mission motto which was "Faith is the Power; Obedience is the Price; Love is the Motive; The Spirit is the Key; and, Christ is the Reason." Mickey and I were so impressed with this motto that we adopted it for the Fiji Suva Mission and Mickey wrote a mission song with the words. If you know any missionaries who served in the Fiji Suva Mission from 1999-2002, you can ask them to sing it for you or have Sister Bauer sing it for you afterwards.</p>
<p>An overall foundational scripture for our mission motto and song is found in Helaman 5:12. As Helaman addresses his two sons, Nephi and Lehi, stating, "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, The Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall." How important is it for us to remember that Christ is indeed our sure foundation?-well enough to have the word "remember" repeated twelve times in verses 6, 9, 10, and 12 of Helaman Chapter 5 in relation to their remembering their righteous ancestors and that Christ is the only way to withstand the storms of the adversary that are all around us.</p>
<p>"Faith Is The Power" refers to faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Galatians 3:26 states, "For ye are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Oh, that we could help all to see out there in the world that indeed they are children of God taking those words of the famous primary song, "I Am A Child Of God" into their hearts.</p>
<p>"Obedience Is the Price" means not just being obedient when someone is watching to see if you will be obedient. With our missionaries, not just being obedient when a district leader, zone leader, assistant to the president, or mission president was present; but at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places. We had missionaries serving within the Fiji Suva Mission in seven nations and one territory; speaking ten languages. One of those areas was the island of Rotuma in the Fiji Islands. Rotuma is a Polynesian Island in the Melanesian Nation of Fiji. We were able to send missionaries to Rotuma after a long absence. As a mission president, I tried a couple of times to visit Rotuma without success. One time I was about to go and received a phone call that they did not have sufficient barrels of fuel on Rotuma for the small plane to make the return trip. The missionary companionship on Rotuma needed to be very trustworthy missionaries, to say the least. John 14:15 contains a simple statement by the Savior; "If ye love me, keep my commandments." King Saul was directed by the Lord in conquering the Amalekites to smite and destroy them and all that they had. Saul, however, feared the people more and spared the king of the Amalekites as well as the best of the animals. Saul then told Samuel the Prophet that he did all that the Lord asked. The Prophet Samuel then said to Saul, "What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?" (Samuel 15:4). Then Saul retorted saying he had kept the best animals to sacrifice unto the Lord, (1 Samuel 15:21). Then the great scriptural verse on obedience found in 1 Samuel 15:22, "And Samuel said, hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." The word "Hearken" is a very significant word. It is also the first word in the Doctrine and Covenants. It means to "listen and obey."</p>
<p>"Love Is The Motive." The two great commandments are found in Matthew 22:37-39 when Jesus responds to the lawyer, "Jesus said unto him, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." An application of this is found in Matthew 5: verse 44 and verse 46 where Jesus states, "But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you . . . for if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same?" It is easy to love those who love us, but what about loving those who do not love us. This is the real test for us in our lives to truly love and pray for those who, for whatever reason, do not love us and yes, we may even say, hate us. Challenging, Yes, Impossible, No! Luke 1:37, "For with God nothing shall be impossible." Doctrine answers the question "Why?" Why do we share the Gospel?; Why do we do our home and visiting teaching?; Why do we invite less-actives to come back?; Why do we work in the Temple for our ancestors and others who have passed on? Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 answers the why, "Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God." John 13:34-35 states, "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." The word "disciple" means follower. As true followers of Christ, we need to have unconditional love for one another.</p>
<p>As the headmaster of then Moroni Community School in Kiribati, I was at a business establishment conducting business for the school when the school's business manager came up to me on his motorbike and told me that our four-year old son Jacob had been hit by a motorcycle and was at the hospital. I went immediately to the hospital and found our four year-old son in a crumpled mass with two broken legs, a severe head wound, and with scrapes and bruises all over his body. Jacob and his friends were playing around the school since our home was on campus and his friends had crossed the main road in front of the school where a van bus had stopped for them to pass. Jacob was the last to cross and a motorcycle driver behind the van bus thinking all was clear came around the van the same time Jacob was crossing the road and hit him square on. We did not know if Jacob would survive or not. However, after an Elder from a missionary couple and I gave Jacob a blessing at the hospital, we knew that Jacob would live. He went in for a three hour operation with a doctor that was oftentimes in an inebriated state but all went well in the operation. Jacob was in traction with his broken legs for a month in the hospital. At the hospital following Jacob's accident, I came face to face with the sorrowful motorcycle driver who hit Jacob. There was no anger against this man but only a peace and calm with this man who accidentally hit our son Jacob with his motorcycle. Christ-like love gives us that calm and peace not only in accidental situations, but also in those times when others on purpose do ill things toward us or our loved ones.</p>
<p>"The Spirit Is the Key": We need to keep our lives in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. As members of the Church, we have the opportunity to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. However, the Spirit will only strive with us as we are worthy to receive it. The basics of sincere heartfelt daily personal prayers and daily scripture study will help us in our sensitivity to the promptings of the Spirit. As a mission president, I would counsel the missionaries to always act on those promptings that they received. For example, the Spirit may prompt them to approach and speak to someone about the Gospel that they would not normally speak to on their own. It is so important that we do not ignore those promptings or out of fear, do not act on the promptings that we receive. If we ignore or reject those promptings for whatever reason, we may very well find that those promptings will not come as frequently in our lives or may even cease altogether. In a manifestation to Brigham Young after the Prophet's death, Joseph Smith instructed Brigham Young and said, "Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go . . . they can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God . . ."(Manuscript History of Brigham Young, February 23, 1847). The Spirit can guide us when after all our efforts we still do not know what we should do. In 1 Nephi Chapter 4 Verse 6, Nephi after not knowing what they could do to get the brass plates from Laban stated, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do." You are blessed here at BYU Hawaii to be able to feel the Spirit just as much in your business, mathematics, and science classes as in your religion classes; for this is one of the Lord's universities. Moroni 6:9 makes reference to meetings in the Church being conducted after the manner of the workings of the Spirit. I feel this can and should apply also to your university classes and activities.</p>
<p>Now it is sometimes a common practice for a young man to go up to a young woman and say something like this, "The Spirit has revealed to me that you are to be my wife." Young women, "Beware, Beware, Beware of such tactics." The Lord will never take away your agency in such an eternally important decision. If you are to marry that young man, you will receive a confirmation of the Spirit for you to do so. If you do not, my advice is for you to gracefully exit the relationship. President Boyd K. Packer, currently President of The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has stated, "It is difficult to separate from the confusion of life that quiet voice of inspiration. Unless you attune yourself, you will miss it . . . You can train yourself to hear what you want to hear, to see and feel what you desire, but it takes some conditioning . . . I have come to know that inspiration comes more as a feeling than as a sound. The Lord has a way of pouring pure intelligence into our minds to prompt us, to guide us, to teach us, to warn us. You can know the things you need to know instantly! Learn to receive inspiration . . . some answers will come from reading the scriptures; some from hearing speakers . . . carry a prayer in your heart always. Keep the Word of Wisdom. Read the scriptures. Stay away from places and things that common sense tells you will interfere with inspiration. Develop your spiritual capacities. Learn to tune out the static and the interference. Avoid the substitutes and the counterfeits! Learn to be inspired and directed by the Holy Ghost," (Elder Boyd K. Packer, GC October 1979, pgs. 27-30; Ensign, November 1979, pgs. 19-21). Great counsel from one of the Lord's chosen apostles. Sometimes emotion is mistaken for the promptings of the Spirit. The difference I have found over the years is that the effect of the true promptings of the Spirit and acting upon those true promptings is lasting while the effects of emotion are temporary. Doctrine and Covenants Section 84 Verse 88 states, "And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up." Each and every one of you can and should be receiving personal revelation. A quiet place is an important prerequisite in receiving revelation. We need to be somewhere where the noise and distractions of the world are absent. The Temple is such a place where you can receive that sacred direction in your life. As you are in the shadows of a very special House of the Lord here in Laie, I would invite you to go there often for that spiritual guidance. Doctrine and Covenants Section 11 Verses 12-13 read, "And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good:yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit...which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy . . ."</p>
<p>As a non-member in high school, I remember admiring my member friends, knowing that they had something that was missing in my life. As a non-member, I went to Utah State University for my freshman year. There I had a member roommate who invited me to an institute dance. I was very impressed with the wholesome atmosphere of the dance. You could actually see around the dance floor. They had all the young ladies in an inner circle with all the young men in an outer circle and when the music stopped the person whom you were across from was the one with whom you danced. When the music stopped, I was across from the homecoming queen for Utah State University. I had a great time! But even though that activity was fantastic, my member roommate did something much more significant. He gave me a Book of Mormon, however it wasn't until three and a half years later when I was at the University of California at Davis that I took that Book of Mormon down off the shelf and started to read, study, and ponder about its truthfulness. After reading the first 75 pages, I received a witness of the Spirit that the Book of Mormon was true. I was at the time contemplating what I should do after graduating with my undergraduate degree from UC Davis. I was seriously looking at continuing on into graduate school and becoming a research scientist. I was concerned because the research scientists that I knew at UC Davis were spending, a lot of times, 16 hours a day in their research labs to the neglect of their families. I felt a real void in my life searching for the meaning of life. Then on page 75 of the Book of Mormon I came across these two verses in 2 Nephi Chapter 9, Verses 28 and 29, "O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish." And then verse 29, "But to be learned is good if (italics added) they hearken unto the counsels of God." That is the key-to hearken (listen and obey) unto the counsels of God.</p>
<p>Well, I then proceeded to go back to my hometown in California and on Sunday drove to the local LDS Meetinghouse; walked in, asked to be introduced to the missionaries; and was baptized six weeks later at the age of 22. I had the opportunity to go on a mission to the Fiji Suva Mission at the age of 24 after receiving my Master's Degree. I thought for a long time I was too old to serve a mission but while pursuing a Master's Degree at the University of Arkansas, I had the opportunity to receive my patriarchal blessing which specifically addressed my serving a mission for the Lord. When I received my mission call, I had no idea where the Cook Islands were located, where I was specifically assigned to serve, or the Fiji Islands. I got out the National Geographic Magazines (This was way before Google Search) and excitedly found their locations and read as much as I could about the islands. As my mission came to a conclusion, the Church Educational System man in Fiji approached me about the possibility of coming back to Fiji and teaching in our Church High School that was yet to be built there. I put in my application at his urging and did not think much more about it until approached by CES some three years later having in the meantime been sealed to Sister Bauer in the Oakland California Temple and our having a fifteen month old daughter. We were blessed to go back to Fiji and teach in our Church High School there, The Fiji LDS Technical College; then, some years later, serve as the headmaster of our Church School in Kiribati, Moroni Community School (Now Moroni High School), live in Guam and coordinate seminaries and institutes of religion in Micronesia, live here in Kailua for four years teaching at the Honolulu HI Institute and coordinating seminaries here, and then go over to Hilo and be there for the past 21 and a half years as the Hilo HI Institute Director and coordinating seminaries and institutes of religion for the neighbor islands in the State of Hawaii. During this time we had two of our five children born in Fiji, one while we were in Kiribati, and one in Guam. We have been truly blessed as a family to live in the Pacific Islands among the great people of the islands. Some eighteen plus years ago I had the opportunity to pursue a doctoral degree in higher education administration through the University of Hawaii at Manoa. My dissertation was "Factors Affecting the Academic Success of Pacific Island International Students" with BYU Hawaii Pacific Island International Students as my study group. There were a number of factors that I looked at including English language proficiency, socioeconomic status, college credits completed, area of origin, gender, marital status, and type of secondary education (American, British, or French). The study concluded that none of these factors were significant in determining the academic success of the students. The three significant factors were autonomy, self-confidence, and attitude combined with effort. Another way of stating these three significant factors is to say those students who were able to focus on what they needed to do, had confidence they could do it, and had a positive attitude and put forth the required effort were most successful with none of the other factors making a significant difference. An example would be a student who is able to focus on his or her studies and not be distracted by TV, activities, or the like taking them away from their studies. They are putting their academic studies as a focus over the distractions of the world or even those things that are good and better, as Elder Oaks stated, but not best for their academic success.</p>
<p>Now we come to the last statement in our Fiji Suva Mission Motto, "Christ Is the Reason." As Ephesians Chapter 2, Verse 20 states, Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone and he must be the chief cornerstone in our lives. Our foundation, going back to Helaman 5:12, is our Lord, Savior, and Redeemer Jesus Christ. If he is not, we will be easily distracted with all the multitude of distractions out there in today's world. We will lose our main focus. Ephesians 4:14 states, "That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of man, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive." A solid foundation in Christ will filter out the deceptions of the world and leave us with the purity of the doctrines and principles of the Gospel. Many years ago the Church Research Department conducted research into what helped youth stay active and strong in the Gospel throughout their lives. They found three significant factors. These three factors were daily personal prayer, daily personal scripture study, and giving service to others (Church Research: "Key to Strong Young Men: Strong Homes," Ensign, December 1984, pgs. 66-70). These three will help us immensely in keeping our focus on Christ. At this time we have put on the screen an image. You will notice four vertical black dots in the center of the image. I invite you to focus completely on those four vertical dots for the next minute when I say "Go." Are you ready? "Go." (After one minute). Now focus on the blank screen. What do you see? As you continue to focus on the blank screen, you will notice the image of the Savior coming in and fading out a number of times. As you depart today, you will be given a business size card for your purse or wallet of this reverse image to remind you how important it is to always keep Christ as our focus for indeed, "Christ Is the Reason." We are who we are, and do all that we do for ourselves, our families, and others because "Christ Is the Reason." Our ultimate destination is being together forever with our families in the presence of our Savior Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>I testify to you wonderful young people that "Faith Is The Power, Obedience Is The Price, Love Is The Motive, The Spirit Is The Key, and Christ Is The Reason. Jesus Christ is the head of the Church: His birth, life, Atonement, and Resurrection we should commemorate daily in our hearts and in our lives. The Book of Mormon is another testament of why "Christ Is the Reason." We have on earth today a living prophet in President Thomas S. Monson who receives revelation from our Lord Jesus Christ for the world. We will be blessed as we follow our Prophet and in turn will better be able to bless others through our service. I testify of these truths in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
