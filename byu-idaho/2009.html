<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.<br /><br />In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children.</p>
<p>I am grateful to be with you today on another great day at BYU-Idaho. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today that you might know what Heavenly Father wants you to do to establish His peace in your life.<br /><br />You and I are the children of the covenant, born into mortal life and come to the kingdom of God at a wondrous and critical time. This is the fullness of times when scattered Israel is being gathered, when Zion is being established, when the kingdom of God is rolling forth, and when families on both sides of the veil are being sealed forever in the temples of the Lord. This is the great latter-day work of bringing people to Christ. It is the work of peace.&nbsp;<br /><br />Long ago God promised Abraham that his children would do this marvelous work. Of that covenant, and of us, the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>As Elder Russell M. Nelson taught so eloquently: "Prophets have long known that the Abrahamic covenant was to be fulfilled&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>'in the latter days.' That's our day! We are those covenant people!"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />You are the children of the covenant, the children of promise; and you are heirs to all the blessings and all the commitments and responsibilities of Abraham.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The Savior Himself taught that "Abraham's children, ... do the works of Abraham."<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>The works of Abraham are the Lord's work, the works of peace. Listen to Abraham's own words:</p>
<p>And, finding there was greater happiness and&nbsp;<strong>peace</strong>&nbsp;and rest for me, I sought for the blessings of the fathers ... and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be a father of many nations, a&nbsp;<strong>prince of peace</strong>....<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>A prince of peace (or a princess of peace) is a peacemaker. When you hear the word "peacemaker," it is natural, and very important, to think of a mediator, someone who calms troubled waters and helps people resolve conflicts and disputes. In your lives you will have many opportunities to help people in conflict communicate their feelings, find common ground, and resolve their differences. Those opportunities may come as roommates, as parents, as home and visiting teachers, as bishops or Relief Society presidents. They may come in your neighborhoods, in your communities, at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="female students talking in apartment" border="0" height="214" src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/2009_01_13_Clark/3c.jpg" width="321" />&nbsp;<br /><br />You may have already discovered that helping others resolve conflict depends on the application of gospel principles like love, kindness, forgiveness, and service. If you are faithful and prayerful in this work, the Holy Ghost will guide and strengthen you in applying these principles, and the Lord will work through you to bless the lives of His children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="parent with small children" border="0" height="214" src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/2009_01_13_Clark/3b.jpg" width="321" />&nbsp;<br /><br />Resolving conflict is an important part of the work of peace. But a loving Heavenly Father desires to give us more. He has prepared for His children a deeper peace, the "peace of God, which passeth all understanding."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;This peace is more than the resolution of contention or conflict. It is peace of conscience and peace of mind - a positive, deep, uplifting sense of well-being. It is a sweet, powerful feeling of total harmony with Heavenly Father, with your true spiritual identity, and with your brothers and sisters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Such peace is one of the sweet gifts of the Spirit. It has been sought by the faithful in all ages and times. But it seems especially sweet and especially needed in times like ours - times of turmoil when the world is in commotion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I talk today of peace because Heavenly Father wants you to walk in peace. He wants you to establish peace. He wants you to be peacemakers.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to talk about what I will call the path of the peacemaker and what you need to do to establish peace. My starting point is a framework given to us by President Monson:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The consequences of conflict are so devastating that we yearn for guidance - even a way to ensure our success as we seek the path to&nbsp;<strong>peace</strong>.... May I suggest three ideas to prompt our thinking and guide our footsteps:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Search inward;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Reach outward; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Look heavenward.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The beginning of our study of the path of the peacemaker is our relationship with God the Father and His Son the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's begin with "look heavenward."</p>
<p><strong>The Path of the Peacemaker</strong></p>

						Today I 
						want to share with you my testimony that we are led by a 
						living prophet.&nbsp; I have already shared this with many of 
						you in Family Home Evenings over the last few months, 
						but I want all of you to hear my testimony with the hope 
						that it will strengthen your own. 
</font></p>
<p>
						I know 
						that President Thomas S. Monson is God&#8217;s prophet on the 
						earth today.&nbsp; Four experiences I have had in the past 
						year have strengthened that testimony.&nbsp; Let me share 
						them with you.</p>
<p>
						&nbsp;</p>
<p>
						First:&nbsp;President Monson was ordained and set apart as president 
						of the Church on February 3<sup>rd</sup> last year just 
						one week after President Hinckley passed away.&nbsp; The next 
						day a press conference was televised from Church 
						Headquarters in Salt Lake City.&nbsp; I watched that 
						announcement with President Clark and others in the 
						Executive Office here at BYU&#8211;Idaho.&nbsp; A TV monitor had 
						been set up in the outer office where we could all watch 
						it together.&nbsp; President Monson began with these words:</p>
<p>
						President Hinckley&#8217;s passing has affected all of us.... 
						We shall miss him, yet we know that he has left us with 
						a wonderful legacy of love and goodness.</p>
<p>
						While 
						President Monson spoke I noticed a picture of President 
						Hinckley hanging on the wall right there beside the TV 
						monitor. As I watched President Monson on the TV screen, 
						I could also see President Hinckley.&nbsp; Seeing the two of 
						them together at that moment was significant.&nbsp; The 
						Spirit testified to me that sacred keys had been passed 
						from President Hinckley to President Monson.&nbsp;
						</p>
<p>
						&nbsp;</p>
<p>
						Second:&nbsp; 
						Just two weeks after that announcement, Sister Ann Dibb, 
						daughter of President Monson spoke here at BYU&#8211;Idaho at 
						devotional.&nbsp; Many who came to devotional that day knew 
						they were coming to hear Sister Dibb of the General 
						Young Women&#8217;s Organization, but they didn&#8217;t know she was 
						President Monson&#8217;s daughter.&nbsp; What a wonderful 
						surprise!&nbsp; It was a blessing to hear the Prophet&#8217;s own 
						daughter testify of his divine calling.&nbsp; In her talk, 
						Sister Dibb shared experiences and stories to illustrate 
						the personal characteristics she admires in her dad.&nbsp; 
						I loved getting to know President Monson through the 
						eyes of his daughter.&nbsp; At the conclusion of her 
						talk she declared</p>
<p>I 
						am proud to say, &quot;My father is a prophet.&quot;</p>
<p>
						The Spirit testified to me that what she said was true.</p>
<p>
						&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Third: President Clark and I attended the BYU&#8211;Idaho President&#8217;s Club Dinner in 
Salt Lake City in March last year. During the dinner President Monson met and 
spoke with many of us, and then he addressed the entire group. In his talk that 
night he told several stories. I have always enjoyed hearing President Monson&#8217;s 
stories in which he recounts personal experiences. That night, however, I 
recognized that his stories are parables with specific messages for us. And I 
realized that he has actually, throughout his life, lived parables that provide 
us with knowledge and guidance if we have ears to hear and eyes to see! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Fourth: One afternoon last summer at home here in Rexburg I picked up the 
Saturday, June 7th <i>Church News</i> and sat down in the family room to read 
and relax. &nbsp;I read a report of President Monson making a trip to Curitiba, 
Brazil, to dedicate the new temple there. I read the following report of the 
Cornerstone Ceremony.</p>
<p>
							After General Authorities and the temple presidency 
							and their wives participated, President Monson 
							looked around and saw a group of children who had 
							been invited to stand on the platform erected for 
							the ceremony. Among them was a 6-year old Lincoln 
							Vieira Cordeiro, who appeared to be very cold; he 
							was wearing a winter coat and a hat with flaps that 
							covered his ears. President Monson invited him to 
							place some mortar on the cornerstone.<br />
							&nbsp;<br />
							Lincoln&#8217;s hat was removed so that his face could be 
							seen in photos and video footage recording the 
							historic event. His head had no hair. President 
							Monson guided Lincoln in placing mortar around the 
							cornerstone, and then invited several other people 
							to participate.<br />
							&nbsp;<br />
							Then he announced it was time to conclude that part 
							of the ceremony. However, he paused, looked around 
							the crowd of onlookers and said that there was 
							someone else who needed to be called upon. He walked 
							around the platform. He looked to his left, and said 
							he wondered who that person might be. He turned to 
							his right. Several dozen people stood on the ground 
							between him and a choir that performed at the 
							outdoor ceremony. He kept looking, saying that he 
							knew that there was one particular person who ought 
							to be invited to place mortar around the stone. 
							Finally, his eyes rested upon a woman. He pointed to 
							her, and invited her to come join in the ceremony.<br />
							&nbsp;<br />
							Later President Monson was told that the woman, whom 
							he had never met, was Odilene Cordeiro, Lincoln&#8217;s 
							mother.<br /></p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the people he could have called upon to 
							participate, it was that boy&#8217;s mother,&#8221; said Elder 
							Nelson, &#8220;That said to me that Heavenly Father is 
							communicating to His prophet, and that President 
							Monson is responding. That was not just Thomas S. 
							Monson standing there. That was the prophet 
							responding to a revelation as it flowed from heaven 
							through him to bless that mother who has gone 
							through so much in caring for her son who is so 
							sick. President Monson had no way of knowing who 
							that woman was, or that the little boy he called 
							upon has cancer. But the Lord knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elder Nelson&#8217;s testimony confirmed what the Spirit 
							was whispering to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson is a prophet of God. He is our 
							prophet. I know that He leads us and guides us by 
							revelation and by example. <br />It is my prayer that we will sustain President 
							Thomas S. Monson as the prophet by following his 
							counsel and his example. I know that if we do we 
							will recognize the promptings we receive from Heaven 
							to reach out to those whom the Lord desires to bless 
							through us. I leave you this prayer and my 
							testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </p>

President and Sister Clark, distinguished faculty, faithful students, it is indeed an honor for me to stand before you today and to be invited to speak to you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Today is Inauguration day in Washington DC, our nation&#39;s capitol. We congratulate the new administration and wish them well. May our national president, Barak Obama, be ever vigilant in keeping America righteous and safe, and may America ever be the &quot;land of the free and the home of the brave&quot; (The Star Spangled Banner). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<br />
I would like to relate to you two recent sweet experiences. Last week my ward high priest group was assigned to clean the Conference Center across from Temple Square. We started at 9:30 in the evening. My first assignment was to empty the trash cans on the 2nd and 3rd foyer levels. After I finished I was asked to dust all the tables and bronze statuary. When I came to the hall with the portraits of the latter-day apostles I noticed the portrait of Elder Neal A. Maxwell was not hanging properly. So I reached up and adjusted it. Afterwards I thought, it isn&#39;t often one gets the opportunity to straighten out an apostle! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I was dusting the statues of the latter-day prophets, I looked deeply into their faces and felt such a sweet transcending peace. On the main entry level there is a statue of the Savior and one of Joseph Smith, facing each other from across the hall. I reflected on the grand moment when Joseph left his earthly bonds and took the divine hand of the Savior in the spirit world. What a glorious reunion! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I cannot express the supernal feelings I was having. It was eleven o&#39;clock on a snowy, January night. I was alone in that grand hall, yet not alone, because I felt that all the prophets and the Savior were there. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A few days after Christmas, my wife and I had the blessing of going to Nauvoo and visiting the temple and several historic sites. Although this was not our first time to be in Nauvoo, it was our first opportunity to visit the rebuilt temple and participate in its sacred ordinances. What an incredible experience to be there in mid-winter, looking across the frozen Mississippi on the &quot;Trail of Hope&quot; and feel the Saints&#39; &quot;angst&quot; as they bid farewell to their new temple and to their &quot;City on the Hill!&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Their prophet had been murdered by an angry mob. Not a single state or territory would allow them refuge. They were abandoned by the very country they loved. They were abused and driven from their homes. And yet, I felt their determination and enthusiasm for the future. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
What held them together? How did they meet this incredible challenge? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
During our visit, I read the journal, <em>The Nauvoo Endowment Companies, 1845-1846</em>,&quot; (Signature Books), of the sacred ordinances completed in the Nauvoo Temple in 1845-46 and read the names of those early pioneers. In the temple they made all the sacred covenants. It was the beginning of reestablishing the ancient supernal rites of the Lord&#39;s house. The Lord was guiding their path, and in spite of the turmoil of being rudely evicted, they were a determined, courageous people. Because they gave so much for the blessings that we enjoy, I could not help but think how truly enriched our lives are today. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
The short prophetic life of the prophet Joseph Smith from 1820, when he received his first visitation from Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ, until his martyrdom in 1844, was a span of a mere 24 years. Yet, that young prophet left a heritage which is unparalleled. Except for the Savior Jesus Christ, none other has given the world more blessings-and in only a short twenty-four years! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Can you imagine trying to be the conduit for the Lord&#39;s revelations in the midst of constant harassment, mobbing, being tarred and feathered and jailed for six months? Research has revealed that in the space of those brief twenty-four years, Joseph was involved in over two hundred legal cases as a &quot;plaintiff, defendant or material witness&quot; (<em>Joseph Smith Papers</em>, visit <a href="http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/" target="_self" target="_self">http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/</a>). About every six weeks a formal charge was made against his character. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President John Taylor said it best in the 135th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: &quot;Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it&quot; (D&amp;C 135:3). Alongside the prophet stood his ever-constant brother and companion, Hyrum Smith, as well as the prophet&#39;s wife, Emma, and others who gave their hearts, souls and very lives to defend the name of Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of the world. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<br />
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the advent of the Christ Child coming into the world, and also paid tribute to the birth of the prophet Joseph Smiths who was born on December 23, 1805. Because of the unique relationship of these two great men, I would like to profile a brief list of their unusual similarities. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Josiah Quincy, an accomplished and renowned writer and former mayor of Boston, wrote these words about Joseph Smith in 1844, and asked: &quot;...What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet....forty-three days after I saw him, [he] went cheerfully to a martyr&#39;s death. <br />
<br />
&quot;Born in the lowest ranks of poverty, without book-learning, and with homeliest of all human names, he had made himself at the age of thirty-nine a power upon the earth. Of the multitudinous family of Smith...none had won human hearts and shaped human lives as this Joseph. His influence, whether for good or evil is potent today, and the end is not yet...&quot; (<em>Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet</em>, George Q. Cannon, pp. 346-351)<br />
<br />
Of Joseph Smith we sing: &quot;Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer. Blessed to open the last dispensation, Kings shall extol him, and nations revere&quot; (<em>Hymns</em>, No. 27). <br />
<br />
In the December 2006 issue of Atlantic Magazine, a panel of historians placed both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young on its list of the 100 Most Influential Americans of all time (<em>Deseret News</em>, November 30, 2006).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<br />
My testimony of the Savior is, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor entered into the heart of man a love that exceeds His love for us. No other person has loved more, felt more compassion, shed more sincere tears and blood than the Lord Jesus Christ. His atonement erases fear, calms troubled hearts, empowers forgiveness upon repentance, salves aching wounds and infinitely and eternally assures immortality. Accepting His life, law and following His commandments transports one to eternal life and exaltation in the presence of God the Eternal father, His father and our Father, even the great Father Elohiem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bells chiming fail to ring His actual thundering glory. All creations witness His power. All time and space operate at His command. <br />
<br />
Man&#39;s words cannot fully describe Him. The most sublime music is not sweet enough to instill the true feelings of His presence. Artists&#39; renderings are not able to portray His transcending majesty. Human poetry fails to rhyme with sufficient solace, the power of his supremacy. <br />
<br />
His voice is like the sound of great rushing waters (D&amp;C 110:3), yet it can be a small voice that &quot;can...pierce...to the center&quot; of the soul (3 Nephi 11:3).<br />
<br />
He made the blind to see and the lame to walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;His peace is as a river and His righteousness as the waves of the sea&quot; (Isaiah 48:18). His mercy surpasses all understanding. His judgments are sure and just. He is the first and the last and beside Him there is no other. He feels our every pain, anguish and sorrow. He knows our hurts, our sorrows and our tears. His love is beyond measure and His compassion is without end. <br />
<br />
Mountains shrink before Him. His whisper calms the roaring seas.<br />
<br />
Though human kind be as numerous as the sands of the sea, yet He knows every name, feels every heart. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Even as those early pioneers faced the daunting winter trail and the unpredictable frozen Mississippi River, you know embark upon your life&#39;s journey. I challenge you to live your lives according to the example of the prophet Joseph Smith and our Savior Jesus Christ to... &quot;keep yourself (s) unspotted from the world&quot; (James 1:27). Further, I challenge you to sacrifice yourselves through the selfless service example of the prophet and the Savior to live to have clean hands and pure hearts.<br />
<br />
I challenge you to emulate the Savior&#39;s love, mercy and forgiveness to make the world a better place, and to &quot;seek...first the kingdom of God and his righteousness&quot; (Matthew 6:33).<br />
<br />
In the final analysis, it matters little what else what we do with our lives if we forsake the kingdom of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<br />
By following His light we can hold back the darkness that constantly tries to invade our spirits. May each of us be more Christlike in our words and actions. May we seek diligently to &quot;come unto Christ and be perfected in Him and deny (ourselves) of all ungodliness.&quot; (Moroni 10:32) As a humble servant of the Lord, I testify of His resurrection, divinity, grace and love. He alone trod the winepress. He alone gave us the opportunity, through his atoning sacrifice, to seek exaltation. I love Him and anxiously await the day of His return. <br />
<br />
I testify that He lives, in his holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br />

<p>It is a privilege for me to be with you and address 
						you today. I hope I can do you some good, or better 
						said, that the Holy Spirit will exert his influence in 
						you for good as I speak. You have already done me a 
						great deal of good with the prayers and spirit you have 
						brought to our meeting.<br />
<br />
						The sacramental prayers confirm that one of the central 
						purposes of that ordinance as instituted by the Lord 
						Jesus Christ is that we might &#8220;always remember him.&#8221; 
						Remembering the Savior obviously includes remembering 
						His Atonement which is symbolically represented by the 
						bread and water as emblems of His suffering and death. 
						We must never forget what He did for us, for without His 
						Atonement and Resurrection life would have no meaning, 
						whereas, given the reality of both the Atonement and the 
						Resurrection, our lives have eternal, divine 
						possibilities.<br />
						I would like today to elaborate with you what it means 
						to &#8220;always remember him&#8221; (D&amp;C 20:77, 79). I will mention 
						three aspects of remembering Him: &nbsp;first, seeking to 
						know and follow His will; second, recognizing and 
						accepting our obligation to answer to Christ for every 
						thought, word, and action; and third, living with faith 
						and without fear in the realization that we can always 
						look to the Savior for the help we need.</p>
<p><br />
						First, remembering the Lord certainly means doing His 
						will. The sacramental blessing on the bread commits us 
						to be willing to take upon us the name of the Son, &#8220;and 
						always remember him and keep his commandments which he 
						has given [us]&#8221; (D&amp;C 20:77). It would also be 
						appropriate to read this covenant as &#8220;always remember 
						him to keep his commandments.&#8221; This is how He always 
						remembered the Father. As He said, &#8220;I can of mine own 
						self do nothing: &nbsp;as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is 
						just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of 
						the Father which hath sent me&#8221; (John 5:30).</p>
<p><br />
						Jesus achieved perfect unity with the Father by 
						submitting Himself, both body and spirit, to the will of 
						the Father. Referring to His Father, Jesus said, &#8220;I do 
						always those things that please him&#8221; (John 8:29). 
						Because it was the Father&#8217;s will, Jesus submitted even 
						to death, &#8220;the will of the Son being swallowed up in the 
						will of the Father&#8221; (Mosiah 15:7). His focus on the 
						Father is one of the principal reasons Jesus&#8217; ministry 
						had such clarity and power. There was no distracting 
						double-mindedness in Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same way, you and I can put Christ at the 
						center of our lives and become one with Him as He is one 
						with the Father (see John 17:20-23). We could begin by 
						stripping everything out of our lives and then putting 
						it back together in priority order with the Savior at 
						the center. We would first put in place the things that 
						make it possible always to remember Him&#8212;frequent prayer, 
						studying and pondering the scriptures, thoughtful study 
						of apostolic teachings, weekly preparation to partake of 
						the sacrament worthily, Sunday worship, recording and 
						remembering what the Spirit and experience teach us 
						about discipleship. There may be other things that will 
						come to your mind particularly suited to you at this 
						point in your life. Once adequate time and means for 
						these matters, for centering our lives in Christ, have 
						been put in place, we can begin to add other 
						responsibilities and things of value insofar as time and 
						resources will permit, such as education and family 
						responsibilities. In this way the essential will not be 
						crowded out of our lives by the merely good, and things 
						of lesser value will take a lower priority or fall away 
						altogether.<br />
						I recognize that aligning our will to that of Jesus 
						Christ as He aligned His will to the Father&#8217;s is 
						something not easily achieved. President Brigham Young 
						spoke understandingly of our challenge when he said:</p>
<p>After all that has been said and done, after he 
							has led this people so long, do you not perceive 
							that there is a lack of confidence in our God? Can 
							you perceive it in yourselves? You may ask, 
							&#8216;[Brother] Brigham, do you perceive it in yourself?&#8217; 
							I do, I can see that I yet lack confidence, to some 
							extent, in him whom I trust.&#8212;Why? Because I have not 
							the power, in consequence of that which the fall has 
							brought upon me. . . . <br />
<br />
							Something rises up within me, at times[,] that . . . 
							draws a dividing line between my interest and the 
							interest of my Father in heaven; something that 
							makes my interest and the interest of my Father in 
							heaven not precisely one. . . .<br />
<br />
							We should feel and understand, as far as possible, 
							as far as fallen nature will let us, as far as we 
							can get faith and knowledge to understand ourselves, 
							that the interest of that God whom we serve is our 
							interest, and that we have no other, neither in time 
							nor in eternity (<i>Deseret News</i>, 10 Sept. 1856, 
							212).</p>
<p>Though it may not be easy, we can consistently press 
						forward with faith in the Lord. I can attest that over 
						time one&#8217;s desire and capacity to always remember and 
						follow the Savior will grow. We should patiently work 
						toward that end and pray always for the discernment and 
						divine help we need. Nephi counseled, &#8220;But behold, I say 
						unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that 
						ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the 
						first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of 
						Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto 
						thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy 
						soul&#8221; (2 Nephi 32:9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I witnessed a simple example of this kind of prayer a 
						few weeks ago when Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were 
						assigned to conduct a video-conference interview of a 
						couple in another country. Because we are conducting 
						more and more business via video-conferences, we have a 
						studio for that purpose set up on the fifth floor of the 
						Church Administration Building where our offices are 
						located. Shortly before going up to the studio, I 
						reviewed once again the information we had collected 
						about the couple and felt I was prepared for the 
						interview. As I came to the small elevator lobby on the 
						fifth floor a few minutes before the appointed time, I 
						saw Elder Oaks sitting alone there with head bowed. In a 
						moment he raised his head and explained, &#8220;I was just 
						finishing my prayer in preparation for this interview. 
						We will need the gift of discernment.&#8221; He had not 
						neglected the most important preparation, a prayer to 
						&#8220;consecrate our performance&#8221; for our good and the Lord&#8217;s 
						glory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second aspect of always remembering the Redeemer is 
						to live conscious of the responsibility we have to 
						answer to Him for our lives. The scriptures make it 
						clear that there will be a great day of judgment when 
						the Lord shall stand to judge the nations (see 3 Nephi 
						27:16) and when every knee shall bow and every tongue 
						confess that He is the Christ (see Romans 14:11; Mosiah 
						27:31; 76:110). The individual nature and extent of that 
						judgment are best described by Amulek and Alma in the 
						Book of Mormon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><blockquote>And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and 
						being raised from this mortality to a state of 
						immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to 
						be judged according to your works.<br />
<br />
						Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have 
						hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it 
						has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, 
						for then we shall be condemned.<br />
<br />
						For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will 
						condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our 
						thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state 
						we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would 
						fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the 
						mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.<br />
<br />
						But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before 
						him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, 
						majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our 
						everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that 
						he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful 
						unto the children of men, and that he has all power to 
						save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth 
						forth fruit meet for repentance (Alma 12:12-15).</blockquote>
</p>
<p>When the Savior defined His gospel, this judgment was 
						central to it. He said,</p>
<p>Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the 
						gospel which I have given unto you&#8212;that I came into the 
						world to do the will of my Father, because my Father 
						sent me.<br /><br />And my father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the 
						cross and after that I had been lifted up upon the 
						cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have 
						been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by 
						the Father, to stand before me, to judged of their 
						works, whether they be good or whether they be evil&#8212;<br />And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, 
						according to the power of the Father I will draw all men 
						unto me, that they may be judged according to their 
						works (3 Nephi 27:13-15).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That judgment, He states, is based on our works. The 
						especially &#8220;good news&#8221; of His gospel is that He offers 
						the gift of forgiveness conditioned on our repentance. 
						Therefore, if our works include the works of repentance, 
						He forgives our sins and errors. If we reject the gift 
						of pardon, refusing to repent, then the penalties of 
						justice which He now represents are imposed. Remember He 
						said, &#8220;For behold, I, God, have suffered these things 
						for all, that they might not suffer if they would 
						repent; But if they would not repent they must suffer 
						even as I&#8221; (D&amp;C 19:16-17).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always remembering Him, therefore, means that we always 
						remember that nothing is hidden from Him. There is no 
						part of our lives, whether act, word, or even thought, 
						that can be kept from the knowledge of the Father and 
						the Son. No cheating on a test, no instance of 
						shoplifting, no lustful fantasy or indulgence, no lie is 
						missed, overlooked, hidden, or forgotten. Whatever one 
						&#8220;gets away with&#8221; in life or manages to hide from other 
						people, he or she must still face when the inevitable 
						day comes that he or she is lifted up before Jesus 
						Christ, the God of pure and perfect justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking personally, this reality has helped impel me at 
						different times either to repentance or to avoid sin 
						altogether. On one occasion in connection with a home 
						sale, there was an error in the documentation, and I 
						found myself in a position where I was legally entitled 
						to get more money from the buyer. My real estate agent 
						asked if I wanted to keep the money, a significant 
						amount, since it was my right to do so. I thought about 
						facing the Lord, the personification of justice, and 
						trying to explain that I had a legal right to take 
						advantage of the buyer and his mistake. I couldn&#8217;t see 
						myself being very convincing, especially since I would 
						probably be asking for mercy for myself at the same 
						time. And I knew I could not live with myself if I were 
						so dishonorable as to keep the money. I replied to the 
						agent that we would stick with the deal as we all 
						understood it originally. It is worth a great deal more 
						to me than any sum of money to know that I have nothing 
						to repent of in that transaction and that I have nothing 
						to answer for regarding it when I appear before the 
						Great Judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. In my youth I once was 
						negligent in a way that later caused an injury to one of 
						my brothers. It was not major, but required some 
						stitches in his hand. I was embarrassed about it, and 
						did not own up to my stupidity at the time, and no one 
						ever knew about my role in the matter. Many years later, 
						I was praying that God would reveal to me anything in my 
						life that needed correction so that I might be found 
						more acceptable before Him, and this incident came to my 
						mind. Frankly, I had forgotten all about it. The Spirit 
						whispered to me that this was an unresolved 
						transgression that I needed to confess. I called my 
						brother and apologized and asked for his forgiveness 
						which he promptly and generously gave. On reflection I 
						realized that my embarrassment and regret would have 
						been less if I had apologized when the accident 
						happened. Of course, it would have been even better if I 
						had followed the prompting of the Spirit at the time and 
						avoided the injury to my brother altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was interesting and very significant to me that the 
						Lord had not forgotten about that event of the distant 
						past even though I had. It was a comparatively small 
						thing, but it still needed to be handled, or I would be 
						answering for it at the judgment bar when the 
						opportunity for repentance had passed. I realized once 
						again that things do not get &#8220;swept under the rug&#8221; in 
						the eternal economy of things. Sins do not take care of 
						themselves or simply fade away. They must be dealt with, 
						and the wonderful thing is that because of His atoning 
						grace they can be dealt with in a much happier and less 
						painful manner than directly satisfying offended justice 
						ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should also take heart when thinking of a judgment in 
						which nothing is overlooked because this also means that 
						no act of obedience, no kindness, no good deed however 
						small is ever forgotten, and no corresponding blessing 
						is ever withheld.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My third and final observation regarding what it means 
						always to remember Him is that we can always look to the 
						Savior for help. In the infant days of the Church, 
						really before the actual restoration of the Church as an 
						institution, Jesus counseled and comforted the two young 
						men who were working to translate the Book of Mormon and 
						who would soon have the priesthood conferred upon them, 
						Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Joseph was 23 years old 
						at the time, and Oliver 22. Persecution and other 
						obstacles were frequent if not constant. In these 
						conditions, in April 1829, the Lord spoke these words to 
						them:</p>
<p>Fear not to do good, my sons, . . . let earth and hell 
						combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, 
						they cannot prevail.</p>
<p><br />Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and sin no 
						more; perform with soberness the work which I have 
						commanded you.</p>
<p><br />Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</p>
<p><br />Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the 
						prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, 
						keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom 
						of heaven. Amen (D&amp;C 6:33-37).</p>
<p>Looking unto the Savior &#8220;in every thought&#8221; is, of 
						course, another way of saying &#8220;always remember him.&#8221; As 
						we do, we need not doubt or fear. He reminded Joseph and 
						Oliver as He reminds us that through His Atonement He 
						has been given all power in heaven and earth (see 
						Matthew 28:18) and has both the capacity and will to 
						protect us and minister to our needs&#8212;&#8220;Behold the wounds 
						which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails 
						in my hands and feet.&#8221; We need only be faithful and we 
						can rely implicitly on Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isaiah states it this way, &#8220;Hearken unto me, ye that 
						know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; 
						fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of 
						their revilings. For the moth shall eat them up like a 
						garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my 
						righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from 
						generation to generation.&#8221; (Isaiah 51:7-8; see also 
						verses 12-16.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preceding the comforting revelation to Joseph and Oliver 
						that I have just cited, the Prophet endured a poignant, 
						painful experience familiar to all of us that taught him 
						to look to the Savior and not fear the opinions, 
						pressures, and threats of men. I quote from the account 
						in our Priesthood and Relief Society manual, <i>Teachings 
						of the Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</i>:</p>
<p>On June 14, 1828, Martin Harris left Harmony, 
						Pennsylvania, taking the first 116 manuscript pages 
						translated from the gold plates to show to some of his 
						family members in Palmyra, New York. The very next day, 
						Joseph and Emma&#8217;s first child was born, a son they named 
						Alvin. The baby died that same day, and Emma&#8217;s health 
						declined until she was near death herself. The Prophet&#8217;s 
						mother later wrote: &#8220;For some time, [Emma] seemed to 
						tremble upon the verge of the silent home of her infant. 
						So uncertain seemed her fate for a season that in the 
						space of two weeks her husband never slept one hour in 
						undisturbed quiet. At the end of this time, his anxiety 
						became so great about the manuscript that he determined, 
						as his wife was now some better, that as soon as she had 
						gained a little more strength he would make a trip to 
						New York and see after the same&#8221; (Lucy Mack Smith, 
						<i>The History of Lucy Smith, Mother of the Prophet, </i>
						1844&#8211;45 
						manuscript, book 7, pp. 1&#8211;2, Church Archives, The Church 
						of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, 
						Utah ). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, at Emma&#8217;s suggestion, the Prophet left Emma in 
						her mother&#8217;s care and traveled by stagecoach to his 
						parents&#8217; home in Manchester Township, New York. The 
						Prophet&#8217;s trip covered about 125 miles and took two or 
						three days to complete. Distraught about the loss of his 
						firstborn son, worried about his wife, and gravely 
						concerned about the manuscript, Joseph neither ate nor 
						slept during the entire trip. A fellow traveler, the 
						only other passenger on the stagecoach, observed the 
						Prophet&#8217;s weakened state and insisted on accompanying 
						him for the 20-mile walk from the stagecoach station to 
						the Smith home. For the last four miles of the walk, 
						recalled the Prophet&#8217;s mother, &#8220;the stranger was under 
						the necessity of leading Joseph by his arm, for nature 
						was too much exhausted to support him any longer and he 
						would fall asleep as he stood upon his feet.&#8221;(Lucy Mack 
						Smith, <i>The History of Lucy Smith, Mother of the 
						Prophet, </i>1844&#8211;45 manuscript, book 7, p. 5, Church Archives). 
						Immediately upon reaching his parents&#8217; home, the Prophet 
						sent for Martin Harris.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martin arrived at the Smith home in the early afternoon, 
						downcast and forlorn. He did not have the manuscript, he 
						said, and did not know where it was. Hearing this, 
						Joseph exclaimed, &#8220;Oh! My God, my God. &#8230; All is lost, is 
						lost. What shall I do? I have sinned. It is I that 
						tempted the wrath of God by asking him for that which I 
						had no right to ask.&#8230; How shall I appear before the 
						Lord? Of what rebuke am I not worthy from the angel of 
						the Most High?&#8221; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the day wore on, the Prophet paced back and forth in 
						his parents&#8217; home in great distress, &#8220;weeping and 
						grieving.&#8221; The next day he left to return to Harmony, 
						where, he said, &#8220;I commenced humbling myself in mighty 
						prayer before the Lord &#8230; that if possible I might obtain 
						mercy at his hands and be forgiven of all that I had 
						done which was contrary to his will&#8221; (Quoted by Lucy 
						Mack Smith, <i>The History of Lucy Smith, Mother of the 
						Prophet</i>, 1844&#8211;45 manuscript, book 7, pp. 6&#8211;9, Church 
						Archives). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord severely chastised the Prophet for fearing man 
						more than God, but assured him he could be forgiven. 
						&#8220;Thou art Joseph,&#8221; the Lord said, &#8220;and thou wast chosen 
						to do the work of the Lord, but because of 
						transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall. But 
						remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that 
						which thou hast done which is contrary to the 
						commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, 
						and art again called to the work&#8221; (D&amp;C 3:9&#8211;10). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a time, the Lord took the Urim and Thummim and the 
						plates from Joseph. But these things were soon restored 
						to him. &#8220;The angel was rejoiced when he gave me back the 
						Urim and Thummim,&#8221; the Prophet recalled, &#8220;and said that 
						God was pleased with my faithfulness and humility, and 
						loved me for my penitence and diligence in prayer, in 
						the which I had performed my duty so well as to &#8230; be 
						able to enter upon the work of translation again&#8221; 
						(Quoted by Lucy Mack Smith, <i>The History of Lucy Smith, 
						Mother of the Prophet</i>, 1844&#8211;45 manuscript, book 7, p. 
						11, Church Archives). &nbsp;As Joseph moved forward in the 
						great work before him, he was now fortified by the sweet 
						feelings of receiving the Lord&#8217;s forgiveness and a 
						renewed determination to do His will. (See T<i>eachings of 
						the Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</i>, 69-71 
						(Chapter 5, &#8220;Repentance&#8221; introductory portion, &#8220;From the 
						Life of Joseph Smith&#8221;)).</p>
<p>As you know, the Prophet&#8217;s determination to rely upon 
						God and not fear what men could do became fixed after 
						this experience. His life thereafter was a shining 
						example of what it means to remember Christ by relying 
						upon His power and mercy. Joseph expressed this 
						understanding during his very difficult and trying 
						incarceration at Liberty, Missouri in these words: &#8220;You 
						know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very 
						much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by 
						being kept workways with the wind and the waves. 
						Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do 
						all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand 
						still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation 
						of God, and for his arm to be revealed&#8221; (D&amp;C 123:16-17).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, to &#8220;always remember him&#8221; means that we do not 
						live our lives in fear. We know that challenges, 
						disappointments, and sorrows will come to each of us in 
						different ways, but we also know that in the end, 
						because of our divine Advocate, all things can be made 
						to work together for our good (see D&amp;C 90:24 and 98:3). 
						It is the faith expressed so simply by President Gordon 
						B. Hinckley when he would say, &#8220;Things will work out.&#8221; 
						Because we always remember the Savior, we can 
						&#8220;cheerfully do all things that lie in our power,&#8221; 
						confident that His power and love for us will see us 
						through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I bless you that you will be able to always remember 
						our incomparable and divine Redeemer&#8212;that you will feel 
						the need and be able to discern and follow his will in 
						all aspects of your life, so that increasingly you will 
						be one with Him as He is one with the Father; that you 
						will always retain an awareness of your accountability 
						to the Lord to sustain you in your fight against 
						temptation, or where needed, in your repentance of any 
						sin or misdeed; and finally, that you will always have 
						with you the quiet assurance of His love and grace that 
						will enable you to withstand the assaults of the 
						adversary and his supporters and to feel the comfort and 
						reality of your Lord&#8217;s protecting care. I bless you that 
						the promise to those who always remember Him &#8211; &#8220;that 
						they may always have his spirit to be with them,&#8221; (D&amp;C 
						20 77:79) will be fully realized in your life. I bear my 
						witness of the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I 
						bear witness of the reality of the living, resurrected 
						Lord. I bear witness of the infinite and personal love 
						of the Father and the Son for each of you, and pray that 
						you will live in constant remembrance of that love in 
						all its expressions.</p>

<p><i>	Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are happy to be here 
						today among you amazing students. You look pretty darn 
						good, for two in the afternoon.&nbsp;I guess the real test 
						now is will you be able to stay awake after a good 
						lunch. </p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I was on this campus was for the 
						dedication of the Hinckley Building, and I can tell you 
						it has been sweet today to go to that building and 
						remember that great event. President Hinckley was so 
						pleased that day, and I think he would be pleased this 
						day to see how that building is being used. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are an inspiring sight. You are such a great mix of people. 
						You come from all circumstances &#8211; some come from 
						pioneer ancestry, some are converts, some come from 
						functional and some from dysfunctional homes. Some are 
						rich and some are poor. But you know what? Right now 
						it doesn&#8217;t really matter because you have all found your 
						way here. Regardless of your background, you are now all 
						under the same umbrella. You are young people with 
						great potential. And the Lord will use your 
						circumstances and your challenges to teach and to develop you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; At our age, we have tasted a little bit of life. As a 
						matter of fact, we both lost our spouses after more than 
						40 years of marriage and we thought life was over with. 
						But instead it was just the close of one chapter and the 
						beginning of another. You know that&#8217;s the way the Lord 
						works when our lives are on the right pathway. When one 
						door closes, He opens another. And so it has been with 
						us. Here we are just having celebrated, three days ago, our fifth wedding anniversary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have to tell you I had a very different life growing up. My 
						father died when I was just a few days short of my one 
						year old birthday. My mother was 30 years old at the 
						time, and she never remarried. She lived as a widow for 
						64 years and just died about seven years ago. Although I 
						trusted her and loved her and idolized her, I grew up 
						with a real chip on my shoulder. I thought Heavenly 
						Father must not have loved me or why would he have taken 
						my father when I needed him so badly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately I had a dear friend, an older man who was serving in the 
						military. He spent a lot of time with me. One day I was 
						out in his pigeon coop with him and we were talking. Suddenly he turned to me and said words to this effect: 
						&quot;Richard, when I look at you, there are times when I&#8217;d 
						like to kick your rear end right up around your neck.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was stunned. I said, &quot;Why would you say that to me?&quot; </p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Because I have watched you, and you have this big chip on your 
						shoulder. You think the Lord has done you a big 
						disservice.&nbsp;The trouble is that this is limiting your 
						life and until you get rid of the chip you will never be 
						happy. You have endless potential, and if you will 
						shake this and get rid of this chip, there is nothing in 
						life that you can&#8217;t have.";</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was so hard to hear. I shed a lot of tears but I finally began to 
						realize he was right. It was a struggle, but when it 
						finally over came this, my whole life changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to his, my life was rather uneventful. But it 
						was good. I grew up in a home with a mother and father 
						who loved the Lord, who loved each other, and who loved 
						us. It was not a perfect home. But it was a home that 
						provided security and structure. I felt valued and 
						trusted as a child and really normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years have taught me that the Lord works with us regardless of our 
						background and to the extent that we cooperate he can 
						make something pretty magnificent out of each one of 
						us. You are going the right direction. You have 
						gathered on this campus with a common mission &#8211; to get 
						an education. In addition you are developing life 
						skills that will carry you into the world and enable you 
						to meet the challenges that lie ahead. </p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
						you well know, secular education costs a lot of money. It means if you want to be successful, you must go to 
						class, take notes, go to labs, study the material, take 
						tests, write papers and pass the course. And hopefully 
						at the end of the road you end up with a degree and a 
						job. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to law school after I was married and had three children. It 
						was not easy. I was working to support my family, I was 
						the elder&#8217;s quorum president, and I was studying every 
						spare minute I had. There were times when I wanted to 
						give up. There were times when I was tempted to miss 
						class or blow off a paper because I was too tired. It 
						took much sacrifice, time, and money. But in the end, I 
						earned a Juris Doctorate of Law. And it has been worth 
						it. It has blessed my life in remarkable ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is another kind of education that not only is <i>important</i>, 
						but is <i>imperative </i>to our spiritual exaltation. That education takes place in the House of the Lord, the 
						temple, which Brigham Young referred to as the Lord&#8217;s 
						spiritual university on earth. It is that education 
						that we would like to speak of today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; When we were called to the temple three years ago, I was 
						clueless.&nbsp;I had always been a regular temple patron. I 
						loved the temple and had had some sweet experiences 
						associated with temple worship, but I must admit there 
						were many times when I would struggle to stay awake, or 
						I would look at my watch and wonder if I was going to 
						make it to the next appointment.&nbsp;Sometimes I went because it was on my &quot;to do&quot; list and I like checking 
						things off my list. But when we began our three-year 
						service, new vistas opened to me and I began to see and 
						feel temple worship in a new way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
						have in this community a beautiful new temple&nbsp;&#8211; the 
						Rexburg Temple. We were there this morning and went 
						through it. What a gorgeous temple this is. I am told 
						that many of you go there often &#8211; some of you serve in 
						the temple, many more attend the temple. I would 
						suspect that all of you have driven by, looked at it, 
						and marveled at its beauty. I ask you though, is that 
						enough? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly it is not. Education in the Lord's spiritual university means 
						we not only have to go, but we have to go prepared to 
						learn. This requires continuous preparation, 
						dedication, time, study, pondering and prayer. 
						</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have often thought, &quot;What if during my law school years, I had 
						decided it was just too tough and too time consuming and 
						so I would just drive by the law school two or three 
						times a week and look at it, admire its beauty, and then 
						occasionally I would even walk inside and look in the 
						halls, maybe drop into the library and look at all those 
						books, and now and then go to a class. I would do this 
						for 3 years and then ask the dean for a degree. You know 
						what would happen. I wouldn&#8217;t have a chance of 
						succeeding.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this campus there are hundreds maybe even thousands of things you 
						could learn if you took the class, studied the material, 
						searched and then pondered what you learn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the temple there are an equal or greater number of things to be 
						learned. But we have to &quot;take the class&quot; as it were, 
						studied the material, and searched and pondered and 
						prayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we will give you just a glimpse of what is 
						available to you as you search the principles that are 
						taught in the House of the Lord. We hope this will whet 
						your appetite for more. In doing so we use a little 
						formula that we call <i>The Principle, the Savior and Me. </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s a bit like a &quot;connect 
						the dots puzzle.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:&nbsp; </i>It is very simple; it is just this: When you sit in the 
						temple, any part of temple including the baptistery, 
						listen carefully for the doctrinal principles that are 
						being taught. You will find that almost every sentence 
						of the ordinances offered, teaches a principle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have identified the doctrinal principle, then ask 
						yourself, &quot;How does it relate to the Savior?&quot; &#8211; 
						remembering that everything in the temple relates to the 
						Savior, his divinity and his atonement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you ask yourself, &quot;What does this mean to me and 
						how do I use it in my life?&quot;&nbsp;Now you have the three 
						parts of the puzzle: the Principle, the Savior and Me!</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let&#8217;s give you a couple of simple examples.&nbsp;Remember first of all you identify the <i>principle</i>. 
						Identify it with a sentence not just a word like faith 
						or repentance, but a complete sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a fundamental principle that we all learn at an early 
						age. It is taught in the first Primary song we learn to 
						sing. You all know what it is: &quot;<i>I Am a Child of God 
						and I am individually important to my Heavenly Father</i>.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This principle is taught both in the temple and in the scriptures. Think 
						of the baptistery, which I understand you load, beginning at 6:00 a.m. every morning. When you do 
						baptisms for the dead, wouldn&#8217;t it be far more efficient 
						and time saving if, when you stood in the water, the 
						officiator read off 10 names or 50 or a 100, and then 
						immersed you in the water one time for all those people? 
						Last year in the Salt Lake Temple there were 447,000 
						baptisms done for the dead. We could have done those so 
						much faster and with greater efficiency with such a program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that is not the Lord&#8217;s way. Those baptisms, indeed every ordinance 
						in the temple, is done for one person at a time. What 
						does that tell you? It tells me that I am important to 
						Heavenly Father and that he loves me as an individual. He does not see me as part of the masses. He sees me as 
						an individual child of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, now we know what the principle is. So now we ask 
						ourselves, <i>&quot;How does this principle relate to the 
						Savior?&quot; </i>The Savior so loved us as individuals that 
						he was willing to suffer and die and atone for our sins 
						in order that we might return to our Father in Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am convinced that the Savior&#8217;s love for every individual is 
						so great, that if somehow his atonement had missed me or 
						had missed one of you, he would come back and do it all 
						over again just for me or for you, because He loves us 
						so deeply and we are so important to him.</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, <i>How does this apply to me and how do I use this 
						in my life</i>? It tells me that the Lord knows me and 
						considers me a child of great worth, and I need to live 
						my life in accordance with his teachings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is another example: There is a principle taught 
						both in the temple and in the scriptures that is: <i>Men and women are 
						created differently, by design. </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember the story of Adam and Eve being tempted by Lucifer. 
						Lucifer knew of their differences and used this to serve 
						his purposes. </p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you remember when he approached Adam? He appealed to his 
						intellect &#8211; he said &quot;Here, it will make you wise.&quot; And 
						Adam flatly refused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; When 
						he approached Eve he used words that appealed to her 
						sensitivities as a woman. Words such as <i>delicious</i> 
						and <i>desirable</i><b>.</b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is recorded in Moses:&nbsp; </p>
<p>When the woman saw that the tree was <i>good</i><b> </b>for food, and 
						that it became <i>pleasant</i> to the eyes and a tree to 
						be <i>desired</i> to make her <i>wise</i>, she took of 
						the fruit and&nbsp;did eat. (Moses 4:12)</p>
<p>Eve had those nurturing qualities and remembered they had been 
						commanded to multiply and replenish the earth. Her 
						understanding led her to partake and the law of the Lord 
						was fulfilled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; All right, now ask yourself: &quot;<i>How 
						does this relate to the Savior?&quot; </i>The fall was necessary to <i>&quot;bring to 
						pass the immortality and eternal life of man</i>.&quot; That 
						difference between Adam and Eve brought forth the need 
						for a redeemer and Savior and put into place, the entire 
						Plan of Salvation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the hard part: <i>How does that apply to me? </i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of resisting these differences, we ought to embrace them, 
						use them and rejoice in them. They have been given to 
						us for a purpose. When we put them together they make a 
						whole.&nbsp;Remember when Adam and Eve left the garden they 
						went hand in hand, side by side.&nbsp;She was not saying, 
						&quot;Oh, Adam, I&#8217;m so sorry! I didn&#8217;t know what to do!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was not saying &quot;Honestly, woman! But for you I could 
						be luxuriating in the Garden. Instead, here I am digging rocks and pulling weeds!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; You women &#8211; have you noticed that men don&#8217;t respond the way 
						you think they are supposed to?&nbsp;You drop every kind of 
						hint that your birthday is coming up &#8211; even telling them 
						the date and what you want. And the birthday comes, and nothing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;And then men, have you noticed that when you forget, she cries? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how many of you heard the little ad on the 
						radio that aired just before Christmas. It was for a 
						jewelry store. There is this couple, and she is opening 
						her Christmas present. They have a little exchange that 
						goes something like this. She says:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Oh, diamond earrings. They are just what I wanted! </p>
<p>How did you know! Oh, I love them! Thank you!</p>
<p>
<i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then his response&#8230;</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, wait a minute. You took us to the store. </p>
<p>You picked them out. You paid for them. </p>
<p>You brought them home. You wrapped them.</p>
<p>You put them under the tree! </p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t spoil this moment! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; These are really light and inconsequential examples, unless 
						you choose to let the differences turn into a war. But 
						when you use these differences to complement one 
						another, you can accomplish things you cannot do on your 
						own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:&nbsp;</i> 
						This is a principle that is not only true in a marriage, but in any relationship. It works on a committee, in a 
						ward council, in your home, in the work place, in a social setting. It even happened to us the other night 
						when we were reading the scriptures:&nbsp;We were reading D&amp;C, section 109:22.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And we ask thee Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this 
						house armed with thy power and that thy name may be upon 
						them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them. </p>
<p>I love this scripture because it is so visual. It paints a picture 
						in my mind. I see myself floating out of the temple, 
						dressed in white, with angels floating over me, protecting me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp;I picture myself leaving the temple in a full coat 
						of armor with breastplate and shield in hand and with 
						the name of Christ emblazoned across my chest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp; Viva la difference! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; So again:&nbsp; <i>What does this principle mean in our 
						lives? </i>It means in order for us to succeed, we must learn to embrace the differences, rejoice in the 
						differences, learn from the differences, use the differences in accomplishing common purposes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have shared just two little examples, but we would challenge you to 
						begin your quest in search of what you can personally 
						learn from your temple experience. Remember, look for 
						the principle; ask how it relates to the Savior and then 
						how it relates to me. And then apply it. The <i>
						Principle, the Savior and Me! </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is inscribed on every temple, including the Rexburg 
						Temple, this statement: &quot;<i>Holiness to the Lord, The 
						House of the Lord.&quot;</i> President Hinckley has said 
						that it might say, &quot;<i>Holiness is the House of the 
						Lord.&quot; </i>This means exactly what it says. Because of 
						this, there is nothing that happens in the temple by 
						chance. It is a place of exactness and of personal revelation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:&nbsp;</i> One day when I was in the temple, a woman stopped me and 
						said, &quot;Oh, Sister Walker, it must be wonderful to spend 
						so much time in the temple.&nbsp;I bet you have had lots of visions!&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
						This caught me a little off guard. I have never had a vision, in the 
						context of great visions. But as I thought about it, it occured to me that I don&#8217;t seek a vision nor do I need a 
						vision because every day that I was in the temple I had 
						feelings that came to my heart and thoughts that came 
						into my mind that testified to me of the divinity of the Lord&#8217;s work. </p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 8th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord is 
						teaching Oliver Cowdery and the Prophet Joseph the process of personal revelation. He says: </p>
<p>Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy 
						Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell 
						in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.... (D&amp;C 8:2-3)</p>
<p>Very often people go to the temple seeking refuge, help, peace, and 
						personal revelation. The temple is a place where the 
						Lord can communicate with us in individual ways if our hearts are prepared to receive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a year ago I had a letter from a woman who related this story. She 
						said that she had married a man who was not a member of 
						the Church. Together they had had five children, and 
						they had had a good life. But recently their oldest 
						daughter had come to them and said she was in love with 
						a member of a polygamist family and she wanted to marry 
						him. As a result, she was going to pull away from her own family and her religion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This mother was devastated. She said, &quot;I didn&#8217;t know what to say, I 
						didn&#8217;t know what to do, I didn&#8217;t know how to handle this.&quot; </p>
<p>It was her stake temple day that week and so she decided to go and spend 
						the entire day in the temple. She started in the baptistery that morning. She said,</p>
<p>I just began with a prayer in my heart and felt somehow the Lord 
						would be mindful of my need and help me with this terrible problem.</p>
<p>Early in the day, a thought came into her mind, and she heard herself say 
						these words to her daughter, &quot;It will be very sad for us 
						when someday we go to the temple as a family and you are 
						not with us.&quot; But she immediately brushed it aside 
						thinking, &quot;There is no way I can make such a promise. My 
						husband is not even a member of the Church.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She spent the day doing some endowment sessions, and that thought 
						continued to come to her. But each time this thought 
						came, she discounted it. Late in the day while 
						participating in an ordinance she said, </p>
<p>I was just overcome with this sweet sense of 
							gratitude. I knew that the Lord knew that we were 
							having a problem. I didn&#8217;t know what to do, but I 
							knew the Lord knew and He would help me. </p>
<p>And so it was in the ensuing weeks she had an opportunity to visit with 
						her daughter. She said, </p>
<p>In the course of the conversation, I heard myself saying the very 
						words that had come to me that day in the temple. &quot;It will be very sad for us when we go to be sealed as a 
						family and you are not with us.&quot;</p>
<p>The remarkable thing is, the daughter responded. She found the courage 
						to break up the relationship. And she subsequently met 
						and they are planning a temple marriage. She then added this postscript: </p>
<p>Last week after nearly a year of learning the gospel through the love 
						and patience of eight dedicated sister missionary, my husband has finally arrived at a baptismal date. 
						</p>
<p>This is a woman who paid attention to the thoughts that came into her mind and the feelings that came into her heart that day 
						when she was in the temple. She then took those feelings and thoughts into her home, and she saved a daughter. 
						Nothing in the temple happens by chance. Pay attention when you are there. Listen to your heart and your 
						thoughts and the Lord will school you and help you.</p>
<p>	&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i> </p>
<p> <i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Think what the Lord has promised each of us, to you and to 
						me: In the 97<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord said this:&nbsp; </p>
<p>And inasmuch as 	my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, 
						and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, 
						that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and <i>all the pure in heart 
							</i>that shall come into it <i>shall see God</i>. (D&amp;C 97:15-16, emphasis added)</p>
<p>I know that you can witness the Lord&#8217;s presence in 
						the temple and as you purify your heart you will come to 
						know God through spiritual eyes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes you hear talk of how thin the veil is in the temple. Let me 
						tell you. A short time ago in the Salt Lake Temple, we 
						had such an experience. A young couple came to the 
						temple. They had come from Sri Lanka to have their 
						family sealed in the temple. They were a beautiful young 
						couple with two beautiful children. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wife was to receive her own endowment, and then the family would be 
						sealed. Before the endowment, the temple president and 
						matron give instructions to those who are there for the 
						first time. We did that on this day. It was so 
						beautiful. We were both touched by young couple. With 
						tears in their eyes, they expressed deep gratitude for 
						the privilege of being in Salt Lake City in the Salt 
						Lake Temple. This had always been a far off dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the instruction period, Sister Walker said to me, &quot;Do you 
						have any idea who is performing the sealing today?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;I really don&#8217;t.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said, &quot;Why don&#8217;t you call upstairs and ask?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I did. I was told that no one had yet been assigned. And then Sister 
						Walker said to me, &quot;Why don&#8217;t you go do it?&quot; Now 
						brethren, this is evidence of the fact that some of our 
						greatest inspiration will come from the women in our lives. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the time came, we went upstairs to the sealing rooms. They 
						brought this beautiful young couple in and with tears 
						running down their cheeks they received the eternal 
						ordinance that joined them together forever. Then they 
						brought the little four year old boy in. He was dressed 
						in white, and was the picture of reverence. His arms 
						were folded and he didn&#8217;t make a peep. We had to have 
						him step up and stand on the cushion at the side of the 
						altar so he could put his little hand on top of his 
						parents while the sealing took place. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then they brought his little sister in, eight months old, 
						screaming at the top of her lungs. She had been away 
						from her mother for more than two hours, and even her 
						mother could not console her. She continued to scream, 
						and so we proceeded by sitting her on the altar with 
						her back turned to me. Her grandmother forcibly held 
						her little hand on top of her brother&#8217;s hand so that I 
						could perform the sealing. This little girl continued to 
						scream until I came to the point where I said, &quot;And I 
						seal you,&quot; (naming her), &quot;to your father,&quot; (naming him), 
						&quot;and to your mother&quot; (naming her)&quot;. Instantly she 
						stopped crying. She turned around and stared at me with 
						big beautiful dark eyes. She remained completely 
						silent until I said &quot;amen&quot; and then a huge smile came 
						across her face. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, I am convinced that that little girl physically had no idea 
						what was happening in her life. She was too young. But 
						spiritually, she knew. The Lord had taught her. Is it 
						any wonder why He says unless you become as a little 
						child, ye cannot enter the kingdom of God (3 Nephi 
						11:38). Her heart was pure and the Lord had granted her 
						a kind of understanding that transcends our mortal 
						knowledge.&nbsp;Glimpse of eternity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So also in the temple, the veil will become very 
						thin. I testify that each of you can and will be taught 
						by the Spirit if you will go there worthily and with 
						your hearts prepared. Now your formal education at this 
						institution will at some point end. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the education you can achieve in the temple, in the 
						House of the Lord, will never end. It will require a 
						lifetime of study, hard work, prayer, pondering and 
						applying what you learn in the temple, to obtain the 
						promised blessings. </p>
<p>	Your formal education has the potential of awarding you a degree in 
						your chosen field. But your spiritual education in 
						temple has the potential of awarding you happiness in 
						life and eternal exaltation in the presence of God.</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley has said that the work of the temples is 
						absolutely essential to our happiness<i>. </i>He also 
						added: <i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>I am satisfied that every man or woman who goes 
							to the temple in a spirit of sincerity and faith 
							leaves the House of the Lord a better man and better 
							woman. (<i>Ensign</i>, 
						Nov. 1995, 53)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Kathleen:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The blessings of the temple are real. I would plead with 
						you wonderful young people, don&#8217;t deprive yourself of 
						these blessings. Go to the temple with inquiring minds. 
						Search for the principles that are being taught. Listen 
						to your heart and your mind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at you today; and frankly, I wonder what you have ever done to 
						deserve what you have: an education at this great 
						institution, a temple almost next door. I don&#8217;t know 
						what you have done, but you must have done something 
						spectacular. Surely you are a chosen generation and the 
						Lord is preparing you for great things. Don&#8217;t blow it! 
						He will bless you. He will magnify you. He will make 
						something of you, and then He will use you to further 
						his work. My temple experience has been life changing. I 
						would pray that yours may be the same. I know without 
						question a temple is the House of the Lord and His 
						spirit is always there. May you come to understand that 
						in a very personal way, I pray in the name of Jesus 
						Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Richard:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; May I just conclude with reminding you of two brief things. 
						The Prophet Nephi taught: </p>
<p>And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power;&#8230;for 
						he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they 
						dwell in righteousness&#8230;. (1 Nephi 22:26)</p>
<p>So also is it in the House of the Lord. Satan has no power there. He 
						cannot go there&#8211;unless you take him in. If you are there 
						in righteousness, you are out of his reach. Now the Lord 
						has given great promises to his faithful saints as 
						contained in the 124<sup>th</sup> section of the 
						Doctrine and Covenants. Listen to what He promises:</p>
<p>I command you again to build a house to my name, even in this place, 
						that you may prove yourselves unto me that you are faithful in all things whatsoever I command you, that I 
						may bless you, and crown you with honor, immortality, 
						and eternal life. (D&amp;C 124:55)</p>
<p>	I bear you my solemn witness that I know beyond question that God 
						lives, that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, our 
						Redeemer. This building standing on the hill is 
						literally His Holy House. And I testify to you that He 
						teaches there daily to those who come with hearts 
						prepared to be taught of the spirit. May that be your 
						blessing. May you recognize that your happiness in life 
						is tied to the House of the Lord. May God bless you to 
						that end. May His choicest blessings rest upon you, I 
						pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

President and Sister Clark, brothers and sisters, I am genuinely honored to be with you today. I appreciate the privilege of addressing you. I pray that I may be guided by the Spirit of the Lord to say that which is true and that which for someone may prove helpful. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I have thought to speak with you regarding <em>opportunity</em>. It seems a fitting topic for ones engaged so deeply in the business of preparation as you are. Opportunity does knock on the doors of our lives, however on occasion it knocks very softly, perhaps disguised as something other than what it is. It may appear to be a problem, a challenge, or even a disaster. Yet if invited in, it often proves to be a good gift. Neither does opportunity always knock at the front door, as one might expect of a guest. It may come to the back door, as something more ordinary, even homely. If we are aware of it&rsquo;s penchant for disguises, we will become more alert to possibilities in strange shapes. We will open the door with some enhanced sense of excitement and adventure. We will anticipate that whatever the vehicle of delivery &mdash; there will eventually be revealed a form of opportunity. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A Book of Mormon Prophet taught the need for <em>opposition </em>in <em>all </em>things&rdquo; (2 Nephi 2:11). It may also be the case &mdash; that for the faith filled seeker &mdash; there is just as certainly <em>opportunity</em> in <em>all</em> things. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As a young graduate student I had an experience with just such a disguised opportunity. I had been assigned by my professor to write a paper on a particular topic. I did so in a rather hurried fashion and submitted it at the time appointed. I thought little more about it until it was returned to me with a note indicating that, &ldquo;...he could not even grade my work as a scholarly paper, because it was nothing more than a conversation one might have with a friend.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
His note devastated me! I was married with two daughters. I needed to graduate and get into the work force. I needed to start making money to support my family, and it appeared that this botched project so late in the school year might thwart all of that. I could hardly go home to Estella that night. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
After a day of suffering I returned to my professor. &ldquo;What can I do now?&rdquo; was my question. He outlined a rigorous pathway of recovery that at the time seemed hardly doable. However, my circumstance left me little alternative but to try. This set back later revealed itself to be an opportunity in disguise &mdash; one of the most valuable of my formal training. I think, with appreciation, of Professor Dodson. I have privately admired his courage in requiring of me that which I did not know was mine to give. I suppose he is long since gone and most likely was never fully aware of his contribution to my life &mdash; an opportunity disguised as failure. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With all of that said, let me share some rather wide ranging thoughts about the topic at hand, how personal it can be, how uniquely designed for each individual, and their specific circumstance at issue. By nature <em>opportunity</em> is both <em>delicate</em> and <em>fragile</em>. It typically requires a good bit of<em> nurturing</em>. On occasion it may even need rescuing by some extreme effort. Seldom, if ever, does it impose itself upon us. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The 2008 &mdash; 2009 football season has just ended. What was once considered a fall sport now begins in August and ends in February. The recent bowl season has put me in mind of the 1969 Orange Bowl game between The University of Kansas (coached by Pepper Rogers) and Penn State University (coached by the now legendary Joe Paterno). That was 39 years ago as of this last season. I remember it for the intricate and complex manner in which it played out. I remember it because of the unusual and delicate circumstances upon which opportunity came or went for one team or the other. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At half-time the score was 7 to 7. In the second half, Kansas scored for a 14 to 7 lead which lasted until only 15 seconds remained on the clock. The Kansas coach had earlier passed up an almost certain field goal try at the Penn State five yard line with fourth and one to go. A field goal would have clinched the game for them. The play they ran instead failed &mdash; giving Penn State their opportunity. From the five yard line, with 15 seconds to go they scored. And now, rather than a 17-13 score, it was a 14 to13 and Penn State could win with a two point conversion. To quote a <em>Sports Illustrated </em>article, &ldquo;At this point Joe Paterno, who will always go for broke, decided to try for two points. &lsquo;If we couldn&rsquo;t win, we&rsquo;d lose&rsquo;, he said later. It looked like lose when Penn State&rsquo;s conversion pass...was knocked down.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>
However, the umpire had noticed, before the play began, that Kansas had 12 men on the field. He knew he would need to throw a flag. <br />
<br />
Again, from <em>Sports Illustrated:</em>
</p>
<p>
	It was the fluttering red handkerchief.....that alerted Kansas and the world to the fact that the Jayhawks might not have won the Orange bowl after all. The penalty was marked off, and this time Penn State, not outnumbered, was able to get its two points.......The result was the 15-14 victory, (and) an undefeated season. 
	</p>
<p>
Penn State&rsquo;s opportunity had come as a result of unexpected and complex circumstances allowing them an adequate number of chances to win. In other words, they had been given the <em>opportunity to repent</em>! Without it they were certain losers. What was it worth&mdash;the privilege of doing again that which was not done well enough the first time? In linking football with the notion of repentance there is no disrespect intended. There is something to learn from the comparison. For one thing: the need for another chance on the part of Penn State was not due to any frivolous error or planned mistake&mdash;no lack of commitment or effort. They had, in the words of the scripture played with &ldquo;a sincere heart and real intent&rdquo; (Moroni 10:4). There was no deceit involved in their need for another chance. So how much is the privilege of repentance worth? How much to be desired, the opportunity to redo some elements of even the true and faithful life&mdash;let alone, a life that may have drifted off-course. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As with other applications, so also can <em>spiritual opportunities</em> be<em> intricate </em>and <em>delicate</em>. Spiritual victories often depend on multiple well intended chances in order to win. Not only may it require the scriptural &ldquo;seventy times seven&rdquo; but as Brigham Young explained it: &ldquo;Do not throw away a man or a woman, old or young. If they commit an evil today, and another tomorrow,<em> but wish to be Saints and to be forgiven</em>, do you forgive them &mdash; not only seven times, but seventy times seven <em>in a day</em>, <u>if their hearts are fully set to do right</u>. Let us make it a point to pass over their weaknesses and say, &lsquo;God bless you in trying to be better in time to come,&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Discourses of Brigham Young</em>, Widtsoe, p.277). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How many opportunities does repentance provide for the sincere and honest in heart? By the estimation of Brigham Young, &ldquo; &mdash; as many as it takes!&quot; Walter Malone, a late nineteenth century poet captured the essence of such <em>opportunity to repent</em> with these lines: 
</p>
<p>
	They do me wrong who say I come no more 
	</p>
<p>
	When once I knock and fail to find you in; 
	</p>
<p>
	For every day I stand outside your door 
	</p>
<p>
	And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.<br />
<br />
	Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast? 
	</p>
<p>
	Dost reel from righteous retribution&rsquo;s blow? 
	</p>
<p>
	Then turn from blotted archives of the past 
	</p>
<p>
	And find the future&rsquo;s pages white as snow<br />
<br />
	Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep;<br />
	I lend my arm to all who say &ldquo;I Can!&rdquo;<br />
	No shame-faced outcast ever sank so deep<br />
	But yet might rise and be again a man!<br />
	(<em>The Little Book of American Poets &mdash;1787 &mdash; 1900</em>) 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The authorization making all of these opportunities for personal improvement possible is, of course, the <em>Infinite and Atoning Sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ</em>. Jacob taught: 
</p>
<p>
	He cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, who belong to the family of Adam. (2 Nephi 9:21) 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One. Remember that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name. (2 Nephi 9:41) 
	</p>
<p>
	Possibly the hardest guidelines for us to follow are those we set for ourselves. To analyze our fears, our dreams, our goals, our motives can be soul-wrenching. We may find that we fear failure so much that we won&rsquo;t take a risk. Often our self-esteem is bruised by criticism. It is natural to assume that everyone else has his life under control and doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with dark little weaknesses and imperfections. There is a natural, probably a mortal, tendency to compare ourselves with others. Unfortunately, when we make these comparisons, we tend to compare our weakest attributes with someone else&rsquo;s strongest. Obviously these kinds of comparisons are destructive and only reinforce the fear that somehow we don&rsquo;t measure up and therefore we must not be as worthy as the next person. (On Being Worthy, <em>Ensign</em>, May 1989) 
	</p>
<p>
To be certain, there is much of <em>opportunity</em> in the thoughtful consideration of our strengths and weaknesses. Kind and well-intended sharing by others can be useful in the process. We must be honest with ourselves in the appraisal of what can and should be done by way of the obvious need for improvement that we all have. At the same time, we cannot afford to become weak and doubting because we took too seriously the unkind comments of others or more tragically because we have become the victim of our own <em>negative</em> self assessment. 
</p>

<p>
These good people were taught the gospel. They believed and asked to be baptized. After the qualifying progress had been made, they came to the Billings Montana Temple to be sealed. Their two children, who had each one died in infancy, were ultimately sealed with them into an eternal family unit. At the conclusion of this remarkable chain of events, the mother &mdash; contemplating the meaning of it all &mdash; spoke softly, &ldquo;O, forever. I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
She and her family were now included as recipients of the temple&rsquo;s highest ordinances and most sacred opportunities. They had come to know that the temple is the Lord&rsquo;s great <em>instrument of inclusion</em>. That while only a short time ago they were simply subscribers to a magazine &mdash; they were now &ldquo;no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God&rdquo; (Ephesians 2: 19). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It seems ironic that a common perception of many is that our church doctrines and our people are exclusive. Ironic, in fact, because the whole intent of the Great Plan of Happiness is to include everyone &mdash; that all might be partakers of His hope. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I learned something of how prophets feel about those who may be left on the outside looking in &mdash; or in other words <em>excluded</em>. It is a simple story, but one that for me conveyed a powerful message. Some years ago I had been asked to make a brief report to the Church Board of Education regarding some things that were being done here to allow more students to attend our school. (I notice from a recent press release that you continue working to make that happen.) I made my report with some emphasis on how many fewer had been denied admission during the current year than had been the case for the previous year. It was a significant number, in the thousands. In retrospect, I think I may have sounded more pleased with that progress than I wish I had. As the report was concluded, there seemed a momentary silence, and then President Hinckley asked: &ldquo;What happened to the &ldquo;<em>few</em>&rdquo; who were still not admitted?&rdquo; His thought was not about the <em>many </em>who were in, but rather about the <em>few</em> who were not. With prophets as with temples the point is the inclusion of all who wish it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The temple affords the opportunity to <em>learn</em>. It is the Lord&rsquo;s <em>House</em> and among other things it is a <em>House of Learning.</em> Church leaders have called it the Lord&rsquo;s University to emphasize the point. Unlike other universities, however, this one has few faculty &mdash; really only one. In the temple it is the Holy Ghost who teaches &mdash; and what we learn there, we learn from Him. &ldquo;But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,...&rdquo; (John 14:26). Temple learnings are as personal as they are sacred. They are not to be spoken of outside the temple and only with rare exception inside. We do not attempt explanation of what we learn in the temple, even though we may have been granted some clearer insight. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In this regard, Nephi made it clear to his family that he was teaching them certain sacred things relative to their father&rsquo;s vision because &ldquo;the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these things, and deny them not&rdquo;.(1 Nephi 10:22). Although he was teaching because the Holy Ghost had authorized his doing so, it is equally clear that he was not authorized to teach certain other things. On a later occasion he said, &ldquo;And now I, Nephi, make and end; for I durst not speak further as yet concerning these things&rdquo; (1 Nephi 22: 29). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Prophet Alma taught similarly: 
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God, nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him. (Alma 12:9) 
	</p>
<p>
So among the many blessings associated with temple worship is the opportunity to <em>learn</em>. Learning that will be facilitated &ldquo;according to our diligence and heed&rdquo; and may be granted more liberally to those that can be depended upon not to &ldquo;impart&rdquo; that which is sacred. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Sometimes youth feel that opportunity is only a future proposition for them; older folks are sure it is in their past and long gone &mdash; neither fully realizing just how much they matter and how singular and significant their &ldquo;moment&rdquo; is in the grand scheme of things. When President Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the Billings Montana Temple, he said that the temple belonged to the young people who would come there, as much as to their parents. (See: Billings Montana Temple Dedication Services) The implication was that the youth also would have the opportunity to learn, and grow, and have their hearts purified. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In that spirit, two youth, a young man age 12 and a young woman age 14, came to the temple. They were not brother and sister, but both were members of the same small church unit. The two young persons were accompanied by five adults which will tell you something of their value to the kingdom. In coming they traveled a total of eight hours to and from their homes. That is <em>far</em> by some standards &mdash; <em>not so far</em> by others. In any case, it was part of the price they willingly paid to make a faithful offering unto the Lord. As we sang a hymn together the spirit witnessed powerfully of their goodness and of their desire to be of service. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There appeared to be no ulterior social component to their coming. No shopping time, no much to be anticipated eating out experience, no fun activity to make it all worth while. Only travel, service and more travel. It could not have been more ordinary in terms of youth coming to the temple and it could not have been more extra-ordinary in terms of how it felt to have them there. In any case, we learned through them, and others like them, that with God opportunity is not determined by age or numbers, only by the reaching out of pure and honest hearts. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it was of such reaching out that Emma Lou Thayne wrote: 
</p>
<p>
	Where can I turn for peace? 
	</p>
<p>
	Where is my solace (w)hen other sources cease to make me whole? 
	</p>
<p>
	...He answers &mdash; <em>privately, Reaches my reaching</em>
</p>
<p>
	In <em>my</em> Gethsemane, Savior and Friend. <br />
	(emphasis added, See <em>Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em> &ndash;&ndash; Hymn number 129) 
	</p>
<p>
My purpose, and my hope in addressing you today is to testify that of all the <em>opportunities</em> possible for mankind, the most to be desired is the knowing of&nbsp; &ldquo;Where [We Can] Turn for Peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; I witness that through the power of His Atoning Sacrifice, He literally reaches our reaching, and thereby we discover the assurance of His being and the certainty of His love. Through that reaching, our witness will become certain, our vision clear, and the privileges of His Kingdom more appreciated. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;

<p>I am grateful to be able to address you this beautiful day. The invitation to be here has been a blessing to me. I have studied and prayed about the topic, I have enjoyed rich spiritual experiences in the process. My message will cover two topics: first, the plans of the Manwaring Center and the new Auditorium; and second, the vision as I understand it for both buildings.
						</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We do not often equate the construction world with spiritual events. The Lord does. We can reference Noah and the arc, Moses and the tabernacle of the congregation, the temples of Israel, the Jaredite barges, Nephi&#39;s ship, the Kirtland temple, the Nauvoo temple, development of the smaller temples as led by President Hinckley, and the buildings on the BYU-Idaho campus as spiritual events. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Over the last two years I have conducted interviews with the <em>Scroll</em> and others to describe the Manwaring Center addition and remodel and the new Auditorium. I never know how many read and understand the scope of the projects. I am going to share with you today the plans for the building and some artist concepts of the interiors and exteriors. I hope that they will be a benefit to you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The construction of the Manwaring Center is split into three phases. The first phase was the construction of the addition to the north that was completed in 2008. The second phase is the interior remodeling of the kitchen, food court, the first and third floors in the same areas of the building. The third phase will be an addition to the north and remodeling of the first floor in the area of the original bookstore. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Visual Aide #1:</em> </strong>The Manwaring Center will be the work horse of the campus. This is a representation of the <strong>first floor</strong> when construction is completed in 2010. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/Nielsen/001.jpg" border="1" alt="Manwaring Center floor plan" width="398" height="221" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The light blue area represents the University Store as it now stands. The sales floor space has increased. The internal traffic flow for students and access to the selection of items are great improvements. When complete the main entrances will be inside the corridor in the Phase 3 addition across from the Activities area and north to the Smith Building. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The white area represents Phase 2 which is under construction now. It will be home to the I-Card offices, unassigned offices, unassigned meeting/classrooms, and one of the programs from the activities group. The unassigned spaces will be available for campus use through the scheduling office. Each room will be equipped with tables and chairs that can be arranged to meet the needs of a specific event. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The pink areas represent a student service area of the building with a C-Store, JoLynn&#39;s, Freshen&#39;s, and a bank. The C-Store will contain the items that were a part of Tomasito&#39;s . JoLynn&#39;s and Freshen&#39;s will continue with the original offerings in an expanded space. The bank space will be leased to a financial institution and operated independently of the university. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The green area represents the new home for the activities space There will be storefront windows in the halls to invite the students in to see what is going on and to volunteer. The final design will accommodate the Activities Program as it expands and contracts and changes to meet the needs of the students. The plan and furniture will be flexible to meet the needs of the program 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The light yellow includes unassigned meeting/classrooms, a student gathering space, and practice rooms for interviews, string instruments, and quiet study. These spaces will be managed through the scheduling office. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Visual Aide #2: </strong></em>This is the plan for the <strong>second floor</strong>. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Phase two is underway. When complete it will house a new food court and a gathering space for students highlighted in turquoise. We are excited about the space. There will be a small stage to the north where performances may occur. The entire space will have wireless connection to the internet. Electrical outlets are around the perimeters for laptop use. There will be seating for 1,000 students with furniture ranging from lounge to group study to traditional dining to caf&eacute; dining. The ceiling height will range from 10&#39; to 27&#39; and the views through the windows will allow you to stand in the middle of the room and look north to the mountains and south to the Taylor Building.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The West Ballrooms, represented in white, will be unchanged. The area in purple is the office and classroom suite for the Dance Program. Specific areas include: two dance studios, costume shop with storage, and offices.&nbsp; The area in yellow represents the existing Event Management Office Suite.&nbsp; Orange is used to show the kitchen and food service support areas.

Specific rooms on this floor include the new Special Events Room in blue, one new conference room in blue, and a larger circulation area around these rooms. Much of this floor will remain the same with modest face lifts. The Special Events Room will replace the room that is currently on the first floor.

The Auditorium would be comparable to the Arabian horse. Its&#39; rugged durability is concealed with an air of grace and stature. The following plans will give you an idea of the scope of the building.

In this plan we see that the seating is arrayed in a fan which allows the largest number of people to be close to the platform where the speaker stands. It also provides a direct view of the speaker without turning the head. There will also be support rooms including the Green Room for guests and a dressing room. The chairs will be padded theater style without cup holders. The platform will not be set up as a performance stage as we have in the Snow Theater. Uses for the auditorium will be spiritual in nature, i.e. Devotionals, Graduation, Inaugurations, CES Firesides, and potentially Tabernacle Choir performances. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The court space will be striped for basketball and volley ball. Other sports can be played in the space. The arrows show the entries to the building at this level.

<p>20,000 cubic yards of concrete has been placed<br />
							7,000 tons of steel have been ordered and erected </p>
<p>75,000 cubic yards of rock were removed

<p>4 acres of roofing 
	</p>
<p>7,000 light fixtures

	</p>
<p>5,000,000 cubic feet of volume 
	</p>
<p>1400 pre-cast panels&nbsp; 
							</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These projects show the dedication the Leaders of the church as representatives of the Lord have to the university and education of the youth of the church. I can remember the first day when revelation started on these projects. I was sitting in this room, the Hart Auditorium, on the west side about the centerline of the basketball courts. The announcements electrified the room and the spirit witnessed the source and devine nature of the changes. After a pause I knew that the revelation was from Heaven through a prophet of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The campus has changed greatly since the announcement and these projects have changed greatly since their inception 8 years ago. The size and complexity of the buildings design have changed as the needs of the students on the track system, the number of married students, and longer class periods have become clear. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As the campus grew, the Administration reviewed the needs of the students. The strengths and the weaknesses of the facilities were and are evaluated. An outcome of the evaluations prompted many questions, where do the students gather? Where do they gather for devotional? When the President of the church comes, how many can sit in the Hart? What happens at graduation for the students who cannot obtain tickets for their friends and family who want to attend? A similar analysis was conducted on the Manwaring Center for the services provided by the University Store and the Food Services. The conclusion was that we needed gathering spaces for the students. The conclusion became the goal for the buildings; provide gathering places for the students. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The two buildings will provide different gathering functions for the students. The Manwaring will provide social interaction. The Food Court will provide an informal gathering area for the students. It will be a location where people can sit with a light lunch or gather as a study group to start the big class project that is due tomorrow. The possibilities will be great and the benefits even greater to the students. We hope and pray that the Food Court will be noisy and crowded with students. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Auditorium will provide a place where the student body can gather en masse to be taught by the leaders of the church, the university and the community. It will be a place where the entire family of the graduates can gather to celebrate. It will be a place where all can gather to witness an inauguration, convocation, devotional, and firesides. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord is invited to every event. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Gathering has been a part of the gospel from the beginning. It is gathering that provides strength and blessings to a congregation of saints. Gathering and the reasons for gathering are documented in the scriptures and by the teachings of prophets: 
</p>
<p>
	Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman and there bestowed upon them his last blessing. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the last generation. (D&amp;C 107:53, 56) 
	</p>
<p>
Mosiah Chapter 2 records King Benjamin&#39;s desire to address his people: 
</p>
<p>
	And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which King Benjamin should speak unto them. (Mosiah 2:1) 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When they assembled at the temple they were taught by King Benjamin. In chapters 2 through chapter 6, King Benjamin teaches wonderful and marvelous principles and revelations. The teachings include the atonement of Jesus Christ, the suffering of the wicked, how to repent and obtain forgiveness, exhortation to be steadfast and taking upon us the name of Christ. Finally he records the names of the people. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Section 37: 3 
</p>
<p>
	And again, a commandment I give unto the Church, that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio... 
	</p>
<p>
In this revelation the Saints are directed to gather to a central place, Ohio. Later, the saints were gathered to Missouri, Illinois, and finally Utah. This allowed the saints to be with the prophet and other leaders of the church and to be taught and strengthened. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Section 110:11 reads: 
</p>
<p>
	After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us: and Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys for the gathering of Israel from the four corners of the earth<em>...</em>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Joseph Smith taught, &quot;The main object of gathering was to build unto the Lord a house whereby he could reveal unto his people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and teach the people the way to salvation; for there are certain ordinances and principles that, when they are taught and practiced, must be done in a place or house built for that purpose.&quot; (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, Compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, Copyright 1938, page 308) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Rexburg Temple is a result of the gathering that has resulted from the changes at the university. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The dream of the university is that the Manwaring Center will be a center of hustle and bustle. Gathering in the MC will encourage social interaction. There are students here who were the only members of the church in their school, their families the only members in the town. There are students here who have been shunned by family, friends and relatives as a result of joining the church. There are students here that believe that they are the only ones in the entire university who do not come from the &quot;perfect&quot; home. There are students here today who would melt with joy if their value as a child of God was confirmed by another child of God. As we gather, we find others who share and our heartaches and believed failings. We can find those who have overcome and can teach the way to success. So we gather to know that we have common beliefs with many people with a variety of backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Gathering at the Auditorium will allow the strength of the spirit to fill our hearts and souls. Students will sit at the feet of prophets and apostles to be taught of their worth; to be given hope, strength and knowledge; and a holy witness of the truth of the gospel. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As members of the House of Israel, we have gathered to Zion where the pure in heart dwell and where the gospel in its fullness is available to all. This gathering is designed to give us a sense of belonging to something bigger than we have ever known. We can stand or sit or walk beside others who embrace the same covenants that we do. We also reach out to gather in others of the House of Israel. In our congregation, we can lean on others when we are weak. We can sustain others when they are faltering as we have been sustained. In a place where saints have gathered we can find the power of the gospel is a spiritual presence. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I want to share some highlights about the review and approval of the Auditorium. Shortly after the announcement in 2000, we planned all of the construction projects that would be required based on the academic curriculum provided. The Manwaring and the Auditorium were scheduled to be the last of the construction projects. Time progressed and the original assumptions did not meet the changing realities of the students needs. A request was submitted to the Board of Trustees to amend the building program. Approval was given to amend the building plans to reflect the needs of the students. The amended plans were submitted to the Executive Board (First Presidency, members of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, and other leaders) for consideration. Three options were prepared: 8,000, 10,000 and 12,000 seats. The concept was presented on a Tuesday and the 12,000 seat plan was approved. On Friday, President Hinckley called President Clark and told him that he had been thinking about the project. Direction was given that the project should be larger and built faster. The outcome is an amazing structure that will allow the entire student body to assemble in one space and be taught by the President of the Church, Apostles, members of the Quorums of Seventy, other leaders, or campus faculty and staff. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When we gather in a group of true believers, in humility, with real intent, we can be taught marvelous gospel principles, usually not by the speakers. You will feel the power of the Holy Ghost as we gather in one location to be taught at the feet of the prophet along with 15,000 others. These occasions will provide a great spiritual lift and strengthening to our souls. There is one other small blessing; you won&#39;t have to cut class to get a good seat.&nbsp;There are 27 front rows but there are three levels of back row seating totaling 768 seats. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There will be holy moments when we can sit in the Manwaring Center or the Auditorium for the dedications. It will be a holy moment when the choirs, well rehearsed, have their natural talents boosted by the blessing of Heaven and raise our spirits to the Heavens. Each testimony will be uttered in a holy moment. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Section 29, Jesus Christ teaches that He will gather his elect: 
</p>
<p>
	Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I Am, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins; <br />
<br />
	Who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer. (D&amp;C 29:1-2) 
	</p>
<p>
As children of Israel and children of our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ has invited, asked and begged us to come to Him. As he beckons us to come He offers us earthly happiness, salvation and eternal joy. He has promised us his spirit when we desire it enough to repent. Jesus, the greatest of all is greatly concerned about us as individuals. President Monson, as president of the church, is greatly concerned about us as individuals. President Clark, Stake Presidents, Bishops, and home or visiting teachers are greatly concerned about us as individuals. The building will provide blessings to individuals through the presence of others. The growth of the campus exists not for the earthly attainments of the leaders but rather out of great concern for the youth of the church. The children of Israel gather to share and grow and support and sustain with each other in the church of Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I believe that there are some students at the university that have a great need to know that they are wanted, needed and accepted. Gathering here at the university, living the Honor Code, magnifying our callings, and caring for our fellow students will help us gain confidence in the Lord and Heavenly Father and that we can be blessed in our efforts. Our natural talents will be magnified not for our benefit but for the blessing of others. Gathering gves us an eternal understanding of earthly matters. We will be participants in gathering the children of Israel in from the four corners of the world. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The buildings are part of Heaven&#39;s design for the campus to bless the students. Heavenly Father lives and is aware of our trials and tribulations. Jesus is the Christ. The Book of Mormon is true and the church of Jesus Christ has been restored.

It is a great privilege to be with you today. I have served as an Institute director for many years and I love to be with you good university students. And I would like especially to show my gratitude for the spirit that you bring to this campus.&nbsp; I always feel a strong spirit here with you.&nbsp; Thank you so much. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I would like to start by sharing with you part of the life history of my father and his family. My father was born in 1922. His family consisted of his father, his mother and five boys. He was the next to the youngest of the boys. When my grandmother, my father&#39;s mother, was just 23 years old, it became necessary for her to raise her four boys alone. One of the boys had passed away when he was 10 months old. My grandmother did a very good job raising her four boys; in fact, my three uncles were very kind and very nice to me. I remember so many sweet experiences that we had. They were honest and hard workers and they taught me good things. But they committed some mistakes. Let me share with you one mistake that all three of them committed. They each made the decision to not get married. They decided to not marry. My father was the only one who chose to get married. He chose to keep the law of chastity even though he was not a Church member, and to find a good lady to marry. He married my mom-a good and worthy lady. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What would have happened if my father had followed the example of his brothers in their decision to not marry? One consequence surely would have been that the name Mendes Costa, our family name, would not have continued. But because he chose to marry my mom and have children, they have two boys and two girls, our family name continues. And because my brother and I made the same decision as my father, our sons continue to carry the Mendes Costa name. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Another choice of my father was to receive the missionaries and be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a consequence of his choice, all of his children and his children&#39;s children became Church members, and the following generations have been born in the covenant. In fact, he gave a good example in the year 2000 when he passed away, faithful and crossed the veil at a Sunday church meeting. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Now a question for you: What could have happened if Nephi chose to not go into the desert because his father had a dream? What could have happened? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s think for a moment about some parts of the life of Nephi. I will do it in a different way. I will transfer Nephi&#39;s time for our time. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose that tomorrow at five o&#39;clock in the morning, your father wakes you up and says to you: &quot;Son/Daughter, I have had a dream and in my dream, the Lord instructed us to leave our home and go to the desert. We will leave our good home, our comfortable home, our car, the air conditioning, refrigerator, microwave; there will be no Costco or Wal-Mart in the desert. We will go to the desert without any knowledge about what will happen. He has instructed us to leave and all we will take is a tent and our family.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You are smart young people. You understand what the desert means, and particularly the desert Nephi entered. It was hot during the day and cold during the night. Remember, there was no heat, air conditioning, bathtub, or shower. &nbsp;Absolutely, just sand. Do you remember the last time you were at the beach? What was the first thing you did when you returned home, or to the motel? You took a shower because you had sand all over your body and it was uncomfortable. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s go back to the desert and Nephi. He had sand on the outside of his body and the inside.&nbsp; It took a lot of faith, but he chose to say,  
</p>
<p>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. (1 Nephi 3:7)
							</p>
<p>
What would be your answer to your father? Would your answer be the same as Nephi&#39;s answer? Or, would you say, &quot;Daddy, it is five o&#39;clock in the morning! Let me sleep. You are a dreamer. It was just a dream.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have faith that you are like Nephi and I believe your decision would be the same decision as Nephi chose to do-to follow his father to the desert just because his father had a dream. Nothing more than a dream. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s continue in the desert with Nephi and the next part of his journey. They walked for three days in the desert, and after three days they found a nice oasis. Now you are there, and after three days of walking you find a small lake with clear and fresh water. You have a waterfall so you can shower. You have fish for a meal, you can pick fresh fruit from the tree, there are animals to hunt and prepare for a barbecue, and soft grass on which to place your tent and sleep. What a wonderful night. You sleep well. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At five o&#39;clock the next morning, your daddy wakes you up and says to you, &quot;Son/Daughter, I have had a dream. In this dream the Lord commanded that I would stay here in this marvelous oasis, and you will go three days back to the city. There is a man named Laban. He has 50 soldiers ready to kill anyone who tries to take anything, but don&#39;t worry because in my dream you will be safe. You go and I will stay here waiting for you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What would be your answer? Nephi said, &quot;I will go and [I will] do.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What would be your answer?&nbsp; &quot;Daddy, you are a dreamer. Why don&#39;t you dream that you should go with us?&quot; Or, &quot;Father, we don&#39;t need the plates. They are not essential in the desert!&quot; Perhaps you would answer like that. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
But I believe, really believe, that you are like Nephi and you tell your father you will travel for three days back to the city and you will talk to Laban, and you will come back with the plates. Full of faith in your heart. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
So you arrive in the city and you do everything that Nephi did, including cutting off the head of Laban, and you travel for three days to the tent of your father. When you are back, there is a great party with barbecue, fruits, a shower and all you want. You sleep over the grass again. 
</p>
<p>
The next morning at five o&#39;clock your daddy wakes you up again and says, &quot;Son, I had another dream. It was for you. I will stay here in this oasis, and you will walk for three days back to the city. There is a man named Ishmael. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Can you imagine being like Nephi and saying, &quot;I will go and [I will] do the things which the Lord hath commanded.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You arrive at the house of Ishmael and you knock on his door. And you say, &quot;Ishmael, I am the son of Lehi.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Can you imagine him saying, &quot;I heard about your family! Your father had a dream and you did the most crazy thing. You left for the desert.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
You say to Ishmael, &quot;Yes, we are the family you heard about, and my father has had a dream for you. You are to leave your home and all your possessions and join us in the desert, and don&#39;t forget to bring your daughters with you because they will marry us.&quot;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Can you imagine better how hard it was for Nephi to follow his father and do what the Lord asked them to do? But Nephi made the right decision. He was moved by the Spirit, and because he made the right choice he declared that he was &quot;favored of the Lord in all my days&quot; (1 Nephi 1:1). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How blessed he was! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Think for just a moment what would have happened if our beloved pioneers had not made the decision to follow the prophets, and chose not to suffer the challenges along the way, and did not come to this beautiful place? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What could have happened if Joseph Smith, after reading and pondering James 1:5, thought to himself, &quot;My parents have a religion. I can follow their religion.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What would have happened if our youth-19 to 26 years old of age-did not make the decision to serve missions?&nbsp; Would the Church have 13 million members? Would the Lord have 13 million of His children who have repented and chosen to be baptized? Could the millions and millions of dead people have received their temple ordinances?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Can you imagine if our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ had not made the decision to follow the plan of salvation given by a loving Father in Heaven? Can you imagine if He had not made the decision to give His life for us, to suffer for our physical and spiritual pains and sins? What might have happened? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Now think for a moment. You are in a period of your life when you are making a lot of decisions: You need to decide your career, many of you will decide whether or not to serve a mission, to marry or not to marry, to follow or not to follow the prophets, to know or not to know that the scriptures are the word of God, to keep or not to keep the laws and commandments of God, to attend or to not attend church, to participate or not to &nbsp;participate in church activities, to choose friends who will or friends who will not help you stay on the path of righteousness, to serve or to not serve in the Church, and many other decisions. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You need to make decisions every day and I hope that you are making your decisions after a conversation with the Lord, after prayer and meditation, finding in the scriptures what happened with people in the same situation that you are in before you make your decision. We are living in different times.&nbsp; Do you remember President Hinckley many times said that we are living in the most challenging of times, but times with more opportunities. It is true. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When I was in your age, there was not a single university in my city. It was different. Now, you can come to a university like BYU.&nbsp; The best in the whole world. And you can associate with so many good people.&nbsp; You have the privilege of being taught by professors who understand the code of honor, who understand the laws of God, and who are very good examples for you.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You are able to come for your Sunday meetings and for church activities on this campus. You have so many opportunities and you also have many challenges. Every day you need to choose to do or not to do many things. Every day you need to choose what to watch on TV.&nbsp; Every day you have an opportunity to choose if you will visit an inappropriate site on the Internet or not. And obviously, you are listening to a lot of news in our days.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

Many of you are very close to finishing college and will go to work. You may hear that there will be no employment, no future, but don&#39;t believe any of it. The Lord promised in the Book of Mormon many times that if you choose to keep the commandments, you will be prosperous in the land.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t say in the celestial kingdom, He said in the land. That means here, on the earth. I am sure that you will be blessed if you continue to keep the commandments of God; if you continue to make the right choices; if you continue to give your best. I know that the Lord will bless you. 
</p>

Every morning I read the news in Portuguese and Spanish. In the afternoon, I read the news in English.&nbsp; It is interesting how many people are pessimists. Do you know the difference between a pessimist and an optimist? The optimist is the person who can always see a light at the end of the tunnel. The pessimist is the person who turns off the light.&nbsp; We need more people with the capacity to look to the future with great enthusiasm. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The future is bright.&nbsp; It is beautiful.&nbsp; I know that because I am in front of the future.&nbsp; You are the great promise that our future is wonderful. You are trying to follow the counsel of the living prophets, you are trying to do your best, you are trying to make good choices every day.&nbsp; You will make the decision that my father made and that I made, to marry.&nbsp; I have faith that will happen with each of you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It is wonderful to live in these days when we can communicate with absolutely any part of the world. My young grandchildren are in Brazil.&nbsp; We talk to them using the computer. They call my wife the &quot;virtual&quot; mom. When we have finished the conversation, they hug the computer and kiss the monitor just to say good bye.&nbsp; They believe grandma and grandpa are very small and that we live in the computer.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
And you have so much opportunity.&nbsp; When I was your age, no computers! I remember the first computer that came to the company that I was working for. It was in a big room with a lot of machines there and perhaps we got a half gigabyte. Now I can take my telephone and use it any place in the world.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
My counsel to you today is that before you make decisions, take time and think about the consequences of your decisions, because these decisions will build your future. Sometimes you will need to go to the temple and sit there quietly and ask the Lord for confirmation of your decisions. &nbsp;When you receive His direction, go ahead and do what the Lord approved you to do. Your decisions will open or close doors for you, and will make you happy or unhappy. Your decisions will conduct you either to the celestial kingdom, or to another kingdom that is not desirable for you and for me. 
</p>

On Saturday evening, August 23, prior to a cultural program held in conjunction with the Twin Falls Idaho Temple dedication, President Monson spoke to the youth and said, &quot;There isn&#39;t a simple decision in life. Everything is important. Every decision you make. So make your decisions with a prayerful heart.&quot; Then he gave them a little saying to help them remember: &quot;Decisions Determine Destiny.&quot; He said he calls it the &quot;Three D&#39;s&quot; (New Temple is Dedicated in Idaho,&quot; <em>Church News,</em> August 30, 2008, 3). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Before I made the decision to marry my wife, I asked her a question and the question was this: Will you follow the prophets of God? Both of us are converts of the Church. After she gave me her answer, which was Yes! I was sure that she was the perfect person to become my eternal companion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We made the decision to follow the prophets of God. If they ask us to do things we like or we don&#39;t like, if they ask us to do things that are easy for us or hard for us to do, it doesn&#39;t matter. We chose one time to follow the prophets our whole life and because of that choice, we are 100 percent happy. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We have a motto in our family. The Costa Motto is:  
</p>
<p>&quot;To be happy is to keep the commandments of God and to follow the prophet and, like Joshua, &lsquo;As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&#39;&quot; (Joshua 24:15)
							</p>
<p>
I have a great love for the youth of the Church. You are the future of the Church.&nbsp; You are the future of the nations. You are the future of the world. And I believe that each of you is like Nephi. You will be ready to say to the Lord, &quot;I will do, Lord, I will do.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You are great examples for me. I love you. I love my Savior, my Redeemer. I know that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; To know that the Church is the true Church of Jesus Christ took me 14 hours of praying and talking with the Lord. He gave me a complete knowledge that Joseph Smith is a prophet. I know, perfectly, what happened that beautiful morning of 1820 in the sacred grove and I testify to you that Joseph is a prophet of God.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is a sacred scripture; and you can guide your life by the teachings of this precious and perfect book of scriptures. I know that Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God.&nbsp; I love President Monson.&nbsp; He is a great prophet.&nbsp; President Monson is a prophet for our days.&nbsp; I know that Jesus is the Christ; He is our Savior, our Redeemer. I know that He suffered all the pains of the spiritual death and the physical death for each of us. He loves us.&nbsp; He loves you. I invoke His blessings upon you-perhaps not the blessings that you are asking for, but the blessings that you need. We love you.&nbsp; Make right and wise decisions in life and I promise you that you will be 100 percent happy.&nbsp; The Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

As each one of us is born, we begin our own personal voyage as a ship on the sea of life, a voyage that bears the promise of returning us to live with our Father in Heaven. Our ships are steered by a helm or wheel. In the beginning, our parents and loved ones are at the helm of our ship, steering and directing. As we age and mature, our parents gradually let us take the helm as we learn to steer and direct our own lives. Eventually, each of us becomes solely responsible for directing our own ship. We cannot turn the helm over to another, for it is required that we steer our own vessel. Our decisions and actions in life determine which direction our personal ship will sail-towards eternal life with our Father in Heaven or in some other direction. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Several years ago, one of my students gave me a wallet-size copy of a painting by Warner Sallman, titled &quot;Christ Our Pilot.&quot; It is displayed on the wall of my office as a regular reminder that I am at the helm of my personal ship. However, as depicted in the painting, I am not alone. Christ stands behind me as my pilot for my life&#39;s voyage, ready to point and direct as I learn to trust Him and allow Him into my life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We know that our life&#39;s voyage will not always be smooth sailing. There will be winds and storms that will buffet us and toss us to and fro upon life&#39;s sea. But there is help. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Trust in the Lord</em> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
	...whoso putteth his <em>trust in the Lord</em> shall be safe. (Proverbs 29:25, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
If we are to safely navigate back to our Heavenly Father, we must learn to trust in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our personal life experiences give us opportunities to develop and nurture such faith and trust. We may not have to endure the trials that Job experienced, but each of us will experience trials. Job had learned to develop trust in the Lord. In spite of his afflictions, he declared, 
</p>
<p>
	Though he slay me, yet will I <em>trust in him</em>....<strong> </strong>(Job 13:15, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
Job further said, 
</p>
<p>
	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. (Job 23:8-10) 
	</p>
<p>
Job understood that as he steered his ship, the Savior was behind him acting as his pilot. He could not feel him or see him, but he had developed trust that the Lord was there to direct and help him through his trials. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I look back on my own life, I can identify several events that have increased my trust in Jesus Christ. With such trust I gain confidence and can better steer my ship as I listen to and obey the Savior&#39;s counsel. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I was one year old, I developed a lump on the back of my head about the size of an egg. My siblings say that it was caused by me rolling off the couch too many times and hitting my head. I was taken to the doctor to have it checked. Eventually, it was determined to be a malignant tumor. It was removed through surgery, and I had follow up radiation treatments. Because I was only one year old, I have no recollection of the surgery or the radiation treatments. However, as a young boy, I do remember my mother often reminding me to be careful while playing so that I would not bump my head. She would remind me that I had gone through surgery to remove the cancer and that because of priesthood blessings, the faith of my family, and the tender mercies of the Lord, I had survived. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I was six years old, I remember going to see the cancer doctor prior to my starting school. After an examination, he declared that I was cancer free and that I could live a normal life and that my mother had nothing further to worry about. That was great news to me. During the ensuing years, I enjoyed an active life, playing in neighborhood football and little league baseball games. I participated in numerous sports in high school-football, basketball, baseball, and track, with football being my favorite, where I took many a blow to the head. Even today I stay active by playing in that high contact sport called church basketball. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
From this cancer event, I concluded at an early age that I must have been blessed to have survived the cancer and that I could learn to do as my family had done, to trust in the goodness of the Savior. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In June, between my freshman and sophomore years of high school, my oldest brother took some of the younger brothers for a few days hiking and camping in the mountains of Central Idaho. This was a welcome respite from the daily chores of life on a dairy farm to which I had become accustomed. We had a great time. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One afternoon, about ten days after returning from our trip, as I was out in the barn performing a deep clean of the milking system, I began to feel quite sick. After finishing the chore, I went to the house and reported to my mother that I had a pounding headache. She told me to go lay down, which I gladly did. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That evening my headache and I attended mutual together. After mutual I went to softball practice for our young men&#39;s church team. At the time, our stake played fast pitch softball and while I was taking my turn at batting practice, I was struck in the head with a high and inside pitch. It knocked me to the ground and I was done for the night. I got home and immediately went to bed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The next day, I felt even worse. My parents and I didn&#39;t know if I hurt because I was actually sick or because I had been hit in the head with the softball. On the second day I felt worse yet and could not keep any food down. My head was still pounding, I had a high fever, every muscle in my body seemed to ache, and I nearly passed out every time I tried to stand. A rash began to appear on parts of my body. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My father gave me a priesthood blessing and my mother took me to the doctor. After nearly passing out in the doctor&#39;s office, the doctor decided to admit me to the hospital so that I could receive an IV in order to avoid becoming dehydrated. Once there, all sorts of tests were administered, but the doctor couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with me. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
After being in the hospital two days and the doctors yet to determine my ailment, I remember pleading with Heavenly Father to direct the doctors to know what to do. That night my mother was at home fast asleep when she was suddenly awakened. She sat straight up in bed as she distinctly heard the words, &quot;Keith has Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.&quot; She immediately jumped out of bed and consulted her medical books. All of the symptoms described were an exact match of what I had been experiencing and she read that it could be fatal. She immediately called the doctor and told him what my illness was. The doctor consulted his medical books, agreed with my mother, and I was treated for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Even though we had diligently checked for ticks, apparently one found me to be of its liking, burrowed in, and went undetected in our daily examinations. I slowly gained my strength back throughout the rest of the summer and was able to play football that fall. This experience helped me realize that I was developing a greater trust in Jesus Christ and that He personally cared about me. In looking back, I also realize that through my prayers and pleading with Heavenly Father, I was learning to take over the helm of my own ship from my parents. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A few years later, as I entered the Missionary Training Center to begin my mission to Japan, I quickly concluded that I was now fully at the helm of my ship. My parents could no longer help me steer it. Now I really needed to trust in the Lord in order for me to learn the language and to live in a new and strange culture. I learned that through faith and obedience, I could be a successful missionary and my trust in the Lord increased greatly during my two years of service. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Ten days after my fourth daughter, Carolyn, was born, as I was lifting her out of her bassinet that morning, I noticed that she seemed intensely warm and unresponsive. The doctor was called and he gave instructions to bring her in just as soon as possible. On the way to the doctor, I stopped at the college where I worked and located a fellow member of the church who helped me give her a priesthood blessing. When the doctor saw her 104 degree temperature, he arranged for her to be immediately admitted to the hospital. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
After probing her little body for what seemed like hours to find a vein into which they could insert an IV, a couple of spinal taps where a long needle was inserted into the spine to draw fluid, and an endless array of tests, it was concluded that she had contracted spinal meningitis. Meningitis is a medical condition that is caused by inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is potentially life threatening due to the inflammation&#39;s proximity to the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can also lead to serious long-term consequences such as deafness, epilepsy, brain damage, or loss of vision, especially if not treated quickly. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For four days, as she lay in the hospital in an unresponsive state, I prayed and prayed that my little girl would live so that I could raise her. On the night of that fourth day, I concluded that I had been praying selfishly. I realized that I had been counseling the Lord regarding my daughter rather than seeking His counsel. Instead of asking for what I wanted, I needed to trust the Lord and accept what He had in store. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the Book of Mormon, Jacob teaches us,<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works. (Jacob 4:10.) 
	</p>
<p>
My prayer that night took a different form. I thanked Heavenly Father for the opportunity to have this little baby girl in my life, even if it had been for only a short few days. I told Him that I understood that she had received her mortal body and that if His plan was to have her return to Him, then I would miss her but I would accept it. As I prayed, a deep feeling of peace came over me. I knew that regardless of what would happen to this little baby, it was God&#39;s will and I trusted in that. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The next day, she began to show a slight improvement. The antibiotics she was given appeared to be working. Each of the following days brought further improvements and on Halloween, after ten days in the hospital, my little girl was able to come home. She has grown up healthy and beautiful and has provided us with our most recent grandchild. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now this experience not only increased my trust in the Lord, it also provided me with an opportunity to help my daughter learn to trust the Lord. She obviously would not be able to remember the event, buy like my mother did for me, I could remind her often during her growing up years of how her life was spared because of the mercies of the Lord, thus helping her to develop a trust in Him that could serve her well as she learned to take over the helm of her own ship. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When my second daughter, Janelle, was seven years old, we were building a new home. The kids would often play in the piles of dirt around the yard. One day as I was working on the house, she came to me and indicated she had lost her little CTR ring that the Primary gives out, the kind that you squeeze together to make them fit and that cause a greenish color on your finger when you wear them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I helped her look around the yard for it, but we couldn&#39;t find it. The thought came to my mind that we could pray to find it, but I thought to myself that Heavenly Father probably wasn&#39;t too worried about that cheap little CTR ring. However, I decided that I would say a silent prayer and not involve my daughter. That way if we didn&#39;t find it, she wouldn&#39;t be disappointed in God. So I quickly said my little prayer, not expecting to ever find it. As I walked around the corner of the house where we had previously searched, suddenly there was the ring lying on the ground in plain sight. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I learned, &quot;It is better to<em> trust in the Lord</em> than to put confidence in man&quot; (Psalms 118:98, emphais added).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Tears filled my eyes as I reached down to pick up the ring. Why had I not been more trusting of the Lord? I quickly picked it up and handed it to my daughter, explaining to her that I had said a little prayer and that it had been answered because we had been able to find the ring. Apparently the Lord did care about my little girl and her cheap CTR ring and my faith and trust in Him grew that day as I am sure my daughter&#39;s did. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Just over thirteen years ago, my wife at the time, through a series of choices that led her to question her testimony, ultimately decided to leave our marriage and our family and to move out of state. She said that I could have the house and our six children. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I found myself a divorced, single father trying to balance employment, my calling in the bishopric, fatherhood, and an attempt at being &quot;mister mom.&quot; My four daughters were 15, 10, 9, and 7 years old at the time, and my two sons were 12 and 5. Boy did I ever need help. I prayed several times a day pleading with the Lord for guidance and direction. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A short time later, a good sister in my ward mailed a note to me which had a profound effect. It said that I should remember, &quot;This is not life, but only an event in life. Pain and suffering are required; misery is optional.&quot; I realized that I could not change the situation, but I could control how I reacted. I concluded that I would have to exercise as much faith as I could and place my trust in the Lord to get through this ordeal, recognizing Christ as my rock and my foundation. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Helaman taught his sons the importance of having Christ as their foundation.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. (Helaman 5:12) 
	</p>
<p>
Mosiah<strong> </strong>gives us further insight.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your <em>trust in him</em>, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will...deliver you.... (Mosiah 7:33, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
Alma taught this principle of trusting in the Lord to his son. 
</p>
<p>
	And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their <em>trust in God</em> shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day. (Alma 36:3, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
Is it any wonder that Joseph Smith was told that his trials would be good for him? For it was through his trials that he learned more fully to place his trust in the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Here are the Lord&#39;s words to him. 
</p>
<p>
	And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. (D&amp;C 122:7) 
	</p>
<p>
It is through trials that we learn to put our trust in the Lord. It requires that we humble ourselves and turn to Him as our rock and as our foundation. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mosiah adds: 
</p>
<p>
	But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their <em>trust in him</em>. (Mosiah 29:20, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
During my trial of being a single dad, I learned to do a lot of new things. I learned to cut my children&#39;s hair. I learned to use a curling iron on my girls&#39; hair. I learned to take my daughters on those special shopping trips as they matured. My children survived my cooking and my girls&#39; sometimes endured bangs that I often cut too short, but we learned to work together as a team. We placed our trust in the Lord and faithfully continued having daily family prayer and family scripture study, and weekly family home evenings. Through faith, obedience, and an increased trust in the Lord, my children and I were sustained through this difficult period. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A little over a year after the divorce, my parents were visiting and on the morning they were preparing to leave, I asked my dad for a father&#39;s blessing. I was promised that if I trusted in the Lord, I would find a new companion. With fear and trepidation, I jumped into the dating game. In a few months I met a wonderful woman. I could quickly tell that she loved the Lord. After a five-month courtship, we were married and together we began the process of blending our two families. I gained a beautiful new daughter and two more handsome sons. My wife and I have been blessed in this effort to blend our families. It has not always been easy, but as she and I work together in a three-way relationship with Jesus Christ and place our trust in Him, we are confident that we will succeed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I have one more experience that I would like to share, one that happened here at BYU-Idaho. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At the dedication of the Hinckley Building at BYU-Idaho on October, 22, 2002, which I attended, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:
</p>
<p>
	The announcement that came in the year 2000 [that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho] was bold and, I believe, <em>prophetic</em>.&quot;&nbsp;(emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
That day, President Hinckley talked to the community, to the faculty, and to the students. To the community he said:
</p>
<p>
	To the people of Rexburg, I believe you will benefit from this change and I hope that all will unite to assist in this process, realizing that in the presence of this university in this city, you have an immense treasure and an institution worthy of your support in all it undertakes to do.
	</p>
<p>
I believe the community has benefited in several ways since the transition from Ricks College to BYU-Idaho, one of which must include the beautiful Rexburg Temple that sits on the hill nearby. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To the faculty he said:
</p>
<p>
	To this good faculty who are here, I would like to say a word to you. Help these young people. I know you do. But reach a little lower to lift them a little higher. Be kind and generous and helpful and patient and encouraging. Do all that you can to stand before them as examples, teaching them the things, the disciplines that you are called upon to teach. But while doing so, stand before them as examples of faith and faithfulness and rectitude and goodness, I humbly pray.
	</p>
<p>
And finally, here are several quotes of things that he said to the students:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	First I want to tell you that I love you. I love you kids, you wonderful young people of this Church.... 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Now don&#39;t ever do a cheap or a tawdry or a mean or an evil thing, my dear young friends. You don&#39;t have to engage in these things. The world is on a slippery slide, it is going downhill and it is going fast. And you are as a beacon on a hill.... 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	You don&#39;t have to be a genius. You don&#39;t have to be a straight-A student. You just have to do your very best.... And somehow, if you do that, God will open the way before you and the sun will shine, and your lives will be fruitful and you will accomplish great good in the world in which you take a part. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	There is no end in sight for the good you can do. Do you know it? You are just simple kids. You are not geniuses. I know that. But the work of the world isn&#39;t done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people who have learned to work in an extraordinary way.... 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	I repeat. Don&#39;t sell yourselves short. You look in the mirror every morning when you boys get up to scrape off the fuzz, and the girls get up to put on the paint, you look in the mirror and say, &quot;I can do the right thing today, God being my helper. And I will do it.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	I see a great future for this institution.... It will be increasingly recognized as its graduates move out across the world and fill positions of responsibility.

A year before the Hinckley Building dedication, in a September 18, 2001 devotional address at BYU-Idaho titled &quot;A Steady, Upward Course&quot;, which I was privileged to attend, President Henry B. Eyring, then a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, said, 
</p>
<p>
	Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become-<em>and this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly</em>-those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve. (emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
He continued, 
</p>
<p>
	... I&#39;ll make you a <em>prophecy</em>. I will simply tell you: The day will come that that capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you&#39;re in. They will not quite know why, but you will know that the reason you are being singled out is not because of your innate gifts as a leader but because you have done what the Savior would do-learned how to, and did, reach out to those around you to try to lift them, to help them to be better even when it might be a little bit difficult and you might not have been received very well. (emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
Near the end of his address, he said:
</p>
<p>
	I hope I live long enough to someday meet some employer who employed one of you and says, &lsquo;Where did that come from? I&#39;ve never had such a person. Why people just flock around that person. And they want to follow. They don&#39;t have to be led; they&#39;re seeking to go where that person wants to go. And they come up with new ideas. I don&#39;t know where that comes from. They seem to find a better way, and the budget doesn&#39;t go up. I can&#39;t understand it. And I&#39;ll smile and say, &quot;Well, you come with me to Rexburg. And I may not be able to show it to you, and I may not be able to prove it to you, but you&#39;ll feel it.&quot;There will be a spirit here, I so testify, because of the love of God for all of His faithful children. And those blessings will be poured out here in rich abundance.

As BYU-Idaho became a university, I must admit that I was quite skeptical about competing with other universities with much more prestige and recognized names, for employment and internship opportunities, especially in the accounting area. Many of our accounting students struggled to find good internships in the early semesters of our transition. Some even had to accept non-paid opportunities just to land an internship. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Then late in the fall semester of 2004, December to be exact, one of our international accounting students was looking around on the internet for internship opportunities for the winter semester of 2005, which was less than a month away, when he discovered that one of the Big 4 CPA firms in New York City was looking for help. He contacted them and they conducted a phone interview with him. They offered him an internship position over the phone and wanted to know if there were others from our school who might be interested. Subsequently, two other students were also phone interviewed and were offered internships for the winter semester. While none of these three would have been considered geniuses in our accounting program, they certainly became pioneers for our department. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In January of 2005, I became the Accounting Department Chair and shortly thereafter, I was asked to assist in accompanying students from the College of Business and Communication on an internship expedition to New York City. In March of that year, I went on my first internship expedition. As part of the trip, I made arrangements to visit our three interning students and their firm. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
During the office visit I was able to talk with one of their managers. She said to me, &quot;Where is this BYU-Idaho? I had never heard of it before your students came on board. And where did these kids come from? They are wonderful. They work hard. They are willing to accept any assignment given. They are always helping one another. They are constantly cheerful and have a smile on their faces. And they don&#39;t come to work on Monday mornings hung over.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My thoughts quickly turned to President Eyring&#39;s prophecy and while fighting back the tears, all I could quietly say to her was, &quot;Come with me to Rexburg!&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A most peaceful feeling came over me and I knew at that time that our accounting students were going to be alright and that our program would be successful. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
After the initial placement of those three students, we have experienced continued success in placing our students with this firm and with others throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our majors nearly always receive full-time job offers from their internships. They are also being accepted by excellent accounting graduate schools and in many cases are receiving wonderful financial packages to attend those schools. I humbly testify that the Lord has his hand in this university&#39;s affairs and I am so grateful to be a small part of it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am ashamed that my trust was lacking in the beginning. I should have known that because of the prophecies given about this university, the Lord would see fit to find a way for them to come to pass. I don&#39;t know why I was fortunate enough to have been directly involved in hearing the fulfillment of President Eyring&#39;s prophecy, but I am certainly grateful for the experience. Because of it, my trust in the Lord has been greatly magnified. Psalms 28:7 describes my feelings. 
</p>
<p>
	The <em>Lord</em> is my strength and my shield; my heart <em>trusted in him</em>, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. (Psalms 28:7, emphasis added) 
	</p>
<p>
I am very thankful for all of my life experiences. Some have not been so pleasant, but all of them have provided me with opportunities to develop trust in the Lord. I have learned that when I trust in Him and am obedient, He will certainly be my pilot and He will help me steer my ship in the right direction. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My young friends, as you take over the helm of your ships on this voyage called the sea of life, you will have to endure life&#39;s storms by sailing through your own trials and tribulations. You will not likely know what your trials may be, but they will surely come. May you learn to trust the Lord and allow Him to be your pilot. He will not forsake you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
May we all learn to do as Nephi so simply, yet eloquently stated: O <em>Lord</em>, I have <em>trusted in</em> thee, and I will <em>trust in </em>thee forever... (2 Nephi 4:34, emphasis added). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

As a new General Authority one of my first assignments was to serve in the North America Northeast Area. The area included the eastern portions of the United States and Canada and was under the supervision of Elder M. Russell Ballard. During my period of service a decision was made to hold a training meeting for all of the stake and mission presidents, together with their wives, serving in the area. Under the leadership of Elder Ballard permission was obtained from the Reorganized Church, now known as the Community of Christ church, who are the owners of the Kirtland Temple building, to hold a sacrament meeting in the temple which would be presided over by Latter-day Saint Melchizedek Priesthood holders. This permission came with some reluctance on the part of several influential members of their church and with the stipulation that monitors from their church would attend the meeting to insure that nothing would occur which might be out of harmony with its sacred nature. I was later told that never before had such permission been granted, which meant, if correct, that this was the first time since the Church moved from Kirtland in the late 1830s that a meeting of our Church members under our priesthood authority had been held in this temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
On the day of the meeting the hall filled to overflowing. The General Authorities who had been invited to attend were present on the priesthood pulpits located on the west end of the main floor assembly room. We sang the hymn &quot;The Spirit of God,&quot; one of the hymns sung at the original dedication of the temple in 1836. The sacrament was administered and invited testimonies shared. It was evident that this was no ordinary meeting. Eyes filled with tears. Testimonies were uttered with emotion packed voices. Something different and unusual was happening. My own emotions were almost overpowering. The presence of the Savior, to me, seemed a reality. It was so real I could not bring myself to open my eyes during the sacrament. I felt as though I could reach out and touch him. It was one of those rare, powerful experiences that stays with you a lifetime and is always remembered with the same clarity as though it had happened yesterday.&nbsp;Following the meeting I talked with several who had similar experiences and heard one General Authority say, &quot;Something special happened there.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A friend of mine who lives in Kirtland shared a letter he received not long after the meeting. It was written by one of the Priesthood leaders in attendance. I quote a portion of that letter: 
</p>
<p>
	From the very moment I stepped in the door, I felt the spirit all around us as if this was a key moment in the history of the world.... The testimony meeting proceeded and from beginning to end it was a nonstop spiritual high, and a feeling that can only be described by saying it actually felt as if [we] were in heaven in the presence of our Lord and our Heavenly Father, and I think we might have been. During this time I felt no wrongs. I knew no evil, and thought of no wrong thoughts. Indeed one might say that Satan was bound while we were in that building.... At that time I began to cry, not tears of anger or sorrow but of extreme happiness and love. 
	</p>
<p>
My Kirtland friend also shared with me notes from his journal describing a talk given by a man 
we will call Will, a member of the reorganized Church and one of&nbsp;those assigned to monitor the meeting: Again, I quote only portions of that journal entry: 
</p>
<p>
	Will was bitter about permission being extended to LDS leaders to hold a sacrament meeting in the Kirtland temple.... He complained to his leaders, even objecting four times to Wallace Smith, the president of the RLDS Church.... Finally he was told to cease objecting. He had to accept the decision. He didn&#39;t want to be there Saturday. As he sat there he said he was physically ill. As the General Authorities each stood up and spoke, he could tell that the congregation was having a deeply moving spiritual experience, but he couldn&#39;t feel it because he was so bitter about them there. At that point he recognized the spirit and received a &quot;spiritual spanking&quot; of the type he never wanted to receive again. An audible voice came to him with these statements: &quot;William, this is not your house. This is my house. These are my Saints. This is an acceptable activity in this sacred place.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
Can you now see why I love the Temple? It is the Lord&#39;s house and we are his guests. Things of eternity can open to us in the Temple. Revelation does come. Peace rests upon us and comfort graces our lives. It is indeed a sacred place! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I saw that same love for the temple in Bangkok Thailand while Sister Kofford and I accompanied President and Sister Hinckley on a visit to that country. A special meeting had been called by the Prophet so that he could speak to the Saints and see a few old friends. He had been associated with that part of the world in an earlier assignment and had dedicated the land of Thailand to the preaching of the Gospel. He arrived early to the meeting only to find the hall filled to overflowing. All waited in reverence and silence. The President moved around the hall, speaking to old friends, saying hello to the aging sister who had translated the Book of Mormon into the Thai language and listening to their concerns. I was aware that the thing foremost on their minds was having a temple of their own. As the meeting progressed the Prophet began to talk about temples. It was obvious that he could feel their love for the temple. Their eyes glistened, their attention focused on every word. And then, for no apparent reason he looked into their eyes and said something like: &quot;I know you want a temple and I promise you that if you will be faithful you will in time have one.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It was clear to him as it was to all of us in his company that the Thai saints love the temple. They attend other temples as often as their time and money allow. The beautiful thing is that while they wait for <em>their </em>temple they love the temple and they love the Lord. Their thirst for temple worship is evident and someday the prophet&#39;s promise will come true. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The story was much the same in Kathmandu Nepal where I met with a humble branch president, his wife, and daughter. They too wanted to go to the temple. Their love for the temple was real. It was genuine and it was complete. While they had very little hope of ever getting to the temple, their love sustained them in total obedience to the Lord&#39;s commandments. Their love brought them peace, it brought them revelation, it brought them hope but they knew as you know that without the ordinances of the House of the Lord eternal life cannot be obtained. You will be interested to know that through personal sacrifice and a miracle of generosity they were able to attend the House of the Lord and realize their dreams. Yes, they love the temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Finally, let me tell you about a Hong Kong, China, couple and their love of the temple. They fell in love and wanted very much to be sealed in the temple but it appeared impossible. Non-member parents did not offer encouragement and were not willing to assist in financing the trip. Knowing that the closest temple was some distance away they felt helpless. They were in love. They desperately wanted to marry. They discussed all possibilities. All alternatives were considered and rejected. Their love of the temple was stronger than all of the obstacles. Ultimately, they came upon an idea. They decided to become engaged and begin saving their money. To hasten that day they adopted a plan. They would arrange for a date, but instead of going out they would each put the money they would have spent on the date and any other extra money they might have into their temple fund. They waited about five years before they finally were married in the temple.&nbsp;Yes, they loved the temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
True love of the temple like true love of anything good must be nourished and tended. Like all things worthwhile, it comes and is maintained at a price. Just as love for another withers and may die without being tended, so too does true love of the temple. May I now offer five steps that if taken help you obtain or maintain true love for the temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Temples are essential to the success of our Heavenly Father&#39;s Plan. He has said with simplicity for all to hear: &quot;My work and my glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&quot; (Moses: 1:39). That is the reason the earth was created. It is the reason for mankind to be upon the earth. It is the reason He has labored with His children from the time of Adam to now. Two goals (or if you are a purist two parts of one goal) the first, immortality for everyone and second, eternal life for those who qualify. The first required the Atonement. The second requires ordinances administered in His Holy House.... A temple and obedience to all of God&#39;s commandments.&nbsp;The simple fact is that without these ordinances there cannot be eternal life. If the Temple fails, God&#39;s plan fails. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We gain great insight into the Lord&#39;s feelings about His house from the following recorded in Church and individual records concerning what occurred on the afternoon of the day the Kirtland Temple was dedicated:&nbsp;&quot;a noise was heard like the sound of a rushing mighty wind which filled the Temple, and all the congregation simultaneously arose, being moved&nbsp;upon by an invisible power; many began to speak in tongues and prophesy, others saw glorious visions, and beheld the Temple was filled with angels. ... Others saw angels hovering over the temple and heard heavenly angels singing.&quot;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
To me that description sounds like Heaven itself was filled with joy and happiness because there was now a House of the Lord on this earth. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One final thought to help you understand the Lord&#39;s love of the temple. On April 3, 1836, as recorded in section 110 verses 6 through 9 of the D&amp;C, the Lord appeared in an area of the west end pulpit of the main floor and among other things said: 
</p>
<p>
	Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my&nbsp;name.&nbsp;For behold, I have accepted this house and my name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house. Yea, the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and&nbsp;the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. 
	</p>
<p>
Are you now able to understand the importance of the temple? Can you see how our Heavenly Father and our Savior feel about the temple? If they love it as much as they do would it not be well for us to love it also? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Many of you here today are descendants of those who gave of their meager belongings along with their time and energy to build the first Temple in this dispensation. The story of the untold hardship and sacrifice endured by these faithful members is among the greatest stories in this world&#39;s history. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Eliza R. Snow wrote: &quot; Had it not been for the assurance that God had spoken,.... An attempt towards building that temple, under the then existing conditions, would have been.... pronounced preposterous.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Karl Ricks Anderson a preeminent authority on the Kirtland era has said of this enterprise: &quot;The cost of the building, estimated at about $40,000, was a staggering sum for the 1830&#39;s. Relative to the meager resources of the Saints at that time, the Kirtland Temple is probably the most costly temple ever constructed by the Church.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brigham Young recorded that the church members were &quot;too few in numbers, too weak in faith, and too poor in purse, to attempt such a mighty enterprise.... A mere handful of men, living on air, and a little hominy and milk.... with the laborers on the walls, holding the sword in one&nbsp;hand to protect themselves from the mob, while they placed a stone and moved the trowel with the other&quot;<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At the time of the commencement of work on the Kirtland Temple my great-great-grandfather, Artemus Millet, was a wealthy construction contractor living in the area of Toronto, Canada. He was also a non-member of the Church. It has been said that he was surprised to find Brigham Young at his door saying that he had been sent by Joseph Smith to convert him to the Church and that he was to leave his business and come to Kirtland to assist in the construction of the temple. Brigham also said that Joseph wanted him to bring $1000 so they could buy supplies. Artemus was baptized, left his business in the hands of employees, and went to Kirtland where he worked tirelessly on the temple. Accidents and fatigue weakened him physically, he gave liberally of his funds and in the end had little of economic worth left. His wife died leaving him with four children. In short he, along with numerous others, gave everything he had to the building of the temple. He later followed the Saints to Nauvoo where he again worked on the temple, giving all that he had and more. Is there any doubt in your mind that Artemus loved the temple? It is probable that most of you have ancestors about whom a similar story could be told. It almost seems improper to even raise the question: do you think they loved the temple? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This same spirit of consecration and sacrifice can be found in the construction of all of the earlier temples of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When you find yourself looking for reasons to love the temple, think of those who went before you and contemplate what they gave that we might enjoy the profound blessing of temple worship. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1840 while speaking at a funeral service for a Nauvoo high counselor named Seymour Brunson, Joseph Smith announced the doctrine of baptism for the dead.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The announcement was electric. The saints promptly joined together in the Mississippi River to participate in the ordinance. Clarification of the central role of Baptisms for the Dead came the following year in what is now the section 124 vs. 29 and 30 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Lord instructed:&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead&nbsp;&#8212; For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build a house unto me. 
	</p>
<p>
In that same revelation the Lord, noting that there was not a baptismal font upon the face of the earth, instructed his people to build a temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A letter from Joseph to the Saints dated September of 1842 set forth in detail the record keeping and certifying requirements imposed by the Lord on such baptisms and then, as if to underscore the great importance of Baptisms for the Dead, the Lord gave a revelation now found in section 127 in which he states at verse 18: 
</p>
<p>
	... It is sufficient to know. In this case, that the earth will be smitten 
	with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other&nbsp;between 
	the fathers, and the children, upon some subject or other
	&#8212; <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&nbsp;</span>and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also.... 
	</p>
<p>
There it is in simple concise language: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Can you see now why love for the temple is so important? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In May of 1842 the Prophet Joseph invited a small group of men, including Hyrum 
Smith and Brigham Young, to meet with him in the upper room of his red brick 
store in Nauvoo. In two years he would be dead and vital ordinances needed for 
eternal life had not yet been revealed. In the period preceding this meeting 
Joseph had enlisted the aid of priesthood holders in rearranging the room to &quot;approximate the interior of the temple as much as circumstances would permit.&quot;<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>There followed a most amazing period of instruction in which the manner of conducting the endowment ordinance was explained and its purpose revealed. Brigham Young would later record that he learned the ceremony by heart while listening to the Prophet so that when the Nauvoo Temple opened he was able to instruct in the proper administration of the ordinance. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A few months before the dedication of the Kirtland Temple the Prophet had advised the Twelve: &quot;The endowment you are so anxious about you cannot comprehend now, nor could Gabriel explain it to the understanding of your dark minds.&quot;<sup>7</sup> In straight forward language he essentially said &quot;you are not yet spiritually ready&quot;. Referring to the upper room meeting he would later say that what he had taught: &quot;... were of things spiritual and to be received only by the spiritually minded&quot;. He added that these same truths would be taught to all of the Saints &quot;as soon as they are prepared to receive and a proper place is prepared to communicate them&quot;. The proper place was the temple! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An explanation of the endowment was given by President Brigham Young: &quot;Your endowment is to receive all of those ordinances in the House of the Lord which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, being enabled to give them the key words, the signs and tokens, pertaining to the Holy Priesthood and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell.&quot;<sup>8 </sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Expanding greatly on the doctrine of work for the dead, the prophet also taught that it is the privilege of those who have received their own endowment to go to the temple and participate in the ordinance as proxy for deceased persons. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Sadly Joseph did not live to see the completion of the House of the Lord in Nauvoo nor the first endowment session ever held in this dispensation but his revelation of this ordinance can only be described as monumental. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Reserved, protected, and held in sacredness until the people were spiritually minded enough to receive it thus being enabled to pass by &quot;the angels who stand as sentinels,&quot; this incomparable gift from the Lord has been made available to all who love His house and enter therein. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The end of the Prophet&#39;s life was just a little over a year away when he first publicly taught the doctrine of the sealing ordinance, frequently called temple marriage. To me it is appropriate to view this ordinance as the capstone ordinance of the gospel. In May of 1843, a little over a year after the endowment was explained, it first appeared almost as a headline. Found today in section 131 of the D&amp;C it reads with elementary simplicity: 
</p>
<p>
	In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; and in order to obtain the&nbsp;highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the&nbsp;new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; and if he does not he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase. 
	</p>
<p>
But, the Lord was not yet finished. Joseph&#39;s assignment to restore the fullness of the gospel required still one more revelation relating to temple marriage. That revelation, found in section 132, is as profound and deep as section 131 is simple and direct. Here doctrine which is best taught by the Spirit is set forth. Here only the spiritually prepared may enter. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Holy Temple, home to this magnificent ordinance, holds the power and authority to bind a man and a women together in the bonds of holy marriage and their children to them in an eternal family unit not only for this life, but for eternity. Family relationships can last forever. No longer does the loss of mortal life need to include the loss of eternal families. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Can you imagine the import of what this means? Even here, even now, can you not feel in your heart and soul the joy that comes to those who qualify and become heirs to the blessings of the sealing ordinance? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so, here we are today, a beautiful temple in our midst. A House of the Lord home to all that our Heavenly Father and our Savior love and desire for us. Home to the memory of the sacrifice and tribulation of those who have gone before. Home to baptisms for the dead. Home to the sacredness of the endowment. Home to the blessings of the sealing ordinance and I pray that it may also be home to your love, your heart and you.

It is a privilege to speak to you today and I pray that the Spirit will help all of us receive a very personal message as I share my remarks. I often ask my students, what one condition is required for personal growth. Think about it yourself. What one condition, if you could choose only one, would enable the greatest degree of personal growth in your own work, learning, and throughout your life? More often than not, most discussions with my students eventually point to the power of personal agency. Today I would like to explore this theme of agency and personal growth. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I will begin my message with a story about a friend from Boston, whom I will call Junior. His story, at least the part I will share today, is about <em>three choices</em> that have had a profound impact on his life. Junior was a teenager growing up in a rough part of the city. His parents were converts to the Church who had immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic-good people with strong testimonies of the restored Gospel. But Junior wasn&#39;t sure how he felt about his own testimony. He liked his non-member friends. He was considering joining a band, and he had the dread-lock hair style to fit the part. Junior was willing to attend Church, but he really went in support of his parents. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Six years ago Junior responded to an invitation to attend a youth conference. Unsure whether he wanted to spend an entire weekend with a group of religious people, he initially declined. The night before the conference, he felt a spiritual prompting. To the surprise of many of his leaders, Junior <em>made the decision</em> to attend. Something happened that weekend where, for the first time, Junior felt that God had spoken directly to him. The seeds of a personal testimony began to grow. A year later, and at the encouragement of his younger brother, Junior <em>made the decision </em>to attend BYU-Idaho. Leaving the familiar setting of Boston and moving to Rexburg, Idaho was a big change. But with the transition came many blessings. Junior was matched with great roommates, a strong spiritual environment, and caring faculty. One of his roommates was a returned missionary from New York who also shared a Dominican heritage. All Fall semester, Junior talked with his roommate about the impact a mission would have on in his life. No one in Junior&#39;s family had ever served a mission, but through the example of his roommate and direction from the Spirit, Junior <em>made the decision</em> to serve a mission. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Junior has become a powerful missionary and is a different young man than the boy I met six years ago. But while he always had divine potential, it was his <em>decisions</em> that shaped who he has become. In each of these decisions, Junior received encouragement from good shepherds-a young men&#39;s leader, a sibling, and a college roommate. But in each situation, all of the influence in the world would not have mattered if Junior, exercising his personal agency, had not made a decision and acted on it. 
</p>
<p>
Today I&#39;d like to explore with you the Power of Personal Agency. In the Doctrine and Covenants Section 58 verses 27 through 28 the Lord teaches: &quot;Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the <em>power is in them</em>, wherefore they are agents unto themselves.&quot; Each of us has divine potential-The Lord explains: &quot;The power is in us,&quot; but it is only when we use our agency wisely that our decisions lead to divine potential. As &nbsp;President Monson has taught: &quot;Decisions Determine Destiny.&quot;<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I would like to explore the power of personal agency by considering three key ideas: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A key to understanding the power of personal agency is to recognize that it is one of <em>the</em> core doctrines underlying the Plan of Salvation itself. In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith we learn: &quot;Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be. All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the agency of man.&quot;<sup>2</sup> It is our agency that made us who we are and it is the use of our agency that will shape who we become. God knew that for us to become like him, we needed the ability to choose, to act, and to grow. But Satan sought to take away this power. In Moses we read: &quot;[T]hat Satan . . . came before me, saying Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost. . . Wherefore, . . . that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I the Lord had given him.&quot;<sup>3</sup> And he led others away: &quot;And also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me <em>because of their agency</em>.&quot;<sup>4</sup> The tragic irony is that gift they were trying to deny in that Council in Heaven, was the very condition that allowed them to disagree in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the Russian novel <em>The Brother&#39;s Karamazov, </em>we read an allegorical story set in the Spanish Inquisition where the dominant church has worked hard to control the behavior of its people. When the Savior returns to earth, the Grand Inquisitor intercedes to challenge the Savior by saying: &quot;Thou wouldst go into the world, . . . with some promise of freedom, which men in their simplicity and natural unruliness cannot even understand. . .Instead of taking possession of man&#39;s freedom, Thou didst increase it.&quot; The argument was that our limited capacity would make us incapable of wisely using such a powerful gift as agency. I am sure these and many other arguments were put forth in the Council in Heaven. And it is clear that they were persuasive enough to deceive a third part of the host of heaven. But no matter how passionately advocated, <em>all</em> of these arguments were wrong. The only way we could grow and become like our father was through the righteous use of our agency. God cannot force personal growth-our very nature required the preservation of agency. Our ability to unlock our divine potential could not happen without the ability to make choices and learn from consequences. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The battle over agency continues in our lives today. Satan continues to do everything he can to steal the agency of man. The cleverness of his approach is that he sets traps that cause us to ensnare ourselves. President Monson compared this to a Tongan Fisherman&#39;s snare called a maka-feke.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Note that the trap is simply constructed-it consists of a shell, lashed to a line that is lowered over a reef to lure an octopus. Once the octopus grabs onto the bait, the fisherman begins to pull his victim to the surface. At any point in the process, all the octopus needs to do is to simply let go. But its desire to hold on is so powerful that the victim is eventually led to it&#39;s destruction. While there are many maka-feke&#39;s that cause us to forfeit our agency, I would like to focus on four: False Traditions, Addiction, Financial Bondage, and Sin.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As we try to avoid the traps that destroy our agency, we can also take efforts to expand our ability to make good choices. I will focus on four actions: Self-Management, Focusing on What We Can Control, Listening to the Sprit, and Following the Savior.

I learned the power personal agency can play in the lives of others when I served in a stake young men&#39;s presidency. We gave everything we had to the youth of that stake: knowing their names, investing in their lives, and serving them in every way we knew how. This is a picture of that young men&#39;s presidency taken at 2:00 in the morning as we prepared on the eve of a youth event. But there is one thing that is wrong with this picture (besides the fact that it is 2:00 in the morning). There are no youth in the room. In our desire to serve, we had excluded the youth from the very activities that would have lead to their greatest growth. Fortunately, we soon ran into an experience that would change our service forever. In planning for a youth conference, we wanted to explore how perceptions of &quot;what is cool&quot; can be shaped by media and popular culture. Well, try as we might, four married men working at desk jobs were not going to tell the youth &quot;what was cool.&quot; We were forced to involve the youth in developing the themes, writing the content, and leading the discussions. Our responsibility to direct and sharpen the experience did not diminish. But the youth were engaged in a role we had never experienced. By doing less, we had allowed our youth to do more. For me this story had implications not only for my service in the stake, but as a parent, a leader, and a teacher. <em>Preach my Gospel</em> explains, &quot;While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own.&quot;<sup>18</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As you reflect on your experience at BYU-Idaho I hope you will recognize how you are being given opportunities to act and take responsibility for your own growth. Consider for a moment the types of experiences you are having at BYU-Idaho. The following language comes directly from the mission statements or guiding principles of some of the programs that are so much a part of our lives at this university: 
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Personal Honor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsible for Behavior 
	</p>
<p>
	Student Living&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal Accountability and Individual Responsibility 
	</p>
<p>
	Activities Program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act, Participate, Choose 
	</p>
<p>
	Heber J. Grant Program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Reliance and Stewardship 
	</p>
<p>
	Learning Model&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Act and Take Responsibility for Learning 
	</p>
<p>
One of the purposes of Personal Honor is to teach us to be <em>responsible</em> for our own behavior. Student Living helps teach <em>personal accountability</em> and <em>individual responsibility </em>in the apartment. Three of the guiding principles of the BYU-Idaho Activities program are to help students <em>act</em>, rather than be acted upon, <em>participate</em> rather than be spectators, and <em>choose</em> their own level of participation. The Heber J. Grant program focuses on <em>self-reliance</em> and <em>stewardship</em> over decisions and opportunities. Perhaps more clearly than any other effort, the BYU-Idaho Learning Model encourages all of us to <em>act</em> and <em>take responsibility</em> for learning by preparing and teaching one another. These initiatives were developed independently, but I do not believe that it is by chance that the principles of personal agency can be found in each of the mission statements or guiding principles of these efforts. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I conclude, I would like to return to the beginning of our discussion of the Council in Heaven. I mentioned earlier that one of the key doctrines of the Plan of Salvation is agency. However, the doctrine of agency had to be complemented with the doctrine of the atonement or the plan would have been incomplete. Our Heavenly Father knew that for us to grow and become like him, we would need to use our agency to act and make our own decisions. He also knew that this would also allow us to make mistakes. Regardless of the source of our sin, all of us are imperfect and fall short of the expectations of our Father. The demands of justice will not allow us to return to Him without an infinite atonement. The Savior explained this in a revelation to the prophet Joseph Smith when he said: &quot;Therefore I command you to repent-repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger and your sufferings be sore-how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not. For behold, I, God have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I.&quot;<sup>19</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Henry B. Eyring shared an insight that came as he pondered this passage on atonement: &quot;First, if I could not repent to qualify for His atonement for my sins, I must suffer to the limit of my power to suffer. And, second, with all the requisite suffering of my own, with all I could bear, it would still not be enough. I would still be forever shut out. . . In that moment the penalty for taking chances with sin or with forgiveness loomed larger than I had ever imagined it could.&quot;<sup>20</sup> In 2 Nephi we are taught that &quot;it is by <em>grace </em>we are saved, after all we can do.&quot;<sup>21</sup> Certainly it is so important for us to use our agency to do all we can, but we are still saved by <em>His</em> grace. Agency gave us the ability to grow and improve, but we can never grow into our true potential unless we choose to accept the atonement in our lives and follow the path of repentance. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I hope you have used our time together to reflect upon the importance of agency in the plan of salvation and in your own personal growth. I pray that we will avoid the self-entrapment of false traditions, addiction, financial bondage and sin. Moreover, I hope we will expand our agency by strengthening efforts at self-management, focusing on what we can control, listening to the Spirit and following the Savior. As we make efforts to expand our agency, each of us will be blessed with increased intellectual, professional, and spiritual growth. But I also pray we will remember the companion doctrine of the atonement and repentance. I leave my witness that it is through His atonement that we find the growth each of us will need in order to return to our Father in Heaven. I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

As many of you are aware, the past few days have been very overwhelming for me. Yesterday, in the upper room of the temple the 14 men we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators, placed their hands on my head, and with President Monson as voice, ordained me an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. The feelings I have felt are indescribable, and the responsibility<strong> </strong>is so very heavy. I pray for your faith and prayers that the Lord might mold me into what I must become. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Speaking to the graduates I say: Your achievement today is significant. Many across the world dream of coming to such a place as BYU-Idaho. Few are given the opportunity; fewer still are found at this commencement. It is a grand accomplishment and I congratulate you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We often think of our university days as days for acquiring knowledge, and so they are. We are thankful for all you have learned. My subject today is the acquiring of wisdom. In simple terms we will describe wisdom as discernment and judgment in the application of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We now live in a world of information overload. Perhaps symbolic of this world is the amazing Wikipedia. For those few in the audience of my age who do not know what Wikipedia is, it is the world&#39;s largest online encyclopedia. To give you its scope, it has over a billion words, 10 million articles across some 200 languages. There are more than 70 language versions of Wikipedia that have at least 10,000 articles each. There are 2.5 million articles in the English version.<sup><a href="#1.">1 
</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our information overload is evidenced as well in the explosive use of social networking sites such as Facebook, founded in 2004, but now with more than 175 million active users worldwide,<sup><a href="#2">2</a> </sup>or YouTube, launched in 2005, where some video clips have reportedly been viewed more than 100 million times. (It will be interesting to some of you that during some time periods this past weekend General Conference was the most discussed topic on Twitter with more than 8,000 &quot;tweets.&quot;) (For you parents, you need not worry that you don&#39;t have any idea what I just said.) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In this information tidal wave, how desperately we need wisdom, wisdom to sort through and discern how to apply what we are learning. T. S. Eliot, a believing Christian who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948, penned the beautiful &quot;Choruses from The Rock.&quot; It speaks to our world today<strong>:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	O world of spring and autumn, birth and dying! 
	</p>
<p>
	The endless cycle of idea and action, 
	</p>
<p>
	Endless invention, endless experiment, 
	</p>
<p>
	Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; 
	</p>
<p>
	Knowledge of speech, but not of silence; 
	</p>
<p>
	Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word. 
	</p>
<p>
	All our knowledge brings us nearer to death, 
	</p>
<p>
	But nearness to death no nearer to God. 
	</p>
<p>
	Where is the Life we have lost in living? 
	</p>
<p>
	Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? 
	</p>
<p>
	Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? 
	</p>
<p>
	The cycles of heaven in twenty centuries 
	</p>
<p>
	Brings us farther from God and nearer to the Dust. 
	</p>
<p>
Where are you, graduates, on the wisdom scale? Some here might relate to the young lady, excited about her upcoming marriage, who exclaimed to her parents, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m getting married. I&#39;m at the end of all my troubles.&quot; And her mother whispered to her father, &quot;Yes, but she doesn&#39;t know at which end.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The more I learn about the wisdom of God, the more I believe I am only at the beginning end of wisdom. It humbles me as I realize how much I have to learn. Today, I hope to increase our desire to acquire wisdom and specifically the wisdom of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I want to emphasize several principles of wisdom. First, in our age of information and knowledge, we must seek after wisdom. Wisdom is multi-dimensional and comes in different sizes and colors. Wisdom gained early brings enormous blessings. Wisdom in one area may not be transferable to another. And finally, the wisdom of the world, while in many cases very valuable, is most valuable when it humbly bows to the wisdom of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The scriptures describe two types of wisdom: the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God. The wisdom of the world has both a positive and a negative component. In the darkest description, it could be described as a partial truth, mixed with intelligence and manipulation, to achieve selfish or evil purposes. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An example from the Book of Mormon is the man Amlici. The scriptures say that<strong>, </strong>&quot;a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea,<i> a wise man as to the wisdom of the world</i>...[drew] away much people after him.&quot;<sup><a href="#3">3</a> </sup>The scriptures go on to describe Amlici as a &quot;wicked man, [whose] intent [was] to destroy the church of God.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> No one in this room is interested in this kind of wisdom. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There is another kind of wisdom of the world that is not nearly so sinister. In fact it is very positive. This wisdom is consciously acquired through study, reflection, observation, and hard work. It is very valuable and helpful in the things we do. To good and decent people, it comes as we experience our mortality. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You will remember Mark Twain&#39;s comment, &quot;When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.&quot;<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> If we are observant, if we are thoughtful, time can teach us much. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I remember at the time of my graduation from college. I traveled from BYU to Preston, Idaho where my grandmother, Mary Keller, lived. She was then 78 years old and frail. She passed away two years later. She was a marvelous lady and I knew that if I would listen and learn from her experiences, I could learn wisdom that would help me along the way. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We can pole-vault over many of the sad experiences that come to some in life by obtaining wisdom early-beyond our age. Seek after this wisdom-be reflective, observe carefully, think about what you experience in life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We can also learn wisdom in our specific professional and personal pursuits. Let me give you two examples. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Dr. DeVon C. Hale is a physician in Salt Lake City who grew up in Idaho Falls. I have marveled at his knowledge and his wisdom as it concerns tropical diseases. It is not just Dr. Hale&#39;s knowledge but his understanding of how to apply that knowledge, sorting through several layers, and judging one against the other. It is a blessing to have that kind of medical wisdom for missionaries across the world. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A second example: When our oldest son began elementary school in our home in Tampa, Florida, we were anxious to meet his kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Judith Graybell. She was a woman in her fifties and had an amazing ability with young children. She knew just how to motivate them, when to praise them, and when to be firm with them. She had the knowledge to teach them but she had much more. We worked hard to get each of our children in her kindergarten classroom. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These two people demonstrate selective wisdom in the world. Their wisdom helps many around them, and allows them to be successful in their professions. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
However, we should realize the limitations of this wisdom. The wisdom in one area may not necessarily carry into wisdom in another. For example, I may not want Mrs. Graybell diagnosing tropical diseases and I may not want Dr. Hale teaching my child&#39;s kindergarten class. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
More importantly, the wisdom that brings success in the world must be willing to step behind the wisdom of God and not think that it can substitute for it. The wisdom of God is wisdom with a large W. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Remember: All wisdom is not created equal. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Psalmist said, &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&quot;<sup><a href="#6">6</a> </sup>What the scripture means is that a &quot;profound reverence&quot; for the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (See Marion G. Romney, &quot;Converting Knowledge into Wisdom,&quot; <em>Ensign</em>, Jul 1983, 2). That profound reverence comes because our Heavenly Father, &quot;has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth&quot;<sup><a href="#7">7</a> </sup>His wisdom is perfect. It is pure, it is unselfish. It is wisdom with a large W. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This wisdom, at times, will be opposite the wisdom of the world, meaning the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world will come in direct conflict one with another. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Remember the words of the Lord in Isaiah? &quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&quot;<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The wisdom of God will not come to us by entitlement, we must be willing to seek after it. &quot;If any of you lack 
<i>wisdom</i>, let him <i>ask</i> of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&quot;<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The wisdom of God is a spiritual gift. As President Clark mentioned.<strong> </strong>&quot;<i>Seek not for riches but for wisdom</i>, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich.&quot;<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Seeking for the wisdom of God is always accompanied by obedience to the commandments. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Generally, the spiritual gift of wisdom comes step-by-step as we honestly and diligently seek it. &quot;I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept...and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts...for they shall learn 
<i>wisdom</i>; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.&quot;<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Joseph Smith said this, &quot;The things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out.&quot;<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> My friends, there is no instant gratification in seeking for the wisdom of God. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Finally, the source of the wisdom of God is different from that of the world. The wisdom of God is found in the scriptures, in the teachings of the prophets (such as in the past week in General Conference), and of course in our prayers (See Doctrine and Covenants 8:1-2). And always, 
<i>always</i> this wisdom distills upon us with the power of the Holy Ghost. Quoting Paul: &quot;For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God ... not in the words which
<i>man&#39;s wisdom</i><u> teacheth</u>, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.&quot;<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With the wisdom of God we see beyond our current circumstances because<strong> </strong>as the scripture says &quot;[the Spirit] speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be.&quot;<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The wisdom of God, wisdom with a large W, is wisdom worthy of our devoted attention. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important point I will teach you today is that not all wisdom is created equal. We need to learn that when there is conflict between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God, that we must yield our will to the wisdom of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We are the sons and daughters of God. We are spiritual beings on a mortal mission. We, who are devoted to learning the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God, must not become confused with which wisdom has the large W. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let me share an experience from a noble Latter-day Saint in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. She tells of her struggle between paying her tithing or her tuition. Here are her words: 
</p>
<p>
	The university...prohibited the students that were in debt, or who had not paid their tuition, from taking tests. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	I remember a time, [quoting her], when I...faced serious financial difficulties. It was a Thursday when I received my salary. When I figured the monthly budget, I noticed that there wouldn&#39;t be enough to pay [both] my tithing and my university. I would have to choose between them. The bimonthly tests would start the following week, and if I didn&#39;t take them I could lose the school year. I felt great agony. ... My heart ached.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p>
Here was a direct conflict between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God. Although you are very good and righteous, you will find in your life, if you are truthful with yourself, your heart will ache as you feel some of these conflicts coming up before you. I return to her story: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First, She paid her tithing on Sunday. The following Monday she recounted what happened: 
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;The working period was ending when my employer approached and gave the last orders of the day. ... Suddenly, he halted, and asked, &quot;How is your college?&quot; [She described him as a harsh man, and all she could say was:] &lsquo;Everything is all right!&#39; [He then left.] 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the secretary entered the room. [She said]: &quot;The employer has just said that from today on, the company is going to pay fully for your college and your books. Before you leave, stop at my desk and inform me of the costs so that tomorrow I can give you the check.&quot;<sup><a href="#15">15</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
If you are perceptive, you will find that you are confronted with these types of tests many times throughout your life. Where will you put your trust? Listen to the Lord&#39;s warning to us. Directly to us. &quot;O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned [the wisdom of the world], they <em>think </em>they are <em>wise</em>, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, [the wisdom of the world], wherefore, their <em>wisdom</em> is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish. But to be learned, [the wisdom of the world], is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.&quot;<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now from the apostle Paul: &quot;Where is the wise? ...hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?&quot;<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> &quot;Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. For the <em>wisdom of &nbsp;this world </em>is foolishness with God.&quot;<sup><a href="#18">18</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The test is often whether we will allow the wisdom of God to be our guiding course when it moves opposite the wisdom of the world. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mormon lamented, &quot;for they will not seek wisdom, [meaning the wisdom of God], neither do they desire that she should rule over them.&quot;<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> When thinking of those who have been willing to let the wisdom of God rule over them, I think of a friend of mine from mainland China, Xie Ying (sh<font face="Arial">&#275;&#259;</font> ying), who made significant sacrifices to join the Church and is now a missionary in New York. I think of my two daughters, both very intelligent with masters degrees, but who have chosen the blessings of motherhood and children. I think of a friend from South America who left his lucrative employment when he learned taxes were being illegally evaded. All have put the wisdom of God above the wisdom of the world. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the wisdom of the world can deceive capable people. Joseph Smith said it this way, &quot;There are a great many wise men, and women too, in our midst who are too wise to be taught; therefore they must die in their ignorance, and in the resurrection they will find their mistake.&quot;<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With the difficulties in our economy, let me raise the issue of personal finances. In our current condition, we are all more humble and teachable-but think back on the last few years. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The world teaches if we want something, we should have it. We should not have to wait for it. Debt can allow us to have it now. That debt can come through credit cards or it might come through overextending the leverage on a house that we own. We can leverage what we have, even our education. Values will always go up, and we will prosper. The wisdom of the world is that the amount of the monthly payment becomes more important than the size of the loan. Our obligations are somewhat discretionary, and if all fails, bankruptcy is our last option. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, let&#39;s think of the wisdom of God on personal finances, constantly taught by the prophets. The foundation is self-reliance and work. We put money in its proper role by paying an honest tithe and being generous in our offerings. We live on less than we earn and we differentiate between our needs and our wants. We avoid debt except for the most fundamental of needs. We live within a budget. We put away some savings. We are honest in all our obligations. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Ten years ago President Hinckley warned, &quot;I am suggesting that the time has come to get our houses in order. So many of our people are living on the very edge of their incomes. In fact, some are living on borrowings...There is a portent of stormy weather ahead to which we had better give heed.&quot;<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Three years ago at the peak of our prosperity, President Monson said:&nbsp; &quot;My brothers and sisters, avoid the philosophy that yesterday&#39;s luxuries have become today&#39;s necessities. They aren&#39;t necessities unless we make them so. Many enter into long-term debt only to find that changes occur: people become ill or incapacitated, companies fail or downsize, jobs are lost, natural disasters befall us. For many reasons, payments on large amounts of debt can no longer be made. Our debt becomes as a Damocles sword hanging over our heads and threatening to destroy us. 
</p>
<p>
	I urge you to live within your means. One cannot spend more than one earns and remain solvent.<strong> </strong>I promise you that you will then be happier than you would be if you were constantly worrying about how to make the next payment on nonessential debt.<a href="#22"><sup>22</sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
Can you see how the wisdom of God can conflict with the wisdom of the world? The choice was <u>not</u> so obvious when all looked prosperous. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Many members of the Church wish they had listened more closely. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This is the wisdom of God, wisdom with a large W. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I suggest you take some of the issues facing you. Put a line down the middle of a paper. List the wisdom of the world on the left side and the wisdom of God on the right side. Write the issues in conflict one with another. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
What choices are you making? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Section 45<sup> </sup>of the Doctrine and Covenants which speaks of the events leading up to the Second Coming of the Savior, the Lord again tells the story of the ten virgins, then leaves us with these words: &quot;For they that are wise, [wisdom with a large W] and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived-verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.&quot;<sup><a href="#23">23</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let us seek after the wisdom of God. We are currently in some difficult times and I know it brings some concern as we look at jobs, and careers, and income. But there are many good and prosperous days ahead. There is much we can learn right now about wisdom. I promise you that The Lord&#39;s blessings will attend you as you seek for wisdom, the wisdom of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It seems like only yesterday, but it has been 34 years ago, that Kathy and I were at a commencement like yours here today. All the world seemed to be ahead of us. Looking back, we seem much wiser now. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One thing I have experienced completely: I have learned in very personal ways that God truly does live. He is our Father. He loves us. He is so anxious to impart His wisdom to us. And if we will be obedient and prayerful and seek after it, it will come. We must be patient, we do not receive it all at once. But I bear witness that He is a loving Father. And just as your earthly father desires good gifts for you, He desires them even more. His Son is our Savior, Jesus Christ. He lived a perfect life. He showed us wisdom through His example. In ways we do not fully understand, He took upon Him our sins on condition of our repentance. I have felt His atonement in my own life. As we repent and come unto Him, He will make us clean. I testify of His reality. That He lives. He is resurrected. He guides this holy work upon the earth. He is not absent from His prophets. I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is His prophet today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

I am grateful to be with you at the beginning of a new semester. &nbsp;I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today as I talk about something that is central to Heavenly Father&#39;s eternal plan: finding an eternal companion and creating an eternal family. &nbsp;The most important thing any of us will ever do in all eternity is to create an eternal family and with them enjoy eternal life and exaltation with our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Heavenly Father&#39;s great plan of happiness calls for us to accomplish three milestones in the creation of an eternal family: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These milestones define the great quest of our lives-to have eternal life in an eternal family with our Heavenly Father. &nbsp;We know from the words of the prophets and through the whisperings of the Holy Spirit that these eternal blessings are worth every prayer, every preparation, every effort, every sacrifice, every delay, every tear, every heartache-literally everything.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And yet, as the Lord said in the 52<sup>nd</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants, &quot;Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.&quot;<sup><a href="#1." target="_self" target="_self">1</a></sup>&nbsp;These eternal milestones- marrying in the temple, creating an eternal marriage, and building up a righteous posterity-are under attack by the forces of evil. &nbsp;Some of the attacks are blatant, while some are subtle and devious; but the effect is the same-rampant selfishness and immorality, marriage delayed, love neglected, covenants broken, fathers absent, mothers distracted, marriages torn apart, children postponed, children neglected, children spiritually and emotionally wounded, families destroyed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
You and I have been warned so that we can protect ourselves and our families against the fiery darts of the adversary. &nbsp; <br />
Again in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 52, verse 14, the Lord said: 
</p>
<p>
	&quot;I will give unto you <strong>a pattern in all things</strong>, that ye may not be deceived.&quot;<sup><a href="#2." target="_self" target="_self">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The pattern I want to share with you today comes from the story of the army of Helaman in the Book of Mormon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/02.jpg" border="0" alt="Two Thousand Young Warriors" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These two thousand young men went to war and fought with great faith and courage under the leadership of Helaman.&nbsp; Keeping in mind the courage and faith of the sons, I want to ask this question: What were their parents like? &nbsp;In the answer to that question lies the pattern that will help us prepare to reach all the eternal milestones on the great quest for eternal life in families. &nbsp;Let&#39;s look first at the fathers. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When the sons were born, their fathers were Lamanite warriors.&nbsp; In his account of the mission of the sons of Mosiah to the Lamanites, Mormon describes Lamanite society in these words: 
</p>
<p>
	. . . a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches . . . ; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering . . .&nbsp;<a href="#3." target="_self" target="_self"><sup>3</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
But those fathers (and mothers) were converted by the preaching of the sons of Mosiah, and they experienced the redeeming power of Christ.&nbsp; Inspired by the Holy Ghost, the gospel sunk deep into their hearts, and they repented of their sins. &nbsp;Of this long and difficult process their king said, 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain&mdash;<sup><a href="#4." target="_self" target="_self">4</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Out of that process came a mighty change in their hearts and in their society. &nbsp;These fierce warriors became men of God, so deeply changed that they entered into a covenant with God and buried their weapons of war deep in the earth as a testimony, 
</p>
<p>
	. . . that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;<a href="#5." target="_self" target="_self"><sup>5</sup> </a>
</p>
<p align="center">
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/04.jpg" border="0" alt="Anti-Nephi-Lehies burying swords" width="321" height="246" />
</p>
<p>
The fathers kept that covenant. They were righteous and obedient<sup><a href="#6." target="_self" target="_self">6</a></sup>men who &quot;walk[ed] in the ways of the Lord&quot;<sup><a href="#7._" target="_self" target="_self">7</a></sup> and loved their wives and their children.<sup><a href="#8." target="_self" target="_self">8</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mormon&#39;s words, they were &quot;distinguished for their zeal towards God . . . they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; they were firm in the faith of Christ,&quot;<sup><a href="#9." target="_self" target="_self">9</a> </sup>and they &quot;never did fall away.&quot;<a href="#10." target="_self" target="_self"><sup>10</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
They were also men of great courage. &nbsp;When the Lamanites attacked them, the fathers did not flee or cower, they &quot;went out to meet [the Lamanites]&quot; without weapons.<sup><a href="#11." target="_self" target="_self">11</a>&nbsp;</sup>Many of the fathers were killed (1,005) in that battle and in other attacks, but many of the Lamanites were so deeply touched by the courage and faith of the fathers that they abandoned their weapons and were converted to the gospel. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Like their husbands, the mothers of the army of Helaman experienced a marvelous conversion and change of heart.&nbsp; Mormon has given us an account of the conversion of one of the Lamanite mothers, the queen of the people of Lamoni. &nbsp;In her experience we can see the faith and spiritual power of these remarkable women. &nbsp;Please turn with me to Alma, chapter 19, verses 9 and 10. 
</p>
<p>
After Ammon had taught King Lamoni the gospel and after the Spirit had overcome the king so that he lay two days as though he were dead, the queen sought Ammon&#39;s counsel. Ammon assured her that the king was not dead, but &quot;sleepeth in God.&quot;<sup><a href="#12." target="_self" target="_self">12</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in verses 9 and 10, Ammon said to the queen: 
</p>
<p>
	. . . Believest thou this? &nbsp;And she said unto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according as thou hast said. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great faith among all the people of the Nephites.<sup><a href="#13." target="_self" target="_self">13</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
Later, after the queen had heard her husband&#39;s powerful witness of the Savior, and after she had received a marvelous witness herself, she exclaimed: 
</p>
<p>
	. . . O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! &nbsp;O blessed God, have mercy on this people!<sup><a href="#14." target="_self" target="_self">14</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Blessed with exceeding great faith, these mothers loved their husbands and nurtured their children in the ways of the Lord. &nbsp;They had tasted of the redeeming power of Christ, and they taught their sons to have faith in Him and to keep His commandments. &nbsp;And they did so in the middle of dangerous and trying times. &nbsp;While the mothers were rearing their children, the Lamanites attacked more than once and many of their husbands were killed. &nbsp;Under the Lord&#39;s direction these women left their homeland, traveled with their families to the unfamiliar land of Jershon, and there made a new home for their children.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When their sons volunteered to go off to battle, I believe the mothers obtained a witness of the Spirit that if their sons would be true and faithful, the Lord would preserve them.&nbsp; These powerful women of faith taught their boys that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them. &nbsp;These valiant young men reassured Helaman in a moment of great potential danger that: &nbsp;&quot;We do not doubt our mothers knew it.&quot;<sup><a href="#15." target="_self" target="_self">15</a> </sup>
</p>

&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/07.jpg" border="0" alt="Farewell My Stripling Warriors" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the lives of these righteous mothers and fathers, there is a pattern for us. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/08a.jpg" border="0" alt="quilt pattern" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is a pattern of deep conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ and enduring faith and trust in the grace and forgiveness of the Redeemer. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/08b.jpg" border="0" alt="quilt pieces: conversion, faith, trust" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is a pattern of mothers and fathers who loved each other and their children, who exercised leadership in their families and labored to provide abundantly.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/08c.jpg" border="0" alt="quilt pieces; love, labor, leadership" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is a pattern of courage in protecting their families, even with their own lives.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/08d.jpg" border="0" alt="quilt pieces: protection, courage" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is a pattern of teaching and nurturing children in the path of righteousness in a difficult and challenging time. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/08e.jpg" border="0" alt="quilt pieces: teaching, nurturing" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And it is a pattern of entrusting their precious children to the care of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/08f.jpg" border="0" alt="quilt piece: trust in the Lord" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The theme woven all throughout this pattern is the pure love of Christ. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Listen to the words of Ammon about these mothers and fathers: 
</p>
<p>
	Now behold, . . . we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land? &nbsp;Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.<sup><a href="#16." target="_self" target="_self">16</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
That great love came because these mothers and fathers had humbled themselves<sup><a href="#17." target="_self" target="_self">17</a></sup> and put their trust in the true and living God.<sup><a href="#18." target="_self" target="_self">18</a></sup>&nbsp;The Atonement of Christ had wrought a mighty change in their hearts,<sup><a href="#19." target="_self" target="_self">19</a></sup> and they had received a remission of their sins. &nbsp;They became true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, and He bestowed on them His pure and perfect love.<sup><a href="#20._" target="_self" target="_self">20</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, as they endured in obedience and were steadfast in meekness and humility, they were filled with the pure love of Christ.<sup><a href="#21." target="_self" target="_self">21</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That love was manifest in their faith and hope and in their devotion to their children and to each other.&nbsp; Paraphrasing the words of Mormon and Paul, these righteous mothers and fathers: 
</p>
<p>
	Suffered long, and were kind, envied not, were not puffed up, sought not their own, were not easily provoked, thought no evil, rejoiced not in iniquity, rejoiced in the truth, bore all things, believed all things, hoped all things, endured all things, and never fell away.<sup><a href="#22._" target="_self" target="_self">22</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
This pattern of righteous mothers and fathers who love with the pure love of Christ is more than 2,000 years old.&nbsp; Yet, the pattern is based on true principles that transcend cultures and geography and centuries of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Today, I would like to focus on three of those principles: obedience, service, and sacrifice. &nbsp;Applied with faith in God, these principles open our hearts to the pure love of Christ. They have, therefore, powerful implications for the three milestones in our quest for eternal life-finding an eternal companion; creating an eternal marriage; and building up a righteous posterity. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
No matter what your circumstances are, whether you are single, engaged, married, married with kids, or married with grandchildren, I want you to ask yourself this simple question: &nbsp;What should I do to apply these principles and this pattern in my life? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

</p>
<p>
Obedience to the commandments of the Lord is at the heart of Christ-like love. &nbsp;All through His earthly ministry, the Savior taught the intimate, powerful connection between obedience and love. &nbsp;Listen to His words at the Last Supper: 
</p>
<p>
	If ye love me, keep my commandments.<sup><a href="#23." target="_self" target="_self">23</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<sup><a href="#24." target="_self" target="_self">24</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father&#39;s commandments, and abide in his love.<a href="#25." target="_self" target="_self"><sup>25</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	O righteous Father, ... 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	. . . I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<a href="#26." target="_self" target="_self"><sup>26</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
The Savior calls for the kind of whole-hearted, steadfast obedience He gave to His Father. &nbsp;Whole-hearted obedience includes repentance, making and keeping sacred covenants, and opening our hearts to the Atonement of Christ and the sanctifying influence of the Spirit. Christ-like love is a fruit of the Atonement.&nbsp; It is a gift from the Savior and comes to us through the power of the Holy Ghost. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Like the fathers and mothers of the army of Helaman, we all need to bury the instruments of destruction in our lives. &nbsp;Some of those instruments may be physical-computers, video game machines, iPods, cell phones. &nbsp;Some may be spiritual-pride, self-indulgence, pessimism, addiction.&nbsp; Whatever they may be, we need to bury them and experience the mighty change of heart that only comes through the Atonement of Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Obedience is critical to every milestone of our quest for eternal life, but I want to illustrate its power at milestone #1-finding an eternal companion. &nbsp;The word &quot;eternal&quot; here means enjoying the kind of life or companionship that Heavenly Father enjoys, forever. &nbsp;That means success at milestone #1 is not only about <u>finding</u> an everlasting companion, but also about <u>becoming</u> an eternal person. 
</p>
<p>
The power of obedience and the Holy Ghost in this &quot;finding and becoming&quot; process lies in an eternal principle described in the 88<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants: 
</p>
<p>
	For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; ... truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light . . .<sup><a href="#27._" target="_self" target="_self">27</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
If you want to marry someone who is happy, intelligent, and virtuous, whose countenance is full of light, and whose heart is open to the pure love of Christ, then be happy and optimistic yourself.&nbsp; Learn as much as you can by study and by faith.&nbsp; Be obedient, modest and chaste, and seek to have the Spirit with you always. &nbsp;You will then attract and be attracted to those who are obedient and who have the Spirit with them. &nbsp;And you will recognize those who aren&#39;t and who don&#39;t. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I first met Sister Clark, I knew she was close to the Lord. &nbsp;I recognized the light in her eyes and the virtue in her heart. &nbsp;It was inspiring to be with her. &nbsp;In those long ago days, I experienced exactly what President Benson once counseled: 
</p>
<p>
	One good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this: in her [or his] presence, do you think your noblest thoughts, do you aspire to your finest deeds, do you wish you were better than you are?<sup><a href="#28." target="_self" target="_self">28 </a></sup>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/12_5.jpg" border="0" alt="Kim and Sue Clark" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I am so grateful that she loved me then and loves me now.&nbsp; She is in every sense my eternal companion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Savior&#39;s mortal ministry was relatively short, but He used almost every moment to serve others. &nbsp;Everywhere He went, He healed, blessed, taught, and lifted people up. &nbsp;His service was an expression of His pure and perfect love. &nbsp;For the Savior, love was and is an active verb.&nbsp; He loved perfectly by serving perfectly. &nbsp;He has called us to be His true followers, to love as He loves, by serving as He serves: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<sup><a href="#29." target="_self" target="_self">29</a> </sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.<sup><a href="#30._" target="_self" target="_self">30</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
Here, again, the mothers and fathers of the army of Helaman have set a pattern for us. They felt the Savior&#39;s redeeming love, and they felt His call to serve. &nbsp;In the covenant they made, they sought to give to others as He had given to them-life, hope, strength, and support. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Becoming Christ-like in our service that we may be blessed with Christ-like love is essential to our quest for eternal life. &nbsp;At milestone #2, for example, we create an eternal marriage by serving our eternal companion in just this way. 
</p>
<p>
Of service in eternal marriage, the scriptures teach: 
</p>
<p>
	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;<sup><a href="#31." target="_self" target="_self">31 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.<sup><a href="#32." target="_self" target="_self">32</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
No matter whether it is helping with household tasks, or listening attentively, or giving a blessing, or expressing love, or supporting one another in a thousand different ways, Christ-like service disciplines, deepens, and strengthens the love of husband and wife.&nbsp; They become one as they serve each other and are blessed to love as Christ loves. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Sue and I have been married almost 38 years. &nbsp;In that time I have experienced the power of service in strengthening our love and our marriage. &nbsp;I know that if I am attentive to her needs, the Lord will show me many ways to serve my sweetheart. &nbsp;Now, some of those ways are pretty straight forward-helping with babies, changing diapers (in the days before disposables), washing dishes, running errands, and so forth. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/16_5.jpg" border="0" alt="Kim Clark with toddler" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But I have also learned that there are little things that bring her great joy. &nbsp;One of them is taking the time and the thought to write a poem for her.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I have written many poems for Sue, but I have one today that she has never heard before.&nbsp;This morning when I got up and came into the kitchen, Sue was fixing blueberry pancakes, which I love.&nbsp; The light was streaming through the window in the kitchen, and it was glorious.&nbsp; So I penned this little poem for her: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountains glistening in the sun 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daylight through the windows streaming, 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blueberry pancakes on the griddle 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sue loves me, and I&#39;m not dreaming. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In these small and simple ways, I love and serve her. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There is an important spiritual dimension to love and service. &nbsp;When we choose to serve one another in marriage, the Lord blesses us to listen better, observe more effectively, and come to know how to really help the one we love so much. &nbsp;Service that is guided and blessed by the Holy Ghost binds husband and wife together in bonds of charity, the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; They truly cleave unto each other and to none else-no other person, no other thing. &nbsp;Their love becomes eternal, and they become one. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ gave His life for us. &nbsp;His atoning sacrifice is the fullest expression of His pure love for His Father and for us: 
</p>
<p>
	But . . . I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.<sup><a href="#33." target="_self" target="_self">33</a> </sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<sup><a href="#34." target="_self" target="_self">34 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The fathers and mothers of the army of Helaman were blessed with that love. &nbsp;Together they made a sacred covenant to never take up arms and to change their whole society.&nbsp; They brought to the Lord a sacrifice of their broken hearts and their contrite spirits. &nbsp;And then, because of their great love for the Savior, for each other, for their children, and for their brothers and sisters, they were willing to suffer and die rather than break that covenant. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
True followers of Christ are followers who have been tried and tested, whose faith has been proved in sacrifice. &nbsp;President Benson taught this principle: 
</p>
<p>
	Sacrifice is truly the crowning test of the gospel. &nbsp;Men are tried and tested in this mortal probation to see if they will put first in their lives the kingdom of God. (See Matt. 6:33) To gain eternal life, they must be willing, if called upon, to sacrifice all things for the gospel.<a href="#35." target="_self" target="_self"><sup>35</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
Sacrifice is thus critical to our quest for eternal life. &nbsp;Nowhere is this more evident than at milestone #3: building up a righteous posterity. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There is great joy in being a mother and a father, but there is also sacrifice.&nbsp; Think of what it takes to bring a child into the world. A mother who carries a child for nine months and then gives birth sacrifices her physical well-being, energy, participation in other activities, and much else to give that child life.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Think what it takes to lead a family in righteousness. &nbsp;A father who stands with his wife at the head of the family must focus time, energy, and attention on planning, organizing, and directing family prayer, scripture study, family home evening, family work projects, and family recreation activities. &nbsp;That means he must sacrifice rewards from work, sports, hobbies, and friends that would draw him away from leading the family program. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Think about the many things mothers and fathers do when they nurture children: taking care of a baby in the middle of the night, giving baths, reading stories, teaching a little child how to work, setting boundaries, teaching a teenager how to drive, setting curfew, waiting for teenagers to come home, and much else.&nbsp; Nurturing requires parents to sacrifice time, resources, and energy. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Here is an example from our own experience. &nbsp;When our twins were born, they were children numbers six and seven.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/20%20a.jpg" border="0" alt="Kim Clark with twin daughters" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We had hired a contractor to add bedrooms to our house.&nbsp; The plan was for the bedrooms to be done before the twins were born.&nbsp; Well, the twins arrived on time in September, but the new bedrooms weren&#39;t finished until the following February.&nbsp; We lived in the middle of a construction project with two brand new babies. &nbsp;We put the two baby girls in a tiny bedroom just big enough for two cribs and a place on the floor for Sue and me to sit while we fed the babies in the middle of every night. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/20%20b.jpg" border="0" alt="house remodel" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In that experience and many others, Sue and I learned that when parents bring to the Lord the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, He blesses them. 
</p>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;<img src="images/090421_clark/21%20a.jpg" border="0" alt="family" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When they act with faith in Christ to sacrifice for their children, the Lord blesses parents with strength and spiritual gifts, including His pure and perfect love.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/21%20b.jpg" border="0" alt="family in prayer" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Because they sacrifice in faith, parents can teach, guide, and nurture their children with Christ-like love. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/090421_clark/21%20c.jpg" border="0" alt="father and child playing" width="323" height="215" />
</p>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The children are not only sealed to their parents forever, but those sacred bonds of love grow and strengthen because the Savior sanctifies the sacrifice of faithful parents. 
</p>

&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My dear brothers and sisters, I have talked today of three principles to guide you on your quest to find and become an eternal companion, create an eternal marriage, and build up a righteous posterity: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, I invite Sue to join me at the pulpit.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Sister Clark and I stand before you today as living witnesses that these principles are true.&nbsp; God our Father lives! &nbsp;Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah. &nbsp;In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, there are holy temples and sealing power and the supernal blessings of eternal marriage and eternal families.&nbsp; We know these things are true.&nbsp; And we know there is nothing, not anything, more important than salvation and redemption and eternal life with our Heavenly Father through the mercy and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We leave you with our testimonies and this promise: &nbsp;If you will come unto Christ and truly follow Him in these sacred principles, you will be filled with His pure and perfect love.&nbsp; You will be a worthy eternal companion, a faithful husband or wife, a righteous mother or father in an eternal family, crowned with glory and power and exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God. &nbsp;This is your promise.&nbsp; This is your destiny. &nbsp;In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen. 
</p>

The mission of BYU-Idaho is to help you become disciples of Jesus Christ while you prepare to become leaders in your families, at Church, and in your careers.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Jesus Christ taught that the pathway of discipleship requires much more than just believing in Him. &nbsp;He said: 
</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are they who shall believe in [me] and come down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they shall receive a remission of their sins.<sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;Then using what we refer to as &quot;The Beatitudes,&quot; He taught how we are to do that.&nbsp; He said: 
</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are the poor in spirit . . . 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are . . . they that mourn . . . &nbsp; 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are the meek . . . 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	&nbsp;. . . blessed are . . . they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost. 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are the merciful . . . 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are . . . the pure in heart . . . &nbsp; 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . blessed are . . . the peacemakers, . . . 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	And blessed are . . . they who are persecuted for my name&#39;s sake . . . &nbsp; 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	For [they] shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for great shall be [their] reward in heaven . . 
	<a name=".2">.<sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p align="left">
I like to think of the first four attributes listed here as attributes that prepare us for receiving the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Being poor in spirit, we come to Christ mourning that we lack what He has to offer.&nbsp; In meekness, we hunger and thirst for it and are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
And then with the gifts we receive through the ministry of the Holy Ghost, we become merciful.&nbsp; Loving with a pure heart, we become peacemakers and defenders of the kingdom not backing down when reviled and persecuted. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
With all of this Our Savior gives us an assignment and a caution.&nbsp; Here is the assignment: 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . I give unto you to be the salt of the earth . . .&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . [and] the light of this people.<sup><a href="#3._">3 
</a> </sup>
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Here is the caution: 
</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be salted? <br />
	. . . do men light a candle and put it under a bushel?&nbsp; Nay, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house;&nbsp;
	</p>
<p align="left">
	Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.<a href="#4."><sup>4</sup>
</a>
</p>
<p align="left">
With this in mind, we come to devotional with our candles on a candlestick sharing our light with one another.&nbsp; If we come meekly, the ministry of the Holy Ghost will inspire us and we will be renewed in our covenant to bear one another&#39;s burdens, to comfort those in need, and to stand as witnesses of God.&nbsp; We will leave and serve Him and keep His commandments.<sup><a href="#5._">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Come every week and bring those around you who might think they are too tired or too busy.&nbsp; Hold your candlestick high, and light the way to devotional for them. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Now, President Clark has prepared a wonderful message for you today.&nbsp; I pray that you will listen with the Spirit and receive personal guidance for your lives. 
</p>

&nbsp;
</p>

I testify that Heavenly Father loves you and desires to bless you in this way.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

It is indeed an honor to be invited to speak at a BYU-Idaho Devotional. I express our deep appreciation to President and Sister Clark and President Bruce Hobbs, the Director of University Relations for giving Sister Kinghorn and me the opportunity to return to campus and be a part of today&#39;s program. It is a blessing to be able to look out across a sea of faces representative of the many, many BYUI students who willingly come daily to the temple to give of your time and your love to sacrifice for the eternal blessings of those of the unseen world who benefit so greatly from your selfless service &mdash; and, on their behalf to say thank you. You truly are wonderful. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For 23 years I sat here on this stage every week during the devotional assemblies. I had a part in the arranging for each of the devotionals. I have been taught much from this pulpit by many, many wonderful speakers that has impacted my life for good. Before and after these devotionals I had, over the years, the opportunity to either pick up many of the devotional speakers at the Idaho Falls Airport or to take them back there for their return flight home. During those wonderful rides I received even more of the spirit and testimony of those who have stood at this pulpit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Many from whom I learned much, were not General Authorities, but were members of our own faculty and administration, or people from local or nearby areas. Not as well known, perhaps, but people with powerful testimonies and with messages to share that touched not just me, but all those within the devotional audience. I stand on the shoulders of these great speakers who have shared from their souls their teachings that, in many instances, have literally changed lives. My wife and I are humbled to be included with such spiritual giants. It is my hope that what we share with you today may be of worth and will motivate your lives for good. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, and as a way to introduce my message to you, may I share from an article I read last Fall in the <em>Church News</em>. The date was September 20, 2008. The article was concerning a news report on the Salt Lake City North Stake Conference broadcast. The article quoted Elder Richard G. Hinckley of the Quorum of the Seventy, the son of our late prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. In his address Elder Hinckley expressed: 
</p>
<p>
	...[I have] a renewed sense of awe and wonder for the keys that [the Lord] has restored in this dispensation, and, even more specifically, for the keys and authority made manifest in the ordinances of the temple.&nbsp;(Elder Richard G. Hinckley) 
	</p>
<p>
Then Elder Hinckley made reference to an experience that had happened a little over a year earlier when members of his family were in the Salt Lake Temple for the sealing of his sister&#39;s youngest daughter, the 24<sup>th</sup> of President Hinckley&#39;s 25 grandchildren to be married. Elder Hinckley commented on how this was the last sealing his father performed in mortality. Then Elder Hinckley told of how his father had made a few informal remarks before the beginning of the actual sealing ordinance. He told of how President Hinckley&#39;s comments were unrehearsed and spontaneous; how he talked for a minute of two, and how he then paused and looked around the sealing room which was filled with family and a few friends of the bride and groom and then said something that struck Elder Hinckley with a powerful force:

<p>
	President Hinckley, speaking quietly, almost as though speaking to himself, said, &quot;It has occurred to me that I have sealed all five of my children and 24 of my married grandchildren in this temple.&quot; Then he paused for a moment or two and concluded with this remarkable statement, &quot;I think that is the <em>finest </em>thing I have ever done&quot;&nbsp;(President Gordon B. Hinckley). 
	</p>
<p>
Elder Hinckley then was quoted as saying, &quot;I thought of his 97 years, and of the tremendous, untiring efforts he had made to bring the kingdom forward in the earth, yet when all was said and done, just eight months before the end of his long and productive life, in the quiet privacy of that sealing room, he reflected that the <em>finest </em>thing he had ever done was to bind his family&nbsp;&mdash; his posterity &mdash;together for eternity.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, that little snippet from the life of our dearly beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley has caused me deep reflection as well. First I tried to think of&nbsp;<em>all</em> that President Hinckley did during his 97 years of life, his almost 50 years as a General Authority, and his almost 13 years as the President of the Church. The list is impressive, but let me highlight a few of the monumental accomplishments that will forever be associated with him: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Hinckley will forever be remembered for all these things, yet, in his own words, the <em>&quot;finest&quot;</em> thing he ever did was the sealing of his five children and 24 of his 25 grandchildren.&nbsp;It is what makes these sealings his <em>finest </em>accomplishment that I want to speak about today. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Twice in my life I have had the privilege of serving as a bishop in the church &mdash; once in my home ward and once here on campus. During those years I performed several marriages for members of my respective wards. Each time the couple did its best to plan as nice a wedding as possible under those circumstances. I performed weddings in our ward Relief Society room; in the member&#39;s home, in my home, in a member&#39;s back yard, and once on the banks of the Snake River by a motel across from the Idaho Falls Temple. In each case, there was music and refreshments, best wishes and pictures, a best man and a maid or matron of honor. In some of these weddings rice was thrown and a couple of times tin cans were tied to the back of the couple&#39;s car. Each time the <em>Wedding March</em> was played and in some cases, it was as good as the weddings we see portrayed in Hollywood. Truthfully, I have to say that in most instances the guests were not &quot;over dressed&quot; for the occasion and, a few of the times, neither were the bride or groom. But, in all cases, the wedding was performed according to the laws of the land, by one having authority &mdash; me &mdash; and in each case the wedding carried with it the maximum duration allowed &mdash; even &quot;until death do they part.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But, my dear young brothers and sisters, I cannot say &mdash; nor even remotely so &mdash; that these were the &quot;finest&quot; things I ever did. In fact, in every case, it wasn&#39;t what I wished could have happened for these young couples. I ached for them and, in some instances, for their parents because I knew it was not what the they had wanted for their son or their daughter either. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A little over a year ago, however, a very significant and wonderful thing happened when President Thomas S. Monson and Elder Russell M. Nelson came to Rexburg to dedicate this magnificent new temple that stands above us on the Rexburg hill. They brought with them, not only their graciousness and spirituality, they brought with them the sealing power &mdash; even the power to bind on earth and bind in heaven &mdash; and that power was given to several sealers to perform marriages in the Rexburg Temple that could last <em>for time and for all eternity</em> and I was privileged to be one of those who received this sealing power through the authorization of President Thomas S. Monson and under the hands of Elder Russell M. Nelson.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Since that time it has now been my privilege to have personally performed 40 or so of the 500 plus marriages that have been performed in the sealing rooms of the Rexburg Temple. Two of those I performed last Saturday. And, my young brothers and sisters, I believe I now know a little more about why President Hinckley said what he said when he performed his last sealing as reported by his son, Elder Richard G. Hinckley. May I assure you that such sealings in such temples are the ultimate ordinances performed here on earth. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you why I believe President Hinckley felt this way. In his book <em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, President Joseph Fielding Smith, the great scriptorian of latter day prophets, says this: 
</p>
<p>
	There is no ordinance connected with the gospel of Jesus Christ of greater importance, of more solemn and sacred nature, and more necessary to the eternal joy of man, than marriage. If properly received, [in a temple of the Lord] this covenant becomes the means of the greatest happiness. The greatest honors of this life, and in the life to come 
	&#8212; honor, dominion, and power in perfect love &#8212; are the blessings which come because of it. [A temple] marriage is the grandest, most glorious, and near exalting principle connected with the gospel. (President Joseph Fielding Smith) 
	</p>
<p>
In essence, President Joseph Fielding Smith felt that marriage in the temple brings the crowning blessings of the gospel to each man and woman who kneels at the alter and is sealed for time and for all eternity by one holding the sealing powers of the Priesthood. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But the blessings of the sealing power of the temple aren&#39;t just limited to a man and his wife. The family is also sealed together for time and for all eternity. Each child born in the covenant or sealed in the temple is sealed to their parents forever. In his great vision of the spirit world, President Joseph F. Smith related: 
</p>
<p>
	The Prophet Elijah was to plant in the hearts of the children the promises 
	made to the fathers, Foreshadowing the great work to be done in the temples 
	of the Lord in the dispensation of the fulness of times, for the redemption of the dead, and the sealing of the children to their parents,...&nbsp;(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 138:47-48) 
	</p>
<p>
What an added blessing. What an added reason for President Hinckley to feel that the &quot;finest&quot; thing he ever did was to perform the sealings of his children and grandchildren. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Can you married students in the audience imagine not having those special little ones who have blessed your lives so powerfully, not be yours in the life to come? Those of you who attended the open house of the Rexburg Temple last year might remember the short introductory film that was shown to all prior to beginning the actual temple tour. In it Elder Jeffrey R. Holland commented on the concept of heaven relative to his family. &quot;Heaven,&quot; he said, &quot;Heaven, just wouldn&#39;t be heaven without my wife, and my children.&quot;&nbsp;(Elder Jeffrey R. Holland) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And it wouldn't be, would it? Having your family with you forever adds new 
meaning to what was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith when the Lord told him,&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	And that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy. (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 130:2) 
	</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, many of us have wonderful relationships with our parents and our siblings. Some maybe not so good, but all of us have that dream of a wonderful family life. We look forward to loving and enjoying our children. And yet, in the next life that relationship can and will be far beyond anything we can imagine here.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In addition to having been privileged to perform the marriages of almost 40 couples in the Rexburg Temple, I have also had the opportunity to seal several couples who were married earlier in a civil ceremony. In some of those cases I also had the opportunity to seal their children to them. Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that I can think of nothing more beautiful than to see the tears streaming down the cheeks of a husband and a wife &mdash; a father and a mother&nbsp;&mdash; after they have now been sealed together with the same authority and the same blessings as those being married for the first time, to see their little ones brought in. These beautiful little children dressed in white who are then sealed to their parents, the same as if they had been born in the covenant. May I assure you, there is nothing more beautiful and meaningful. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
But there are things that have been revealed through latter-day prophets that we also need to ponder about those marriages that&nbsp;<em>are not</em>&nbsp;sealed in the temple. The Lord said to the Prophet Joseph, 
</p>
<p>
	And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant [of marriage,] it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God. And verily I say unto you, that the conditions, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into [in the 
	temple] and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed...are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.&nbsp;(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132:6-7) 
	</p>
<p>
Contrast that to revealed words given to the Prophet Joseph about those marriages that&nbsp;<em>are</em> sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise by one holding the sealing power in the House of the Lord: 
</p>
<p>
	And again verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant [in my temple], and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood;...it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them. 
	</p>
<p>
	(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132:19-20) 
	</p>
<p>
Now do you begin to catch a little glimpse of why President Hinckley shared his feelings that this sealing of his children and grandchildren in the sealing room of the Salt Lake Temple was the <em>finest</em> thing he had ever done? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
My dear sisters, those of you not yet married, can you envision yourself kneeling across the alter someday from your perceived most handsome, most thoughtful, most understanding, most spiritual man &mdash; one worthy to take you to the temple? My dear brethren, those of you not yet married, can you envision yourself kneeling across the alter from your perceived most beautiful, most exciting, most pure woman &mdash; one whose feelings about the temple are the same as yours? My dear brothers and sisters, those of you who are already married, who already know of what I am speaking, have you already or can you yet envision someday holding the most beautiful, the most perfect little spirit in your arms that was ever created and knowing that he or she is yours for all eternity? All of you, then, when that someday comes will know why your temple sealing was worth waiting for and why it was truly the <em>&quot;finest&quot;</em> thing you ever did. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Brothers and Sister, in closing I&#39;d like to remind you of the story told by Sister Kinghorn today about her Grandfather&#39;s experience of traveling through Las Vegas, Nevada, where he vowed that he would not knowingly enter into Satan&#39;s backyard. May you know that if you make that same vow in all that you do, then your temple worthiness, your temple desire and your temple covenants will keep him out of your backyard so that the &quot;<em>finest</em><strong>&quot;</strong> of all mortal experiences, the blessings of the sealing powers in the Lord&#39;s temple for time and for all eternity, can be yours. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the dedicatory prayer offered at the new Draper Temple last month, President Thomas S. Monson asked the Lord to bless you, our youth of today and our hope of tomorrow. He said, 
</p>
<p>
	In a time of departure from safe moorings, may youth of the noble birthright carry on in the traditions of their parents and grandparents. They are subjected to the sophistries of Satan. Help such youth to stand firm for truth and righteousness. Open wide to their view the gates of learning, of understanding, of service in Thy kingdom.&nbsp;Bless them with a lengthened view of their eternal possibilities. (President Thomas S. Monson, Draper Temple Dedicatory Prayer) 
	</p>
<p>
I bear testimony that an understanding of the sealing powers of the new and everlasting covenant of marriage provides this lengthened view of your eternal possibilities. I bear testimony that President Gordon B. Hinckley, a prophet of God, was truly inspired to declare what he knew to be true about insuring your temple sealing to be the <em>finest </em>thing you could ever do. May it truly be so, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

President Clark, Brother and Sisters, we have been looking forward to this day, and this opportunity to be with all of you. It is a special honor and privilege to have been invited to be a participant in this devotional, although it is a humbling assignment.&nbsp; We have enjoyed a tour of your beautiful campus, and felt the spirit of this great university. I must pass along to you the comments of my husband after he attended General Priesthood meeting where the music was presented by the Men&#39;s Chorus.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; &quot;They were amazing, unbelievable,&nbsp;as good as the Tabernacle Choir!&quot;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We were also excited to see the Rexburg Temple for the first time. We drove in to town last night and were up early this morning in time to catch an endowment session before we came to the campus. It is a gorgeous temple, and I was thinking about you, and the 
</p>
<p>
opportunity you have to visit the temple often and add a spiritual dimension to your education. When I think of this, a flood of memories comes back to us from Nauvoo. The first two years that we were there, students from BYU came for a semester of study at the Joseph Smith Academy right across the street from the temple. About one hundred students came during Fall and Winter semesters. It was a unique opportunity for the students to learn about the restoration and the Prophet Joseph Smith, and particularly the Nauvoo period, while living where it happened. Some of you may have participated in that program. It was amazing to watch the transformation that came over those students in the few weeks they were there. The first thing we noticed was that whenever the students were not in class, they were in the temple. The baptistery was never busier and our workers loved it, they could not quit talking about the students. One day a few of them came into my office and gave me a picture of their class and a Nauvoo brick with 14,836 baptisms etched into the brick. Before they left, the students had completed over 15,000 baptisms, and that seemed to be typical of all the groups that came. To some, it would seem a little unusual, that college students would spend all their free time in the temple. But they loved to be there, they loved the spirit they felt, and they knew they were doing something important. There is a unique and beautiful spirit in the Nauvoo Temple. It was like a spiritual magnet drawing the students in. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Today I would like to share with you some experiences I have had while serving in various Church assignments that have opened my eyes to the power of the Holy Ghost as a guiding influence our lives personally and as the Lord&#39;s agent in bringing about the Kingdom of God on the earth. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On the occasion of the Last Supper, the Lord taught in beautiful symbolism the principles that he had been teaching and living throughout his ministry. It was a time of deep sorrow as the reality of His departure descended upon his apostles: Listen to His comforting words: 
</p>
<p>
	I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Even the spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him, but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;I will not leave you comfortless, I will come unto you. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.&quot; (John 14:16-18,26) 
	</p>
<p>
Because He could not remain with them, the Savior was leaving them a gift, the Gift of the Holy Ghost as the way that He could be with them. In His tender mercy, that promise is extended to all who are baptized by priesthood authority in His holy name. We are taught about the Holy Ghost from the time we are in Primary, but to internalize the truth of that promise, we have to experience it. Think about those special moments when the spirit has left an impression, testified of truth to your heart, prompted you in answer to a prayer or been a source of comfort. We cannot explain these impressions, but neither can we deny them. And when we acknowledge them, they become an anchor to our faith, and we see the reality of the Savior&#39;s promise. Someone once said: &quot;The voyage of discovery lies not in finding new landscapes, but in having new eyes.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1989 Brother Wirthlin was called to preside over the Germany, Frankfurt Mission. The three years that we were there turned into a unique time in the history of Germany.&nbsp;It had been a divided country since World War II with East Germany under Communist rule and West Germany under a democratic government.&nbsp;The Berlin Wall divided the two sectors. Who could have predicted that as the wheels of history turned, in one year, with no blood shed, East Germany would be freed from Communist rule, and the country would become a united free people.&nbsp;It all began in September of 1989 with student demonstrations for freedom in Leipsig, East Germany. Prime Minister Honeker asked Premier Gorbechev of the Soviet Union for support in putting down the demonstrations.&nbsp;The answer came back &quot;no&quot;.&nbsp;The students began walking down through Czechoslovakia, into Austria and into West Germany.&nbsp;This became the prelude to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.&nbsp;With the barriers down, refugees began pouring into West Germany from Eastern Europe and Africa.&nbsp;When Elder Nelson combined the East and West Berlin stakes, he said, &quot;Germany will become the seeding ground for the church in Eastern Europe.&quot;&nbsp;And that&#39;s exactly what happened.&nbsp;Missions opened up in East Germany, Russia, Bulgaria and Albania. The number of missions in Germany grew from three when we arrived to six when we were released.&nbsp;The final miracle event occurred the third year of our mission when the entire Soviet Union dissolved. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;

<p>
Some would say that history turns on the fulcrum of political events, but we know better, history turns on the timetable of the Lord. It was clear, the time had come for the light of the gospel to be taken to a people who had lived for so many years in spiritual darkness. Daniel prophesied of the day when the gospel would fill the earth in his interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s dream. A stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that smote the image of the kingdoms of the earth, and it became a great mountain that filled the whole earth and would stand forever. (Daniel 2: 34,35,44) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We sent the first missionaries from Frankfurt into Bulgaria and Albania. I remember how anxious those two Elders and two Sisters were to go into those countries without the language and no established church to receive them. But the Lord had opened the door and they were prepared because they had the Holy Ghost, even the Spirit of Truth with them. One day I was reading the Parable of the Tame and Wild Olive Tree as recorded in Jacob 5. I realized that we were seeing the fulfillment of another prophesy. The parable tells the story of the gathering of Israel in the latter days. The Lord of the vineyard visited the vineyard 4 times, and on the last visit, he said to His servants: 
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;. . . Go to, and labor in the vineyard with your might. For behold this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard. For the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me, ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come. 
	</p>
<p>
	And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their might; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things. (Jacob 5:71-72) 
	</p>
<p>
What an eye opener that was for me; we were seeing it happen. Through the power of the Spirit, the Lord was moving people and nations so that the kingdom of God could roll forth in the earth. As Paul said: 
</p>
<p>
	He hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation. (Acts 17:26) 
	</p>
<p>
The Holy Ghost is the Lord&#39;s agent in preparing those throughout the world who are to be the key players in bringing about His work. The power of the Spirit to turn hearts to Christ was profoundly impressed upon us during the two years President Wirthlin presided over Missionary Training Center in Provo. I had the opportunity to invite missionaries who were converts to the church into my office, and they would relate their conversion story. Many came from the United States, but they also came from countries as far away as Romania, Russia, Korea, Japan and Australia.  Most had walked the pathway of conversion alone without the support of their family. The decision to serve a mission meant leaving their family and friends, setting aside school, dating and all those normal involvements of a young person at that point in his or her life. I invited some of them to share their story and testimony in our Mission Conferences and Firesides. As different as all their stories were, there was one common denominator - they all had felt the testifying power of the Spirit and once they had become converted, their great desire was to give back to the Lord and to bring into someone else&#39;s life the joy the gospel had brought to them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Each Wednesday, we welcomed between 400 and 600 new missionaries. On the following Sunday evening, we invited the new missionaries to come into one of the large chapels for an evening with the president. Microphones were placed throughout the group. President Wirthlin asked the missionaries a question: How have you changed in the past 4 days since you entered the MTC. I expected them to say, &quot;Give me a break, I&#39;m exhausted.&quot; &quot; I&#39;m still trying to find my way around the campus.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t sit for 8 hours a day in class.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t like my companion.&quot; But that was not what I heard. I was so taken back by what I did hear, that I wrote down their responses: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I have learned the power of personal prayer. Before I came to the MTC, I prayed only at night, now I pray all the time.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;My love for the Savior and my testimony have grown in a huge way.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I have been active all my life, but I have never been so touched by the spirit.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I am learning Chinese, my mind is clear, I can&#39;t believe how much I&#39;m learning.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;My life has always been about me, and now I put my companions success ahead of my own. &quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I have been amazed at the love I feel. I have never felt such brotherhood.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I have felt an increase in my capacity for knowledge. It is like a waterfall pouring upon us and we&#39;re absorbing it all.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Through the power of the Spirit, a miracle change had come over the missionaries in just 4 days. It is reminiscent of King Benjamin&#39;s counsel to his people to &lsquo; yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and put off the natural man [and woman] . . . and become as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love&#39;. (Mosiah 3:19) As the missionaries yielded to the Spirit, they forgot themselves and they found they were magnified in their abilities to love and to learn and to feel a closeness to the Savior. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
After the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young had a vision where he talked with Joseph in the spirit. In his account of that experience, he said: 
</p>
<p>
	Joseph stepped toward me and looking very earnestly said: Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful not to turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the Kingdom. Tell the brethren and sisters to keep their hearts open to conviction so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it. . . It will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice and hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God. . . (Oscar W. McConkie, <em>Angels</em>, [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975] p. 120) 
	</p>
<p>
Wilford Woodruff said: &quot;If you have the Holy Ghost with you, I can say unto you that there is no greater gift, there is no greater blessing, there is no greater testimony given to any man on earth. . .&quot; (<em>Doctrines from the Prophets</em>, Alma P. Burton, comp. [Salt Lake City; Book craft, 1970] p. 229 
</p>
<p>

<p>
When Brother Wirthlin was released as President of the Nauvoo Temple, our adjustment back to the real world was more of shock than we had expected. For over three years we had been insulated from the noise, the confusion, and turmoil, and the ever increasing presence of evil in the world. In the temple, we had been immersed in the Spirit and focused on things of the spirit, and so it was hard to leave our temple assignment. I remember when it was time for the missionaries to leave the MTC and go out into their field of labor, there was some ambivalence, some longing to stay. I also remember in our Frankfurt Mission, how difficult it was for the departing missionaries to return home. Once you have felt the sweetness of the Spirit on a daily basis, it&#39;s hard to go back to the real world. But that is where we all are. You and I are not temple workers or full-time missionaries. It means that, by our own desire, we must find ways to invite the spirit into our lives if we want to enjoy the blessings. 
</p>
<p>

<p>
I&#39;d like to share an experience with you that our family went through several years ago that has been a visual symbol to me of the importance of having the Spirit in my life. We were on vacation at Lake Powell with our children, some extended family and my parents. This was one of our first trips to Lake Powell with our family. We launched our boat at Bullfrog one morning and spent the day traveling down the channel towards Rainbow Bridge, which is 50 miles away. We stayed there for most of the day. Towards evening, we started back toward the Marina at Bullfrog. We had gone a few miles when the steering mechanism on our boat broke, and we found ourselves stranded in the middle of the lake with no way to steer the boat.&nbsp; Lake Powell can be a formidable place when you are in trouble, it was beginning to get dark, and we were all very aware of the danger of our plight. I can tell you there was a prayer in every heart.&nbsp; We had two choices, we could spend the night on the lake since there was no beach nearby, or we could hope that another boat would come by and get help for us. We looked around us for another boat,&nbsp;and sure enough, in the distance, we saw a boat headed our way. As it drew near, we waved our red flag and beckoned the driver over. Once they were close enough to discern faces, to our complete surprise, shock, and joy, we found the family in the boat to be friends of my parents - one of those happenings that could never be a coincidence.&nbsp;To add to our good fortune, their boat was bigger than ours, and they had a tow rope and a powerful spotlight. &nbsp;We tied our boat to theirs and began the long night&#39;s journey back to the marina. We were 35 miles away from Bullfrog and our towing speed was 7 miles per hour. There was no moon and it was really dark. If you know Lake Powell, you realize you can easily get&nbsp;out of the main channel and lost in daylight if you don&#39;t know where you are going. The channel is marked with buoys that are one mile apart, and at the top of each buoy is a small reflector. We took turns sitting on the bow of the lead boat, searchlight in hand, looking for the next buoy. When the light would catch the reflector, we would head to that buoy and then begin searching for the next reflector. One mile after another for 35 miles we searched for each reflector. Once we found it, we held on to it as if our very life depended on it. We finally arrived at Bullfrog at 1:00 a.m., very grateful for good friends who were guided to us and a light that brought us home. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our journey through mortality is not unlike that harrowing journey we experienced on Lake Powell. In order to reach our destination, we had to stay in the main channel. It was dark, easy to become confused and get off course. Only the light on the reflector kept us in the channel. Jesus said to his disciples: 
</p>
<p>
	Enter ye at the strait gate; for strait is the gate and narrow&nbsp;is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but wide is the gate and broad the way which leads to death and many there be that travel therein. . . (3 Nephi 27:33) 
	</p>
<p>
	Nephi taught: . . .The Holy Ghost showeth unto the children of men;&nbsp;the straightness of the path and the narrowness of the gate&nbsp;by which they should enter. . . (2 Nephi 31:9) 
	</p>
<p>
The light of the Holy Ghost is just as essential to our spiritual safety as that searchlight was to our physical safety. We live in a dark and murky world filled with temptations that&nbsp;are so enticing and so disguised that they are often difficult to recognize or resist. At times, it seems as though we are swimming upstream against a current of worldly trends that can seem overpowering. &nbsp;There has never been a time when the guidance, the enlightenment, and the protection of the Holy Ghost was more needful. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, we all go through low points in our lives when, for one reason or another, we feel out of touch with the Spirit. It&#39;s unsettling, even depressing and can be difficult to reverse. Before we know it, discouragement, doubt, lack of faith, lack of confidence can set in and literally can overtake us. The Lord has given us some guidelines that will help us get back in touch with the Spirit if we incorporate them into our lives. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First of all, we must follow spiritual promptings. There are times when we find ourselves in places or with people or involved in activities&nbsp;that are incompatible with the Spirit. We will feel a nudge, a prick of conscience. We must listen to and respond to those promptings.&nbsp;At other times, the Spirit will move us in a particular direction when making decisions, or will prompt us to do something to help someone. President Monson said: 
</p>
<p>
	The sweetest experience I know in life is to feel a prompting and act upon it and later find out it was the fulfillment of someone&#39;s prayer or someone&#39;s need. And I always want the Lord to know that if he needs an errand run, Tom Monson will run that errand for him. 
	</p>
<p>
Second: We can invite the Spirit into our lives through personal prayer. The Lord said: &quot;Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing - yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth. . .&quot; (D&amp;C 19:38). We can always have a prayer in our heart. Prayer is the most powerful way we can overcome the influence of Satan. It is our lifeline to our Father in Heaven and a sure way to open our hearts to receive His counsel and direction through the Spirit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Third: We invite the Spirit into our lives by prayerfully reading and pondering the scriptures. In Nephi&#39;s interpretation of the vision of the tree of life and the meaning of the rod of iron, he said: &quot;. . . that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.&quot; (I Nephi 15:24) One of the defining characteristics of our world today is deception. The standard for what is right and what is wrong has become so distorted that there is no standard. Aren&#39;t we all susceptible to these deceptions. Fifteen minutes with the scriptures in the morning can fortify us with the Spirit. As I have read the Book of Mormon this last time, read about secret combinations, and deceptions, about families in crisis, I find myself seeing images from our world today.&nbsp;Alma referred to this by saying these things are not without a &quot;type and a shadow.&quot; (Alma 37: 43,45) They are teachings for our day and time if we have eyes to see their relevance. The Holy Ghost can give us that insight. Remember the words of Moroni: &quot;By the power of the Holy Ghost, ye may know the truth of all things.&quot; (Moroni 10:5) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Finally, we must realize the power of the temple to invite the Spirit into our lives. When we step in the door of the temple, we leave the world and all it&#39;s distractions behind us and turn our thoughts and attitude to things of eternity.&nbsp;We dress in white symbolic of our worthiness to be there. There is a feeling of peace, and love and&nbsp;oneness with our Savior and our Heavenly Father that is not found anywhere else on earth. Through the Spirit, we see the problems&nbsp;of our lives in an eternal perspective. We come seeking to know the will of our Heavenly Father for us and our spirit is open to receive personal revelation. Adversity doesn&#39;t go away, and our problems are not always resolved, but we are enlightened and strengthened.&nbsp; It&#39;s as though we go to the temple empty and we leave filled with the power of the Spirit. One of my favorite scriptures is found in the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple offered by Joseph Smith:&nbsp; 
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
	And we ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go&nbsp;forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory round about them, and thine angels have charge over them. (D&amp;C 109:22) 
	</p>
<p>
I am grateful for the testimony born to me by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost that I know the things of which I have spoken today are true. I am grateful for every opportunity that has come my way for the Spirit to testify of truth. I know of the enabling power of the Spirit. I have had assignments for which I felt so inadequate that I could only go to my knees seeking the Lord&#39;s help. But through it all, I have felt close to our Heavenly Father. I know that He hears and answers our prayers. I feel His love as I draw upon the blessings of the Savior&#39;s atonement in my own life. By His grace, He enables us to do things we could never do on our own. Weak things are made strong as we come unto Him in faith.&nbsp;You are on the threshold of a marvelous future.&nbsp;The way has been prepared for you by generations who have gone before.&nbsp; And now, the Lord is depending upon you, to carry on His work. He needs you to be close to the Spirit, not only to strengthen you, but so that you can be a strength to others.&nbsp;There is a peace and happiness that comes when you are in the way of the Lord, there is a confidence and assurance that overcomes adversity. May you be blessed with the Holy Ghost to be a light and a guide in your life as you follow the path our Heavenly Father has prepared for you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

First, let me say how grateful I am to be with you today. You are blessed to have President Clark as your leader at this remarkable university. We have served in the same Quorum of Seventy for the past two years, and I have learned important lessons from the example he has set. If you watch him and listen to him, you will learn as well, because he is an exceptional learner and teacher. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That is what I would like to talk about today: learning and teaching-not just inside the walls of the church, but wherever it occurs; not just in a Sunday School class, a priesthood quorum, or a ward council, but whenever and wherever someone learns from another who teaches. And the one who teaches may not be called &quot;teacher&quot; and may not even think he or she is teaching. So I hope when I close today we will have a broader vision of what it means to teach and what it means to learn. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In a very real sense, every time we teach a truth of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we are drawing upon the love of both the Father and the Son. You will notice that I did not say, &quot;every time we <em>talk about</em> a truth of the restored gospel&quot; but &quot;every time we <em>teach</em>&quot;<em> </em>such a truth. The word <em>teach</em> implies that someone actually learned. And the word <em>learn</em> implies that the student changed in some way, that the gospel truth took root in the person and caused a change of heart-that the one who learned now does something differently as a result of the teaching. Only Christ has the power to bring about this kind of change. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While teaching General Authorities and Area Seventies prior to April general conference, Elder Bednar taught that effective gospel teaching is composed of three elements: (1) key doctrine, (2) invitation to action, and (3) promised blessings. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The key doctrine is always tied to the Heavenly Father&#39;s Plan, because the Atonement is the central doctrine upon which all other doctrines of our religion are founded (see Joseph Smith, in <em>History of the Church,</em> 3:30). The invitation to action clearly draws upon the Atonement, because an understanding of the mission of the Savior and His Atonement are invitational in nature. The Lord says, &quot;Come unto me&quot; (Matthew 11:28), &quot;Follow me&quot; (Matthew 4:19), &quot;Learn of me&quot; (Matthew 11:29). Finally, when one accepts the invitation to follow the Savior, blessings always come. And all of those blessings flow from Him. So every time we teach a truth of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ--really teach it--we are drawing upon the love of the Father and the Son. The Father loved us enough to send His only Begotten Son. The Son loved us enough to carry out the will of the Father to save His children from sin and unhappiness. The Father called the Son to save us, and the Son calls us to help bring His children home. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The call of the Father to the Son and the Son to us is an invitational call. And this type of invitation is central to teaching and learning. I want to focus today primarily on this element of teaching: an invitation to action. While presiding over the South Dakota Rapid City Mission, we asked our missionaries to memorize a statement from <em>Preach My Gospel </em>which explains that a missionary&#39;s purpose is to: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement . . . [<em>Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service </em>(2004), 1] 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The first word in that statement is <em>invite. </em>And how are missionaries encouraged to invite?<em> </em>Through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement. The more investigators come to understand the Atonement, the more they want to receive the saving ordinances of the gospel. The Lord literally calls to them. He beckons them to change. This is the invitational call of the Father and the Son. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There are many types of invitations that flow from this call. Today I would like to focus on three: (1) invitations that challenge, (2) invitations that befriend, and (3) invitations that rescue. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While President Hinckley was serving as a missionary in England, he received an invitation from his mission president to meet with a publisher who had recently released a book containing false information that could damage the Church. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At first glance, we may not view this scene from President Hinckley&#39;s mission as a gospel teaching and learning experience, but that is what it was. The mission president gave a young missionary a challenging invitation. Elder Hinckley wondered why his president would invite <em>him</em> to talk to the publisher. Why wouldn&#39;t the mission president, who was more qualified, do it himself? But he accepted the invitation and then immediately went to his apartment to pray. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Then Elder Hinckley invited the reluctant publisher to do something about the book that contained fallacious information. The publisher relented--and not only did he relent, but he was so impressed with this young missionary that every year for the rest of his life he sent President Hinckley a Christmas card. The publisher&#39;s heart had been changed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But so had Elder Hinckley&#39;s heart. By inviting him to do something challenging, his mission president had given him an opportunity to learn. It was an invitational call. Elder Hinckley accepted the invitation, went to the Lord, and was strengthened sufficiently to meet the challenge. He learned that he could do more than he thought possible with the help of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
All Church callings are invitations that flow from the Lord. After President Monson called me to serve as the general Sunday School president, I walked with Elder Nelson to his office, and he said, &quot;You are now in charge of teaching improvement for the entire Church.&quot; He explained that the leaders in the Sunday School organization are to do more than watch over Sunday School teachers. They are to help improve gospel teaching and learning wherever it occurs-in the home, in priesthood meetings, in auxiliary classes, or anywhere in the Church. It was certainly an invitation that challenged me, just as the invitation from Elder Hinckley&#39;s mission president challenged him. And the invitation drove me to my knees, just as it did young Elder Hinckley. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Invitations need not always challenge us to our limits, however. Sometimes they are much smaller challenges, but they can still cause important changes in our lives. Once, in my former assignment as an Area Seventy, I was training a new presidency of a BYU student stake. At one point in the training, I wanted to show everyone present the importance of extending invitations to others. I looked at the assistant executive secretary, a BYU student. His name was Ian. I asked him: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Is there anything in your life that you would like to do better?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Do you mean Church stuff or my everyday life?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Whichever you want.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Well, every time I go to work, I feel embarrassed that I don&#39;t know anyone&#39;s name. I&#39;ve been working at the hospital for a while, and I need to learn everybody&#39;s name.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;That&#39;s a good goal. Do you think you can do it?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Yeah, I can do it.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Would it help if you reported back to me after you learn the names?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Sure, that would help a lot.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Here&#39;s my phone number. Just send me a text when you have achieved your goal.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A week later he texted me as follows: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Ian (BYU First Stake) returning to report: I learned 11 new names last week working at the hospital (and more on the way).&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Ian knew he needed to learn the names of his co-workers, but he just needed a little nudge to do it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Some invitations challenge us to do something we know we need to do--or something we didn&#39;t know we <em>could</em> do. Other invitations are simply invitations that befriend. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When someone comes up to you and asks, &quot;Do you wanna go to the game tonight?&quot; this is an invitation that befriends, an invitation that helps people become better acquainted. As two BYU students sit together saying nothing, it is impossible to send invitations that befriend. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Who knows what these two students missed by not speaking to each other? At minimum they missed making a new friend. And none of us has too many friends.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We don&#39;t usually think of making friends as an invitation inspired by the Savior. But in a very real sense, it is. The Prophet Joseph taught that &quot;friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of &lsquo;Mormonism&#39; &quot; (in <em>History of the Church, </em>5:517). The Lord Himself said, &quot;I will call you friends, for you are my friends&quot; (D&amp;C 93:45). The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of friendship. The Lord gave Himself for us because He loves us as one friend loves another. The invitational call of the Father and the Son. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While teaching a missionary preparation course at BYU, I asked my students to get acquainted with as many new people each week as they could. They reported on their progress, just as missionaries report on key indicators. During one week, one of my students, Nathan, had conversations with 76 new people. I asked, &quot;Nathan, how did you do that?&quot; He responded, &quot;Well, I was waiting in lots of lines all week, and I would just ask the person next to me to save my place, and then I would go meet everybody else in the line. The amazing thing is that I think I made some friends that I&#39;ll have the rest of my life. I&#39;m getting together with them all the time now.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Nathan was not an extremely gregarious young man. He was by nature quiet. But he met 76 new people in a week, and some of those became close friends. He was extending an invitational call-an invitation that befriends. Now, I wish I could tell you that one of those friends became his wife, and maybe someday I will, but he is now serving his mission, so that will have to wait. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Another of my students told me that she was walking to class one afternoon and began talking to the young woman next to her on the sidewalk. Following their conversation, that young woman said, &quot;You&#39;re the only person who has talked to me at all this entire day. I don&#39;t know why you did it, but you really made me feel good.&quot; We could probably all do a little better at extending invitations that befriend. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Some invitations challenge us, some lead to more meaningful friendships, and some invitations literally rescue us from our own wrong choices or resistance to truth. These are invitations that rescue. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While serving as a mission president, I attended a lesson with two missionaries who had been teaching an older man, Brother Risty. Brother&#39;s Risty&#39;s wife was serving as the ward Relief Society president. Their grown children were all members. But Brother Risty had resisted joining the Church for 30 years. The missionaries had been teaching him every evening for several weeks, and he had attended church the Sunday before we came. But he was still not open to the idea of baptism. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As we entered the Risty home, I could tell immediately that he loved the missionaries, and they loved him. They joked with each other for a few minutes; then we sat down and had an opening prayer. Following the prayer, they had the following conversation: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>So, Brother Risty, how did you enjoy sacrament meeting? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>I liked it. The people are so good. I like the people in this ward. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>And they like you too. So what&#39;s holding you back, Brother Risty? Why haven&#39;t you joined the Church? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s because of faith. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>What about faith--you mean your faith in the Lord? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>Yeah. I look at those people when I go to church, and I think, I just don&#39;t have that kind of faith. They have so much faith! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>So what do you think you&#39;d need to do to get more faith? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>I think I&#39;d need to pray. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>But you&#39;ve prayed before, right? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>Yeah, I&#39;ve prayed before, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever expected to get an answer. I need to expect an answer when I pray. I need to have faith it can come. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>Do you think you could do that? Do you think you could pray and expect an answer? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>I think so. I think I can do that. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>When do you want to try? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Brother Risty: </strong>I can do it tonight after you two go back to your apartment. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Missionary: </strong>Brother Risty, I promise you that if you pray and expect an answer from the Lord, He will give it to you. I know that. I&#39;ve had answers to my prayers, and I know the Lord loves you and that He will give you an answer. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The missionaries returned the next evening at their regular time. Brother Risty had prayed, and he had received his answer. He was baptized a short time after that. The lesson that led to Brother Risty&#39;s decision to join the Church focused mostly on an invitation and then finally on a promised blessing. The missionaries did not need to expound on doctrine much in this lesson, because Brother Risty had been taught the doctrine for 30 years. It was the invitation and promised blessing that helped him move forward. His agency was at the center. The missionaries were not pushing him one way or another. They were simply asking him what he thought he needed to do. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I reflect on that encounter, I see the effects of God&#39;s love both on the missionaries and on Brother Risty. Brother Risty needed strengthening. He needed his confidence built so that he could receive an answer to his prayer about whether he should join the Church. And that invitation came through the missionaries. Theirs was an invitation that rescued Brother Risty from his resisting what he knew down deep he needed to do. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As President Kimball once said: &quot;God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs&quot; (Spencer W. Kimball, &quot;Small Acts of Service,&quot; <em>Ensign,</em> Dec. 1974, 4). It is through teaching--but not as we typically think of teaching. It is through extending invitations that flow from the Lord, invitations inspired by the Holy Ghost, as those dedicated missionaries did with Brother Risty. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An invitational call is not a subtle invitation. King Benjamin referred to it as &quot;the enticings of the Holy Spirit,&quot; and he taught that if we <em>yield</em> to those enticings, we will become &quot;a saint through the atonement of Christ&quot; (Mosiah 3:19). We usually think of the word <em>entice </em>in connection with temptation. And that is the way it is usually used in the scriptures. But both King Benjamin and Lehi taught that we can be <em>enticed </em>to do good as well as to do evil: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was <em>enticed </em>by the one or the other. [2 Nephi 2:16; italics added] 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When we exercise our agency, we are literally yielding ourselves to the invitation from the Lord or to the taunting of the adversary. And the more we understand the Atonement, the more enticing and irresistible the invitation to do good becomes. That is why Lehi knew that if he could only get his family to taste the fruit of the tree of life--if he could have them experience God&#39;s love--they would want to keep partaking of it forever and ever (see 1 Nephi 8:10-18). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While teaching a missionary preparation course at BYU, I asked my students to practice inviting others to come unto Christ by inviting their friends to make commitments. During one part of the course we discussed how Ammon and the other sons of Mosiah drew upon the power of the Atonement as they preached the gospel to the Lamanites. We focused particularly on Alma 26:27: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;

	Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success. 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Latin root of the word <em>comfort </em>is <em>fortis,</em> which means &quot;strong.&quot; I explained to the students that to comfort means, essentially, to strengthen. So, in this verse, Ammon testifies that the Lord strengthened him and his brethren. Even though the Lord knew that these great missionaries would be mocked, spat upon, and attacked by the Lamanites, He strengthened them and promised them a blessing: that they would succeed if they could just be patient and endure the afflictions that would surely come. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One of the students in my class described how she had taken the challenge to invite others to come unto Christ in a phone call to one of her non-LDS friends back home. When she asked how her friend was doing, her friend began to cry and said she was contemplating dropping out of college and going back home. She said she had a drinking problem, that she was drunk most of the time, and that she just felt like giving up. My student did not know, prior to calling her friend, that she was having so many problems. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My student shared Alma 26:27 with her friend. She explained that Ammon and his brothers had also become depressed about their situation and had considered giving up and returning home too, but then the Lord strengthened them. The Lord did not remove all of their obstacles, but He made them strong so they could overcome any difficulty they might face. My student invited her friend to pray about her situation and ask for strength so she could go on. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Her friend stopped crying and then said these important words: &quot;I think God sent you to me today. You&#39;ve made me want to keep going. I want to stop drinking. And I want to stay in school.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My student was teaching her friend a key doctrine of the gospel: that by listening to the promptings of the Holy Ghost, the strengthening power of Christ&#39;s Atonement can help us face problems that at first seem insurmountable. She invited her friend to action--to pray, to keep going, to never give up. And she explained the blessings that would come--God&#39;s strengthening influence--all in one very powerful telephone conversation. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The examples of the missionaries teaching Brother Risty and my student teaching her friend are both based on the invitational call of the Father and the Son, the invitation to rescue. The Lord&#39;s invitation is unique because it is an invitation we naturally want to transfer to someone else. He invites us to come to Him, so that we can invite others. His arms are always open. He is always waiting and ready. But we must do our part. We must extend His arms to those we know. As President Kimball taught, God cares for His children through us; we are the primary inviters. That is our role as members of the Church of Jesus Christ. He invites us, and we invite others. As a result, the Atonement strengthens us and the people we invite. My student, I am convinced, acted on inspiration as she spoke with her friend, and so did the missionaries. They gave what was needed at that moment for that person. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My question to each of us today is this: Is there anyone here who is receiving too many inspired invitations, invitations that help us improve? Is anyone&#39;s e-mail in-box overflowing with inspiring invitations? Is anyone&#39;s phone overloaded with text messages that invite us to come unto Christ? I don&#39;t think so. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A student, while speaking in sacrament meeting recently, said that a friend called him on a Friday afternoon and invited him to go to the temple that evening. The student said, &quot;I had set a personal goal to get to the temple more often, but things always seemed to come up, and so I wasn&#39;t going as much as I wanted. Then he called, and we both went and had a great evening.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One of our main purposes in life is to help others do what they really want to do but can&#39;t do without our help. Everyone wants to do better. But we need each other&#39;s help to accomplish our goals. I have a friend who does this naturally, almost without thinking about it. Imagine that I tell him I want to lose a little weight. The next day we&#39;re eating lunch together. I&#39;m going for the brownie with hot fudge, and he says to me, &quot;You don&#39;t want that.&quot; I keep reaching for it. He says again, &quot;You don&#39;t really want that.&quot; So with renewed self-control, my hand retreats, and I do what I really wanted to do but couldn&#39;t do without his help. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is so easy to invite. It was easy for my friend to give me a little restraint. It was easy for that student to call his friend and invite him to the temple. We can all invite others to do what they really want to do but can&#39;t do without our help. And really, it&#39;s not that they can&#39;t do it--sometimes they just need to be invited. So we invite them and help them in whatever way they wish. Moral agency always takes center stage in the invitational call of the Father and the Son, because moral agency was at the center of the Plan of Salvation. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Monson recently spoke to all General Authorities and Area Seventies about the importance of rescuing others. It was a powerful talk about the potential that everyone has to change, to improve--all we need to do is reach out to them. All we need to do is invite them in the right way, and they will come. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of his talk President Monson gave us all an invitation. He said, &quot;Ask yourselves, &lsquo;Have I rescued anyone recently?&#39; &quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A week later I was in a meeting where we discussed President Monson&#39;s talk on rescuing, and one Area Seventy related that he had always tried to visit less-active members when he presided at stake conferences. The next day I flew to Portland to conduct an auxiliary training session. I asked Elder Brinkerhoff, the Area Seventy who hosted me in that city, if we might be able to visit a less-active member following the training session. He immediately thought of a couple he had been home teaching. He said, &quot;Last Sunday they came to sacrament meeting in our ward for the first time.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We visited their home. They were a pure-hearted couple who, for some unknown reason, had become less active. The wife looked at me at one point and said, &quot;Brother Osguthorpe, you probably don&#39;t know this, but we went to sacrament meeting for the first time last week.&quot; I asked her about her impressions of the meeting. I found it important that she did not mention the messages that had been given from the pulpit; she focused on the members and their friendship. She said, &quot;I was surprised at how many friends we had in this ward even though this was our first time at sacrament meeting. So many people came up to us and were so glad to see us.&quot; Then she got tears in her eyes. &quot;I just didn&#39;t know we had so many friends.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Brinkerhoff then let them know how much it had meant to him that they had attended, and I asked the wife, &quot;So why do you think Elder Brinkerhoff cares so much?&quot; And again with tears in her eyes, she responded, &quot;Because he loves us.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Brinkerhoff had been meeting with this couple for some time. He had been extending all three types of invitations--invitations that challenge, invitations that befriend, and invitations that rescue. And the couple had finally begun to respond to the invitations. When Elder Brinkerhoff extended these invitations, perhaps it did not always look like teaching. Maybe the couple didn&#39;t always feel like he was presenting formal lessons. But in the truest sense, this was gospel teaching at its very best. They were learning key doctrines. They were responding to invitations to action. And they were experiencing the promised blessings. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This is what teaching and learning are all about in the Church of Jesus Christ. My hope is that when you are asked to teach, you will reflect on this conception of teaching and that you will give much more thought to the types of invitations that you should extend to those you teach. No one is likely receiving too many invitations that challenge, that befriend, or that rescue. We all need each of these kinds of invitations often. My prayer is that we will give more of them and respond positively to them when they come to us. I further pray that each time we give or receive such invitations, we will feel the connection of those invitations to the infinite love of our Heavenly Father and His Son, and that we will keep yielding to the enticings, the irresistible enticings of the Holy Spirit that always bring us closer to the Savior, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

An introduction like that tends to make one feel old.&nbsp; Upon hearing it my wife suggested that, actually, one of my best accomplishments was when I was a &quot;tree&quot; in her ward road show....I had no speaking lines! 
</p>

<p>
I would like to begin by expressing appreciation to the forum committee, President Broadhead, Dean Thurgood, my colleagues and good friends; all of whom have shown my sweetheart, Ann, and I great kindness this day. I have already learned a great deal simply through the process of being asked to take part in this forum and all that entails.

<p>
I hope you will enjoy our experience together today.&nbsp;I request your faith and prayers to be joined with mine, inviting the Spirit that all may be edified and find value in this hour as we discuss the topic of gambling. Since your time is as valuable as anyone else&#39;s let&#39;s jump right to the heart of today&#39;s discussion.&nbsp;I have limited our discussion today to games of chance since the majority of all gambling revenues come from this class of gaming.&nbsp;Acknowledging that there are differences between what are referred to as games of chance and games of skill, many of the same principles we discuss today will nonetheless apply to both. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;

<p>
According to National studies, more than 50% of the population plays the lottery, and more than 33% frequent casinos on a regular basis.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">1</a></u></sup> Depending on the state surveyed and public access to gambling sites, it is estimated that from 74 (Georgia) to 91% (Washington State) of the population have gambled at some time in their life.<u><sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">2</a></sup> </u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One survey reports that 84% of respondents believe casino gambling is acceptable for themselves or others.<sup>3</sup> And in a national survey, 75% of Americans who attend religious services at least once a week considered casino gaming an acceptable form of entertainment.<u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>4</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As stated by Timothy L. O&#39;Brien, in his book <em>Bad Bet,</em> &quot;Gambling is now more popular in America than baseball, the movies, and Disneyland - combined&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">5</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Given these statistics it is likely that many of you in this room today have had some experience with gambling or know someone who has. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Over the years I have used the example of gambling in my general psychology classes to summarize the principles of learning theory.&nbsp;I do this because I know of no more masterful application of psychological principles and behavioral research than that used by casinos and those involved in promoting gambling.&nbsp;As experts in employing these principles to their desired ends, certainly they qualify among those whom the Lord expressly warned us against in Section 89, verse 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants: 
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;<em>Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you.</em>
</p>
<p>
My purpose today is to uncover some of these &quot;designs&quot; by looking at the reasons people gamble and then consider the consequences of these choices.&nbsp; The following is a list of the most common reasons researchers and thousands of my students have provided for why a person might gamble: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
According to a survey conducted by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, as many as 78% (56-78%) of respondents admitted that the reason they gamble is for the money.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">6</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s look at this reason: Is it possible to make money in the short-run at games of chance? Yes it is.&nbsp; But only if two conditions hold:&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First, you have to be the lucky 1 in 135,145,920.&nbsp; Given those odds, you are more likely to be struck by lightning (1/700,000), killed by a terrorist (1/650,000), and die from flesh-eating bacteria (1/1,000,000).<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">7</a></u></sup> In other words: not very likely. Although I may have just given some of you something else to worry about! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Second, you have to stop gambling and never, ever, ever, gamble again. But what happens as soon as someone wins?&nbsp;You have seen them at the gas stations when someone wins $10 on a scratch&#39;n play game. Immediately they purchase 10 more tickets, scratch them off and throw them away. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to make money at games of chance in the long run?&nbsp; No. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To understand why, let&#39;s suppose you had a vat full of equal amounts of red, white and blue marbles. With the help of Brother Craig Johnson from the math department, I employed a random number generator to randomly draw marbles from the vat to demonstrate this principle. Suppose a white marble represented a win.&nbsp;Since you have one third of each color your odds of winning are 1:3 or a 33% probability. However, with each successive draw from the large vat your odds of pulling out multiple white marbles in a row significantly reduces with each succeeding draw such that the more times you draw; i.e. the more times you gamble, the more your pile of marbles will begin to look like the pile you are drawing from. The more times you gamble the more your wins to losses <u>have to</u> look like the system that is built into the game.&nbsp;You cannot escape it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Since you cannot make money in the long run, why then, do people continue to gamble? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Curiosity is frequently the motivation for first time players. Suppose you are on a layover at the Las Vegas airport and happen to have 4 quarters in your pocket.&nbsp;Now you shouldn&#39;t do this, but in a moment of weakness you decide to place a quarter in the slot machine and pull the handle.&nbsp;The wheels spin, lights flash, clinking sounds peal out periodically and the reels come to a rest: 7, 7, bars.&nbsp;You place another quarter: bars, bars, cherries. Your third quarter: bars, cherries, cherries.&nbsp;Of course, unbeknownst to you, these doubles are built into the system to make it look like you were just that close to a jackpot. Last quarter: bars, bars, ........bars!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Bells ring, the machine shakes, and your tray fills up with quarters. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, of course you are not going to put these newly obtained quarters back into the same machine, so you gather up your rewards and find a machine that others have been playing a while without a win. That machine will only hold so much, so it is due for a win....right?&nbsp;So off you go. You get through half of your winnings and you hit another jackpot so off you go looking for the next machine that has not recently paid out. Never mind that you have missed your connecting flight, you are making money right?&nbsp;Three hours later you are down to your last quarter. You pull the arm, the wheels spin and stop: 7, 7................bars.&nbsp;You had a bucket of quarters and now you have none.&nbsp;You look around and see a man who has been watching you feed this machine all of your quarters.&nbsp;What do you do?&nbsp;Out comes your credit card ... and you are &quot;hooked!&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As this example demonstrates, the subtlety is that people forget the machines do not keep track of your individual investments.&nbsp;They are only set up to guarantee that the overall intake exceeds the overall outgo.&nbsp;Casinos advertise returns on some of their machines to be as high as 90-95%.&nbsp;What these figures mean is that the machines are designed so that over time they will take in (that means you will lose) 5 to 10% more than the machine ever awards in a jackpot, regardless of how big the jackpot is.&nbsp;This is why casinos never lose.&nbsp;Unfortunately, and by design of the advertisement, people therefore assume they will eventually receive back 95% of their investment.&nbsp;According to a recent study,<sup><u>8</u> </sup>in actuality the average return from any machine is 60-70% and the average return for an evening of play as low as 40%.&nbsp;Why? First, because of the same reason we discussed previously: <u>players reinvest their winnings</u>. If a player continues to reinvest their 95% winnings, again at a 5% loss each time, over and over their return will eventually be zero. As we demonstrated with the marbles, the system and the odds are guaranteed; the more you play, the more your pile of marbles--that is, your win&#39;s to losses--will look like the system you are playing. Second, what most do not understand is that this 95% is a global, not individual return.&nbsp;Since every once in a while someone wins a big jackpot this means that this person received a significant portion of your 95% return which means your individual return cannot be 95%.&nbsp;So many continue to gamble expecting that promised 95% return when, in reality someone else has already taken it while the casino is taking your money to pay for it. On the other hand the <u>unfortunate</u> winner now believes that he or she <u>can</u> win more than they put in so.... <u>they continue to play; </u>looking for another win.... 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Also, as illustrated in the airport example, casinos capitalize on a social psychological principle called the gambler&#39;s fallacy which is a common error in thinking.&nbsp;Most people, gamblers included, understand that you have equal chance of winning regardless of which machine you play. After all they are all set to reward that 95% of 100% played.&nbsp;Yet, as demonstrated in our airport example when all the quarters have been placed in the machine and someone else has watched you do that; most people will now claim that the chances of winning on that particular machine are higher because it has been a long while since it has paid out. That is the gambler&#39;s fallacy.&nbsp;For example, if you had a coin and five tosses resulted in &quot;tails, heads, tails, tails, and tails, then what would you guess then next toss would be?&nbsp; Most people will say heads because there have been three tails in a row. However, the odds are still 50/50. This error in thinking contributes to the compulsive gambler&#39;s belief that after a string of losses they are now even more likely to win so they continue, sometimes with even more determination, to chase their losses by making even larger bets, convinced that a win is inevitable and a larger bet will &quot;save&quot; them when the win comes.&nbsp;The reality, of course, is that the odds are always the same regardless of what the history of the machine has been. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With technological advances, VLT&#39;s or Video Lottery Terminals--sometimes called the &quot;fast-food version of gambling&quot; or the &quot;crack cocaine of gambling&quot;--have replaced many slot machines increasing the addictive power of the gambler&#39;s fallacy.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">9</a></u></sup>&nbsp; VLT&#39;s look like slot machines, but they are networked to a central computer.&nbsp;Thus, the computer, not the individual machines, determines where, when, and which machines in the network will deliver the 95% return.&nbsp;In this system, the 95% return is not limited to a specific machine.&nbsp;It is shared with as many machines as are connected to the network. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Another social psychological concept casinos capitalize on is the availability heuristic which states: remembered events tend to be perceived as being more frequent. Thus, small bets are not remembered as they gradually add up but a large win is. Because the win is easily recalled, it leads to the belief that another win will soon come. This is a pattern common in compulsive gamblers--most compulsive gamblers experienced a big win early in their gambling history which convinces them that it will happen again.&nbsp;I suspect that most of you have seen the full page ads taken out by casinos showing one of these lucky winners holding a $10,000 check the size of a filing cabinet.&nbsp;These odds are designed to be memorable in hopes that you will begin to believe that they are frequent.&nbsp;When was the last time you saw a full page ad listing of the hundred thousand people&#39;s losses that contributed to that check? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Casino owners and gambling proponents have invested a great deal in behavioral research.&nbsp; They have become experts--what I would refer to as the Jedi masters--at employing these principles of manipulation upon their patrons. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Lights, sounds, smells, action, shows--all are by design. These are the lure, the bait if you will.&nbsp;Inexpensive prime rib and lodging, lights and excitement, live bands which play loud at night to keep you awake and less so with the rising sun, lighting that is not too bright lest it fatigue your eyes, and attractive attendants. In the 1990&#39;s, Las Vegas invested hundreds of millions to market a &quot;new image&quot; from &quot;sin city&quot; to one of being a family-friendly resort with casinos, building amusement&nbsp;and theme parks to &quot;baby sit&quot; children while the parents were gambling. The effect is to make it as attractive, convenient, and as exciting as possible. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Slot machines are not randomly dispersed throughout the casino, but instead they are methodically crowded together taking advantage of the findings of psychologist Albert Bandura and vicarious reinforcement.&nbsp;When one machine delivers a jackpot, everyone around the winner gets excited. Now think about that.&nbsp;Why is everyone else excited?&nbsp;What did they win? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As we have already demonstrated, research shows that the longer a person plays the more he/she will lose.&nbsp;As one report revealed: &quot;Casinos do not have to try to pull more money out of you, they only have to help you play longer.&quot;&nbsp;This is why there are no windows, clocks or watches and why some have wall and ceiling paintings of daylight scenery to paralyze your perception of time passing and slipping away. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Casino interior designs have been changed based on this research.&nbsp;Casinos create slot machine mazes intentionally crafted so that it requires more time to navigate around and through the building, thereby exposing you to more stimuli in hopes of tempting you to continue your play longer. Neurologist Alan Hirsch researched various aromas until he discovered one most people find appealing.&nbsp;Studies showed that when this aroma was released around slot machines there was a 45% increase of revenue because players continued playing longer. Back supports on slot machine stools, fresh air pumped in every 8 or fewer minutes to keep players alert and reduce drowsiness. Hand pull slot machines are now replaced with push button computer simulators allowing more plays per hour.&nbsp;These same machines now accept both currency and credit cards eliminating the time necessary to create change. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Dealers are instructed to return chips of the lowest denomination because research shows players are more likely to hold on to high denomination chips and spend the low denominations ones because they are more difficult to track.&nbsp;The memory of losing a dollar chip does not remain like the memory of losing a 100 dollar chip. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Colors have been researched.&nbsp;Bright colors draw people in, but softer hues keep people playing longer. So casinos place their brightly colored machines far down a row machines to bring you in and then they place the softer colored ones next to them. This way there is less time spent in what the research calls &quot;transitional periods&quot; where players move to locate another machine. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Some slot machines are intentionally designed to show the symbols just before and after where the reel stops, called the payout line, then computer programs are designed to make multiple symbols come up in pairs more often to make you think you were just one space away from a jackpot when in reality you were no closer than any other spin.&nbsp;Manufacturers create machines where the first two reels have more winning symbols whereas the last wheel has only one. This way it is more likely you will obtain pairs of symbols in the first two reels creating the impression that you were very close to a win. These are what they refer to in the business as &quot;near misses&quot; or &quot;heart stoppers&quot;. Using the social psychological concept of availability heuristic, slot machine manufacturers create the winning symbols on their reels to be more distinctive by making them of a different quality, larger size, and flashing.&nbsp;This way you will be more aware of the winning symbols when they appear and therefore more likely to remember them over the less distinctive losing symbols giving you the false impression that winning symbols appear more often and that your chances of winning are better. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With advances in technologies, slot machine producers have added &quot;stop buttons&quot; that deceive the player into thinking they can control where the wheels stop creating the impression that they can increase their chances of winning.&nbsp;What you are not told is that the stop buttons actually &quot;speed to the end of the machine predetermined spin.&quot; Pushing the button does nothing to change the outcome.&nbsp; However, it does shorten the time it takes the machine to finish its cycle, which means you can make more plays in an hour thereby increasing the amount you play ... and lose. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Additional technologies that have been added to casinos are the radio frequency ID cards.&nbsp;These serve like credit cards so that you do not have to waste time exchanging cash.&nbsp;Research revealed that cardholders averaged $101 in losses compared with $31 for those who did not use them. The card is swiped at any game location and then information about what type of games you played, how much you bet and how often you bet is recorded. Information about when you break for a meal is also sent to the computers as well as your meal selection. The information from these cards is then used to give 10 to 30 percent of the player&#39;s losses back in complimentary awards ... of course for the specific type of games you play most, the type of meal you most often order, or the type of show you prefer in order to attract you to return and play again and cause you to feel happy in the midst of your losses.&nbsp;Studies also reveal that more money is spent when customers stay at the same location as the casino, so complimentary stays are also awarded.&nbsp; Of course, alcoholic beverages are free if state laws permit free drinks; if state laws do not permit free alcoholic beverages the glasses are overfilled ... Hmmm ... out of generosity??? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Some people report that they gamble for the social interaction. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;

However, what you are sold on TV is not what I witnessed in person as I have had to walk through these casinos to reach professional conferences held in their convention auditoriums.&nbsp;The fact that we had to walk through the casino to get to their auditoriums, of course, is also by design just as you have to walk through them to gain access to their restaurants and other offerings.&nbsp;On these occasions I saw mostly solitary people at machines or tables.&nbsp;When there was more than one person in close proximity there was very little social interaction as all were intent on the bet.&nbsp;I suspect a lonely person could wander and try to start up conversation with dealers and pit bosses, but as a U.S. News &amp; World Report article revealed, employees refer to these talkative patrons as &quot;fleas&quot; thus revealing the real depth of these supposed relationships.&nbsp;While the fa&ccedil;ade of nice people is important to present, dealers are under pressure to deal upwards of 75 hands an hour.&nbsp;The article goes on to quote the Vegas World Casino owner, Bob Stupak, as saying, &quot;They better deal as fast as they [expletive] can or they&#39;re gonna work someplace else.&quot;<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">10</a></u></sup>

I suppose you might meet someone other than an employee at these locations, but, if you listened to President Clark&#39;s recent devotional address last month about likes attracting, it is a pretty &quot;good bet&quot; that the odds of finding your eternal temple worthy husband or wife here are worse than your odds of winning their biggest jackpot. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If you came with a social group, accounts indicate that most groups, with perhaps the exception of couples, when they arrive tend to separate to different locations and games in the casino.&nbsp;This is because personal finances are very private.&nbsp;Have you noticed that when anyone talks to you about gambling it is usually about their winnings?&nbsp;When was the last time you heard someone tell you that they went gambling and lost a thousand dollars?&nbsp;I imagine that your most likely response would be to question the gambler&#39;s wisdom.&nbsp;So to protect themselves, most gamblers keep their losses secret. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In actuality, having people watching you play can be detrimental.&nbsp;Studies show that most people tend to make higher risk bets when others are watching than when they are alone.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">11</a></u></sup> If people at the table are making large bets you are more likely to feel pressure to do the same.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">12</a></u></sup> If you win, others perceive you in a positive light whereas if you lose ... well, you lose. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Research on problem gamblers supports this perspective, revealing that they prefer to gamble alone.<u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>13</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, research also indicates that women are more likely to gamble alone and to spend that time with machines as opposed to games of skill.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">14</a></u></sup> Somehow the company of a machine does not seem to me to fit the argument that gambling is for the social interaction. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Of course, with the increase of internet gambling, the argument of gaming for the social reward seems to be even less likely. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Approximately 30-40% of respondents report that the reason they gamble is for the entertainment. Indeed a Los Angeles Times writer, Paul Brownstein, is quoted as saying: 
</p>
<p>
	Gambling is fun.&nbsp;A horribly self-destructive activity if it gets out of control, yes. But in the meantime fun.&nbsp;Fun, fun, fun.<u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>15</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
A vocal proponent of gambling, Frank Fahrenkopt, Jr. writes: 
</p>
<p>
	While the busybodies of the world continue their fight, we, too, will continue to defend the rights of our customers who enjoy the entertainment options we offer ... it&#39;s clear that most people agree that gambling is fun. And that&#39;s my final answer.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">16</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s look at that argument: First, if entertainment was what these games were about, then the least expensive way to play them would be to make the smallest bets and play the least expensive machines. Since it is all the same game, why would anyone bet big money if it was not about the money?&nbsp;Second, as Michael Walker points out in his paper entitled &quot;The Medicalization of Gambling as an Addiction&quot;&nbsp; If entertainment, not money, really is a primary motivation for involvement in these games, what would happen if these machines no longer periodically gave money in return?&nbsp;Would these same people really continue to play?&nbsp;Think about these games; take away the money and they are really quite boring.&nbsp;Can you imagine sitting in front of these machines hour after hour to watch some symboled wheels spinning around just to see if they will match up or a marble rolling around a spinning table to see if it will fall on a number you predicted? Frankly, I don&#39;t even think my grandson would spend his time watching these games more than once or twice! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Since the longer you play, the less money you will make, and since people do not want to admit to wasting their money this way, it is human nature to find a more logical rationale for losing their money and wasting their time.&nbsp;Entertainment is the most widely employed excuse.<u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>17</sup> </a></u>

Suppose you walk out to your car after this forum and discover something green blowing underneath your wheel.&nbsp; You pull it out and discover it to be a $100 bill.&nbsp;Suppose you are also heading toward Fort Hall to spend some time with a friend.&nbsp;Suppose further that you are not a member of the Church and know nothing about gambling except that you have always thought the roulette table looked fun in the western movies.&nbsp;So you decide to give it a try.&nbsp;Okay, now do you place your entire $100 dollar bill on one number to win or do you make 100 single dollar bill bets? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
By raise of hands, how many of you would place the full $100 on one number to win? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
How many would make 100 single dollar bets? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
What does the house want you to do?&nbsp;They want you to make the 100 single bets. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Why? - Because the casino wants you to win.&nbsp;They are desperate for you to win.&nbsp;They want you to win so bad that their teeth ache.&nbsp;The win is the hook. Remember, they are in this for the long haul.&nbsp;It is through the continued play that they get your money. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s look at the odds of your bets.&nbsp;Roulette wheels have 38 numbered positions into which the marble may fall.&nbsp;If you bet $100 on one number your odds are 1:38.&nbsp;If you win, the house will pay you $3600!&nbsp;It is here, in the payout, that the house is skimming money from you and guaranteeing that they will always come out ahead.&nbsp;You take a 1:38 risk and the house only pays you back at a rate of 1:36. Instead paying you 38 dollars for your risk they only pay you 36.&nbsp;Now if you lose you are going to experience an awakening.&nbsp;Just moments ago you had $100.&nbsp;You watched a silly little marble roll around a table, drop down into a groove and now you are $100 poorer than you were moments ago.&nbsp;After that why would anyone gamble again?&nbsp;The house does not want you to have that experience. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now let&#39;s look at the bet most of the rest of you made. When you make your 100 single dollar bets the casino can pretty much guarantee that you will win at least 2 times. Since your odds of guessing right are one in 38, close to every 38 bets you will guess right once.&nbsp;Since 38 goes into 100 twice it is probable that you will have at least two wins.&nbsp;That will be exciting because they will pay you $36 for your $1 bet! After you have placed your 100 single dollar bets you will now have $72.&nbsp;Isn&#39;t that exciting??? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now let&#39;s look at your odds. What has to happen in order for you to win the same $3600 you made by placing your $100 bill on one chance to win?&nbsp;To end up with the same amount of money from single dollar bets you have to select the correct number for that marble 100 times in a row!&nbsp;Do you have any idea what those odds are? I will show you: 1:151,091,036,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now that is what I call a bail out!&nbsp; Is it any wonder they want you to play more? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Some people claim that they gamble for the &quot;rush&quot; or excitement. There is this element: if I were about to lose $100+ dollars because a marble looked like it was going to stop in any of 37 different places I did not choose ... I might feel a little emotion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Last, let&#39;s look at addiction. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Various studies indicate that approximately 3-5% of the population are problem or compulsive gamblers; with higher percentages among adolescent and college populations (8%). Although this may not look like very much these numbers are similar to the prevalence of cancer and 5 times the rate of schizophrenia. (NCALG)<u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>18</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Casinos employ what psychologists refer to as a variable ratio schedule of reinforcement in their slot machines and other games of chance. A variable ratio means that the ratio of plays to wins constantly changes. This is the most addictive schedule of reinforcement known in the field of psychology.&nbsp; It is selected by design. Using this type of reinforcement schedule, psychologists have been able to get rats to press a bar to exhaustion.&nbsp; If you think about it, how many of you would play a dollar slot machine that took your money nine times and then on the tenth play &nbsp;gave you back 9 dollars?&nbsp; Who would play those games?&nbsp; But change the system to a variable ration schedule of reinforcement and everyone will play them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Of course the resulting debt means fewer family expenditures, bills that are overdue, utilities shut off, repossession, eviction, possible foreclosure, spouses harassed by bill collectors, insomnia, depression, lost employment, embezzlement, fraud, theft, felony, divorce, and lost families.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Studies indicate that of pathological gamblers, 18-28% of males and 8% of females declare bankruptcy, 57% report having stolen from others, 30-40% have embezzled from their employer, 63% have written bad checks, 23% had affairs, 35% divorced, and 13-18% have attempted suicide. <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">19</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Having discussed the logic behind gambling let&#39;s spend the reminder of our time looking at what prophets and apostles have said on this subject.&nbsp; Since the <strong><u>word</u></strong> &quot;gambling&quot; does not explicitly show up in the Ten Commandments or for that matter in any of the standard works, perhaps many people, Mormons included, have assumed, or rationalized that it was &quot;fair game.&quot;&nbsp; Numerous presidents of the Church have spoken out against gambling.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Heber J. Grant and his counselors in the First Presidency issued the following statement to the Church on this subject back in 1926: 
</p>
<p>
<em>&quot;The Church has been and now is unalterably opposed to gambling in any form whatever,&quot; &quot;It is opposed to any game of chance, occupation, or so-called business, which takes money from the person who may be possessed of it without giving value received in return. It is opposed to all practices the tendency of which is to encourage the spirit of reckless speculation, and particularly to that which tends to degrade or weaken the high moral standard which members of the Church, and our community at large, have always maintained.&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">20</a></u></sup></em><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
From our discussion today it should be clear that ultimately gambling is about getting money. Regardless of the other reasons people give, if they are honest, money is the common denominator. &nbsp;Gambling is the manifestation of a selfish spirit.&nbsp; Gamblers seek what they have not earned. .&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">21</a></u></sup> It is in complete opposition to the principles and doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; President Joseph F. Smith stated that: &quot;<u>The desire to get something of value for little or nothing is pernicious</u>&quot;. <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">22</a></u></sup> President Stephen L Richards underscores the same sentiment explaining that it &quot;proceeds upon the assumption that one has to lose for another to gain.&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">23</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Said President Spencer W. Kimball: &quot;We call upon all the ....... members of this church to be honest, full of integrity, pay for what they get and take only that which they have properly paid for. We must teach our children honor and integrity.&quot; <u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>24</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The concepts and principles that are subtly sold through gambling are fatally destructive and always undermine the character and purposes of true disciples of the Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Dallin H. Oaks, a champion in the war against gambling has frequently spoken out against the temporal and spiritual destruction that follows those who fall victim to the false promises of this activity.&nbsp; He teaches &quot;Whenever we as Latter-day Saints engage in any kind of conduct that is inconsistent with the companionship of the Spirit of the Lord, we pay an enormous price.&quot; He adds that it : &nbsp;&quot;......is (an) extraordinary waste of time...&quot; and that &quot; Those who while away their hours gambling frequently do so to the neglect of family and work.&quot; <u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>25</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Council of the Twelve (1872-1952) gave vivid expression to this thought: 
</p>
<p>
<em>&quot;They who gamble, who walk with chance, suffer degeneration of character; they become spiritually flabby; they end as enemies of a wholesome society. A gambling den, however beautifully housed, is the ugliest place on earth.....&nbsp; After an afternoon or evening at card-playing, nothing has been changed, no new knowledge, thoughts, or visions have come, no new hopes or aspirations have been generated, except for another opportunity to waste precious hours. It leads nowhere; it is a dead-end road. ... Dull and deadly is a life which does not seek to immerse itself in the rapidly moving stream of new and increasing knowledge and power. Time is required to &lsquo;keep up with the times.&#39; We dare not waste time on pastimes that starve the soul.&quot; &nbsp; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">26</a></u></sup></em>
</p>
<p>
President Spencer W. Kimball indicated that : &quot;Even a <em>small</em> payoff is counter to the spirit of the work ethic. The size of the prize is irrelevant-even if the gambler breaks even. &quot;The deterioration and damage comes to the person, whether he wins or loses, to get something for nothing, something without effort, something without paying the full price,&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">27</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Quoting an editorial in USA Today, President Gordon B. Hinckley said: &lsquo;...the overwhelming majority of players always lose. The game takes bread and money from the poor. And it is one more temptation for the compulsive gamblers who ruin careers and families with their addiction. &quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">28</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
More Recently in his 2005 address on gambling President Hinckley plead: &quot;Please, please do not fritter away your time or your talents in an aimless pursuit. If you do so, it will lessen your capacity to do worthwhile things.&nbsp; I believe it will dull your sensitivity to your studies in school. It will disappoint your parents, and as the years pass and you look back, you will be disappointed with yourself.&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">29</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In an attempt to counter these moral issues many argue that the money from gambling is used to support charities and good causes such as the use of gambling tax revenues to build bridges, repair roads, provide jobs, and build infrastructure.&nbsp; Somehow I cannot seem to bring myself to belief that people who go to casinos are thinking &quot;I am making this bet so that I can improve the streets or support the local food bank.&quot;&nbsp; The reality is that very little of gambling revenue actually goes to either state taxes, charities or even to pay employees.&nbsp; The majority of winnings go to the owners of the casinos.&nbsp; It would seem to me that if one really wanted to donate to a charity you would want your entire contribution to go to the cause, not just 5 to 20 percent of it.&nbsp; Just imagine as President Kimball stated: &nbsp;&quot;What would $30 billion a year do to help the starving people?&quot; &nbsp;<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">30</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Joseph F. Smith and his counselors in a statement of the First Presidency to the Church stated: 
</p>
<p>
	Let it not be thought that raffling articles of value, offering prizes to the winners in guessing-contests, the use of machines of chance, or any other device of the kind is to be allowed or excused because the money so obtained is to be used for a good purpose. The Church is not to be supported in any degree by means obtained through gambling. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Whatever may be the condition elsewhere, this custom is not to be sanctioned within this Church; and any organization allowing such is in opposition to the counsel and instruction of the general authorities of the Church.<sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">31</a></u></sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
President Young once said to Sister Eliza R. Snow: &quot;Tell the sisters not to raffle. If the mothers raffle, the children will gamble. Raffling is gambling.&quot; Then he added: &quot;Some say &#39;What shall we do? We have quilts on hand,-we cannot sell them, and we need means to supply our treasury, which we can obtain by raffling, for the benefit of the poor.&#39; His response: &quot;Rather let the quilts rot on the shelves than adopt the old adage, &#39;The end will sanctify the means.&#39; As Latter-day Saints, we cannot afford to sacrifice moral principle to financial gain.&quot; <u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>32</sup> </a></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and Sisters, let&#39;s say that you were one of those lucky 1:35 million.&nbsp; When you leave the casino, whose money is in your pockets?&nbsp; We have clearly learned that it is not the casino&#39;s.&nbsp; They never lose.&nbsp; That money in your pocket is the money from the guy who just lost his paycheck and now has to go home and tell his wife that they do not have any money to purchase food for his family or pay their months bills.&nbsp; It is the money from the person who, because he has lost his paycheck has maxed out his credit cards.&nbsp; It is the money from the person who because he has lost his paycheck and maxed out his credit cards that he now defrauds his employer or writes bad checks.&nbsp; It is the money from the person who, because he has broken the law and is now under investigation, his wife and children leave him.&nbsp; It is the money from the person who because he has lost his employment, wife and family and is about to go to jail he goes home and takes his own life.&nbsp; That is whose money is in your pocket.&nbsp; Is there any wonder then, why the Church does not accept tithing on this money?&nbsp;&nbsp; What good can you do with that kind of money? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To all of you here today I say: &nbsp;all forms of gambling are destructive.&nbsp; It is contrary to the character of the Savior, it is contrary to the covenants of temple worship. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Win or lose it will leave you and your loved ones spiritually bankrupt.&nbsp; Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ Amen.

President and Sister Clark, colleagues and students, it came as a startling surprise when I received the invitation to speak at this devotional. I was truly humbled and am further humbled as I stand before you today. I pray that our collective attitude and preparation may invite the Holy Spirit to teach each of us who participates today. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Immediately upon accepting this assignment, my mind raced with thoughts of what I would discuss, as no topic was assigned. Not knowing what I would talk about was quite disconcerting to me. So I solicited input from some of my students. Their suggestions included: dealing with distractions, humility, unity, temple preparation, music, honesty, tolerance, and how to maintain individuality within a group, among others--all very worthy subjects. Ultimately it was inspiration that led me to my topic.&nbsp; One morning I awoke earlier than usual, before my alarm clock sounded. The thought came into my mind, not audibly, but as words that were silently spoken directly into my mind, &quot;Talk about what you <em>know</em>.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
What I know--with regard to the Gospel, of course. What I <em>know</em>. I was absolutely certain that these words were spoken to me as a revelation, as an answer to my prayers about my topic for this devotional address, but to be honest, I was not exactly sure what they meant. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve struggled at times throughout my adult life with the connotation of the word <em>know</em>, especially as we use it to share our testimonies of Jesus Christ and the restored gospel. When we say we <em>know</em> something is real or true, what do we really mean? What does it mean to <em>know?</em> How do <em>knowledge</em> and <em>belief</em> differ? How do we gain <em>knowledge</em>? These are questions that people have wrestled with for centuries. Plato&#39;s definition of knowledge as &quot;justified true belief&quot; was the product of one of the earliest secular attempts to understand the nature of knowledge. The pursuit of understanding the nature of <em>knowledge</em> eventually grew into its own branch of philosophy, known as <em>epistemology</em>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Although a thorough look at the history of epistemology would be fascinating, and even uplifting, our weekly devotionals are times of worship. Hence, appropriate to the occasion, today let us examine knowledge through the lens of the gospel, taking as our texts the words of prophets and personal experience to address the concept and acquisition of <em>knowledge,</em> particularly knowledge of the divinity of our Father in Heaven, of our Savior Jesus Christ, and all attendant aspects of their existence. I hope to illustrate the roles of <em>faith</em>, <em>belief</em>, and the <em>Holy Ghost</em> in our pursuit of gospel knowledge.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In our own scriptural canon there exists a distinction between <em>knowledge</em> and <em>belief</em>. In the thirteenth and fourteenth verses of <em>Doctrine and Covenants</em> Section forty-six, it says: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	To some it is <em>given by the Holy Ghost</em> to <em>know </em>that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. 
	</p>
<p>
	To others it is given to <em>believe</em> on their words, that they also might&nbsp;have eternal life <em>if they continue faithful</em><strong>.</strong> (Emphasis added.) <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">1</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
These verses suggest that both belief and knowledge are gifts from God. They also suggest that those blessed with belief must exercise faith. <em>Knowledge</em> that Jesus Christ is the Son of God is a gift of the Holy Ghost, and differs from belief. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s look at these teachings in more detail. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First we will discuss <em>faith</em> and <em>belief</em>, and then <em>knowledge</em>, as it pertains to knowing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder John K. Carmack provides a masterful discussion on the nature of faith. I quote: 
</p>
<p>
	&quot;What is faith? Like a nugget of pure and precious gold ore, faith has many surfaces and defies a one-dimensional definition.&quot; The Apostle Paul&#39;s statement that &quot;faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&quot; (JST, Heb. 11:1) is a classic statement where we can begin our dig. Often in the scriptures, <em>faith</em> <em>seems almost to be a synonym for belief</em>, albeit a strong belief that leads to righteous living and action.Yet faith is based in the truth, whereas belief alone may be in what is true or false. (Emphasis added.) <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">2</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>

<img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/090602Native_gold_nuggets.jpg" border="0" alt="Gold Nuggets" width="320" height="215" />
</p>
<p align="center">
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">
Alma also teaches this important principle in his landmark lecture on faith and belief in the thirty-second chapter of Alma. In verse twenty-one, he teaches: 
</p>
<p>
	And now as I said concerning faith--faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true. <sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">3</a></sup>
</p>

We are familiar with Alma&#39;s sermon. In order to determine if the things that we hope for are true, we must &quot;arouse our faculties to an experiment upon the word [of the Lord, as found in the scriptures, or in the testimonies of the living prophets and apostles], and exercise a particle of faith.&quot; Alma encourages us that &quot;even if [we] can no more than desire to believe, [to] let this desire work in [us], even until [we] believe in a manner that [we] can give place for a portion of [the word of God].&quot; 
</p>
<p>

<p>
Elder Carmack continues on this topic: 
</p>
<p>
	Achieving the gift of a strong belief is one aspect of faith. The belief part of faith may start as merely a desire to believe but can grow &lsquo;brighter and brighter until the perfect day&#39; (D&amp;C 50:24). Then one could say about the person whose belief has progressed to perfection, &lsquo;your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know&#39; (Alma 32:34). <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">4</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
Elder Carmack also teaches that even when our belief is perfected through faith into knowledge, there is yet another aspect of faith, the <em>power</em> aspect, which can remain active even after belief has progressed to knowledge. &quot;Such faith,&quot; taught Elder Carmack, &quot;is a great tool to do the Lord&#39;s work. Men and women can grow in spirituality to the point that they can do mighty things in the cause of the Lord, and when they do them, they operate by the power of faith.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The scriptures are replete with illustrations of such faith. One of my favorites, and certainly one of the most exciting, is recorded in the seventeenth chapter of First Samuel in the Old Testament, where the Israelites and the Philistines faced each other in battle across the valley of Elah. The Philistine army produced the infamous nine-foot giant Goliath, who taunted the Israelites, bellowing: 
</p>
<p>
	... choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. <u><sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">5</a></sup></u>
</p>
<p>
For forty days the two armies battled and the giant continued to intimidate the armies of Saul, until one day when the young David was delivering provisions to his brothers at the front lines and happened to witness firsthand the heckling of this obstreperous barbarian. While the tone of David&#39;s inquiries regarding the giant foreshadow the hubris of his later career, his faith in God, in this situation, is nonetheless remarkable:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who <em>is</em> this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">6</a></u></sup>&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p>
David&#39;s older brother overheard his inquiries and was angry with him for not watching the family&#39;s sheep and for sneaking to the front lines to glimpse the battle. Word of David and his curiosity regarding Goliath reached Saul, who then summoned the boy. David said to Saul: 
</p>
<p>
	...Let no man&#39;s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou <em>art but</em> a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father&#39;s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 
	</p>
<p>
	And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered <em>it</em> out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught <em>him</em> by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	David said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee. <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">7</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
David, unarmored and armed with only a sling and five smooth stones, proceeded to face the heavily armored Goliath, who challenged David, saying: 
</p>
<p>
	Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">8</a></u></sup>&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">
David&#39;s response to this mortal threat further illustrates the faith he had in his Father in Heaven:&nbsp; 
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	...Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. 
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
	&nbsp;This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. 
	</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
	And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle <em>is</em> the Lord&#39;s, and he will give you into our hands. <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">9</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
We know how the story ends. David&#39;s faith in his God moved him to action, the stone from his sling striking the Philistine with such force that it sunk into his forehead, knocking him to the ground. Thereupon David finished the job by slaying Goliath with his own sword. 
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">
It is unlikely that many, or any, of us will be required to demonstrate our faith in such a harrowing and dramatic way. Nevertheless, David&#39;s actions in this situation provide a model for us as we seek to exercise faith. David, <em>as a youth</em>, believed that the Lord was aware of him as an individual and had protected him from perils he faced previously in his life. He believed that it was the Lord who blessed him to overcome the attacking lion and bear. These experiences strengthened his faith in the Lord. Past blessings produced present confidence that the Lord would again bless in the future. When he was preparing to face Goliath in mortal combat, a seemingly insurmountable, impossible task, it was prior experiences of his youth that allowed him to exercise faith to represent the army of Israel in the one-on-one bout with Goliath. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I doubt that many of you have had to defend a flock of sheep from a lion or a bear, as David did, but I am certain that each of you has had an experience, or multiple experiences similar to David&#39;s--experiences that have led you to believe in your Father in Heaven, and in his son Jesus Christ. These experiences can become powerful agents in the development of your faith. And faith, as we have witnessed in this story of David and Goliath, can be a powerful principle of action. 
</p>

<p>
I joined the Church as a convert in 1976, just a few days after my ninth birthday. I was baptized on the same day as my parents. Together my mom, dad, younger sister and I made the transition from being non-attending Presbyterians to active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And what a transition it was! Sundays, in the 1970s, consisted of at least two trips to the church-one for Sunday school and one for Sacrament meeting. And Primary was held after school on a weekday! While I am sure I learned quickly, I still remember feeling awkward when I didn&#39;t know the answers even to the easy questions in Primary. It was not until I had children of my own that I realized how much gospel learning could take place in the first eight or nine years of a child&#39;s life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps due to my late start, I&#39;ve often felt somewhat less spiritually mature than many of my LDS peers. Nevertheless, like David of the Old Testament, I had experiences in my youth that to me, particularly in hindsight, have allowed me to believe in a loving Heavenly Father who knows me personally. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I am certain that if each of us thinks carefully enough, we can recall an experience in which we felt--even knew--that Father in Heaven was cognizant of us as an individual. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One of the more powerful such experiences of my youth occurred in late August or early September of 1985, just a few days before I was to begin my freshman year at BYU. I had worked hard to fit my schedule together--you know how tricky it can be to get into each of the classes you need at the times you need them. Having completed this tedious task, I don&#39;t know why I was still perusing the course schedule. Nevertheless I still vividly remember sitting at the kitchen table in my parents&#39; home, flipping through the pages, when my eyes landed on the bold-type word &quot;Chinese&quot;--the catalog heading for the Chinese courses offered that semester.&nbsp; At that moment I experienced a feeling quite unlike anything I&#39;d ever experienced. It was almost as if I&#39;d been shocked by some unseen electrical source--not a painful shock, but clearly some sort of physical feeling. Not simply an idea or brainstorm or a thought popping into my head. I knew--I knew--at that very instant that I <em>must</em> study Chinese. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Prior to this profound impression to study Chinese, I had only a small handful of remote recollections of even hearing references to China. The first was a memory of a radio news broadcast announcing the death of Mao Zedong, leader of the People&#39;s Republic of China. That would have been in September of 1976, when I was eight years old. I remember a high school classmate writing a report on Genghis Khan, whose progeny overthrew the Chinese empire in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. And finally, I remember overhearing a friend of another classmate talking about a trip to China he and his brother planned to make after they graduated. That&#39;s it. So this crazy compelling feeling to study Chinese was really &quot;out of the blue.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Lacking confidence, I made my way to the office of Professor Gary Williams, then chair of the Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages at BYU. Professor Williams was patient with my na&iuml;ve inquiries and encouraged me to sign up for Chinese 101. 
</p>
<p>
My life has been richly blessed because of my decision to follow the promptings I felt to take that first Chinese class. I was better prepared to serve the Lord in Taiwan, where I was called as a missionary a year after taking that first Chinese class--to serve under Mission President Gary Williams, coincidentally! Upon completing my mission I taught Mandarin in the MTC. And there are many other experiences that resulted from that decision to register for Chinese 101. I would not likely be a professor of Chinese at BYU-Idaho today had I not followed that initial impression. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, I recognize that it was my belief and my faith that a loving Heavenly Father had spoken to me that gave me the courage to follow the inspiration to begin studying Chinese. But from where did that feeling come? And why was it so powerful to cause me to take such seemingly baseless action? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As Latter-day Saints, we believe that the Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead, also composed of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Unlike Father in Heaven and our Savior, the Holy Ghost does not have a body of flesh and bone. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1839, the Prophet Joseph Smith met with then President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. The account in the <em>History of the Church</em> reads, &quot;In our interview with the President, he interrogated us wherein we differed in our religion from the other religions of the day. Brother Joseph said we differed in mode of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. We considered that all other considerations were contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost.&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">10</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One of the missions of the Holy Ghost is to <em>inspire</em>. <u><sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">11</a></sup></u>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Inspiration</em> from the Holy Ghost is open to all people. The First Presidency has taught that 
</p>
<p>
	the great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God&#39;s light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals. ... We believe that God has given and will give to all peoples sufficient knowledge to help them on their way to eternal salvation. <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">12</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
Though all are entitled to feel the influence of the Holy Ghost, not all recognize it. Learning to recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost, and furthermore to purify our lives to be worthy of such influence, is imperative if we are to avail ourselves of inspiration and revelation graciously given us by God. Elder James E. Talmage wrote eloquently on this topic: 
</p>
<p>
	Subtler, mightier, and more mysterious than any or all of the physical forces of nature are the powers that operate upon conscious organisms, the means by which the mind, the heart, the soul of man may be energized by spiritual forces. In our ignorance of the true nature of electricity we may speak of it as a fluid; and so by analogy the forces through which the mind is governed have been called spiritual fluids. The true nature of these manifestations of energy is unknown to us, for the elements of comparison and analogy, so necessary to our human reasoning, are wanting; nevertheless the effects are experienced by all. <u><sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">13</a></sup></u>
</p>
<p>
When we are baptized members of the Church, we have the opportunity to receive the <em>gift of the Holy Ghost, </em>which entitles us to numerous precious blessings, not the least of which is <em>revelation</em>, yet another mission of the Holy Ghost. Elder Dallin H. Oaks has taught that one of the primary purposes of revelation is &quot;testimony or witness of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ and that the gospel is true.&quot;&nbsp;<u><sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">14 </a></sup></u>Such would be the gift of knowledge referred to in the forty-sixth section discussed previously. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
So it seems that today, so far, I haven&#39;t yet told you what I know, but have rather taken you with me on a close reading of a scripture containing priceless counsel on belief, faith, and knowledge. I believe that the Lord gave us this inspired counsel because He knows that the degree of certainty we feel about various aspects of our understanding and testimonies of the Gospel will vary throughout our lives. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Just as the Holy Ghost can give us the gift of knowledge and testimony, so too can he inspire us in other experiences that strengthen our belief and our faith, allowing us to draw closer to our Father in Heaven by availing ourselves of the atoning and enabling power of the Atonement of his Son, Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As Elder Neil L. Anderson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has taught, &quot;we don&#39;t know everything, but we know enough.&quot; <sup><u><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">15</a></u></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I know, unequivocally, that the experience I had that impelled me to begin my study of Chinese nearly twenty-five years ago, was Heavenly Father informing me, through the power of the Holy Ghost, of a path I could choose that would bring many blessings into my life. Having followed that powerful prompting and made that decision, and personally experiencing its consequences, I have come to know with certainty that we are children of a loving Heavenly Father; that he communicates with us, that our life on Earth has purpose, and that these principles I have discussed today are true. Just as David recognized that it was the Lord who helped him to overpower the lion and bear, I too recognized the hand of deity in my life in the experience I shared today, as well as in many others. These have been a great strength to me throughout my life. Many of you have already had, and all can yet have, and have again and again, experiences that will strengthen your belief and give you courage to act in faith, just as David did when he recalled experiences from his youth that gave him courage to fight Goliath. I pray that we will not become mired in concern over the depth of our knowledge, if we find it lacking; that we will remember that both knowledge and belief are gifts from God. And that those who remain faithful in their belief can have eternal life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<p align="left">Thank you for that wonderful music. Thank you for the choice of the scripture. Thank you for singing songs we used to sing in this place some years ago. It has been a joy for Sister Eyring and me to return to this campus. You have been kind and gracious. We have felt welcomed home, but to a home changed for the better.&nbsp;The two-year college has become a great university.&nbsp;Beautiful buildings now cover slopes which, when we first arrived were so far above the campus that I toured them on skis with my young sons.&nbsp;The student trailers where we lived in our first months have gone.&nbsp;I doubt that I could find now where that trailer park was, amongst the beauties of this campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all the improvements, what touched my heart most as we arrived Friday was the sight of the sacred temple on the hill, so close to the University that it seemed a part of it.&nbsp;When we came here in 1972, people spoke fondly of the "College on the Hill."&nbsp;The two original pioneer buildings and even the ones built later seemed to stand only a few feet higher than the surrounding land.&nbsp;But to those who loved it and saw it as the Lord's school it appeared elevated.&nbsp;They felt they were going up, up&nbsp;to the college on the hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures speak of attending a temple as going up to the mountain of the Lord's house.&nbsp;When searching for temple sites, the Lord's prophets look for places where those who approach could have the feeling of going up. In my days serving in the Presiding Bishopric I was charged at times with bringing back, from trips across the world, information about possible temple sites.&nbsp;The questions when I returned from the Lord's prophets always included how the site would appear to the people coming up to it; they wanted those people to feel a sense of elevation.&nbsp;For the same reason, a temple's interior is designed to give patrons the experience of rising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The early Saints, as they created pioneer settlements in the American west, watched for elevated places for the future temples they dreamed would rise. They often referred to those places as, "Temple Hill."&nbsp;That was true here. When we arrived I was told that the small hospital, where our fourth son was born in our first year, was on "Temple Hill."&nbsp;The early settlers had their dream fulfilled but not on the hill they expected.&nbsp;The hospital has now been replaced by one much larger and better.&nbsp;And a living prophet has placed a beautiful temple of the Lord high above yet integrally linked to His new university, which was born out of the little college on the hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My purpose today is to tell you something of the miracle it is to have both the Lord's house and this university on one hill in Rexburg.&nbsp;Having described that miracle, I will suggest how best to recognize and so receive the blessings which can flow from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The miracle has at least three parts:&nbsp;first, that the temple and the university are side-by-side on one Rexburg hill; second, that the two were created together at this time; and third, that the few but significant differences between the university and the temple should combine so well to accomplish the Lord's purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there is the miracle of location.&nbsp;This is the restored Church of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;The prophecy for the Latter Days is being fulfilled. The Gospel is being taken to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.&nbsp;Yet, even with the generous spread of temples across the earth, only the tiniest fraction of the members can reach a temple of God without great sacrifice in time and means.&nbsp;And there are more millions in the Spirit world who feel that pain and frustration that their faithful descendants feel that Temple ordinances are not being made available to them.&nbsp;In the time I was in the Presiding Bishopric I provided to the Lord's prophets the information they requested to make the agonizing choice of in which place people could have the blessing of a temple within their reach and which would have to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophets make similarly difficult decisions about Church universities.&nbsp;The chance to learn in such a faith-filled community as this is out of the reach-but not out of the hope-of thousands.&nbsp;Their missionary experiences and the blessings of the Perpetual Education Fund fuel their desires for learning in the powerful way possible here.&nbsp;In the time I was the Commissioner of Education for the Church I helped the prophets respond to people begging for campuses like this.&nbsp;In many cases, they&nbsp;offered land and donations.&nbsp;Some offered already established schools if only we would take them over. Time after time I had to write kindly responses on behalf of the prophet to help faithful people accept his judgment that the Church could not responsibly invest and spend more in higher education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before serving in the Presiding Bishopric and as Commissioner of Education I presided over what was then called Ricks College.&nbsp;In those days there were those who dreamed that the college would become a university.&nbsp;As the president of Ricks College, I explained countless times the reasons why it would remain, perhaps forever,&nbsp;a two-year school.&nbsp;I told them traditional universities, the kind with graduate programs and competitive athletic programs, are terribly expensive.&nbsp;They seemed to never understand. Temples are also expensive, not only to build but also to operate.&nbsp;With a large temple just down the road in Idaho Falls, it was hard to imagine a temple in Rexburg.&nbsp;In fact, my later experience in the Presiding Bishopric seemed to confirm that conclusion:&nbsp;none of the lists of places needing and deserving a temple that I prepared for the Presidents of the Church had Rexburg on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the word miracle in describing the location of this university next to a temple on one hill because I know that only God could have done it.&nbsp;Human judgment would have kept Ricks College at two-year status and allocated the Church's resources for higher education someplace else.&nbsp;Human judgment would have placed the temple somewhere else.&nbsp;But human judgment could have foreseen neither smaller temples operated primarily by volunteers nor a university capable of serving many students at high quality and low cost.&nbsp;That this university and this temple are on a hill in Rexburg is a miracle because God, not man, revealed new designs for each and placed them here together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God performed these miracles by revelation to his prophets, not through the people who advise them.&nbsp;I say that from personal experiences in providing advice on both universities and temples, and then watching God speak to his prophets, sometimes taking my help and sometimes more often not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like Rexburg, Bountiful was never on the list of recommended or even possible temple sites during the time I was doing the work for the Prophet of God.&nbsp;In the late 1980s, in fact, a brilliant man working for the Presiding Bishopric and for me prepared a list, using careful statistical analysis, of one hundred places deserving temples.&nbsp;I delivered it to the President.&nbsp;Based on the criteria we used to make that list, Bountiful, which is where my family and I then lived, would not have appeared in the second or third-hundred possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not many weeks after I sent the list of one hundred sites to the President, our son John, the one born in the old Madison Memorial Hospital, came home from the Bountiful Seminary.&nbsp;He announced with some enthusiasm, "A Dad in seminary today told me that the Church has purchased a site for a temple on Bountiful Boulevard."&nbsp;I said to him with great emphasis, and some annoyance, "John, I am in charge of evaluating and buying sites for temples.&nbsp;If you look as if you even think that unfounded story might be true, people will believe it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within a day or two, my wife said that she had heard in Relief Society that the Church had purchased a future temple site in Bountiful.&nbsp;I told her, "Kathy, I am in charge.&nbsp;That is an unfounded rumor, and you mustn't even appear to believe it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day in the media, the Church announced the purchase of a temple site in Bountiful. I called Clair Bankhead, who worked with me buying temple properties and sites.&nbsp;I asked, "Clair, why didn't you tell me?"&nbsp;He said, "President Benson told me to buy it and not to tell anyone. So I did what the Prophet asked."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When John came home that day after hearing the news, he said with a smile, "Now I know what it means for you to be in charge."&nbsp;So did I.&nbsp;And now&nbsp;so do you. The Prophet, who holds all the keys of the Kingdom, including the keys of the sealing power, is directly accountable to the Lord for temples.&nbsp;Others may help, but the Lord decides and tells His Prophet.&nbsp;It was a miracle that Bountiful, twenty minutes from Salt Lake and twenty-five from Ogden, received a temple. Likewise, it is a gracious gift of God that Rexburg has a temple so close to Idaho Falls, when people across Asia and Africa and South America still sacrifice so much time and means to reach a temple of God.&nbsp;The miracle is that the Lord inspired, and the prophet obeyed. And now this hill has a temple on it next to a university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the Rexburg temple, I know from personal experience that this university's being on this hill is a miracle granted directly by God through a living prophet.&nbsp;One day in early 2000 President Hinckley asked me to follow him to his office after a Board of Education meeting. I was the Commissioner of Education at the time.&nbsp;I wondered why he had invited me there. After I sat down in his office, his first words were, "Hal, don't you think it's about time that Ricks College became a four-year school?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After hearing my brief reply, which was one of support but some wonder,&nbsp;I got a great surprise. I saw as I gave him&nbsp;the advantages and the disadvantages which he asked for, it was clear that he had&nbsp;already decided that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho. He said that I was the first person he told of his decision.&nbsp;He had never asked me or my staff for any information to help him consider such a decision.&nbsp;He simply knew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so I know that the decision to place on this hill a university next to a temple was made by the Lord directly through his prophet.&nbsp;In such matters of importance it is the Lord's way. Through the miracle of revelation the Lord conveys His will to His living prophet.&nbsp;And that is a miracle for which we must be forever grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timing of placing the university and the temple together on this hill is yet another miracle of the Lord's hand working on people.&nbsp;A remarkable group of teachers and leaders have been gathered at this university.&nbsp;They are finding ways to accelerate the rise in the quality of teaching and learning by increasing the influence of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;Despite demographic declines in college-age Church members, the number seeking to come here has increased.&nbsp;The faculty and the leaders at the university have found a way not only to deal with the larger numbers but to do it frugally.&nbsp;Frugality and a spirit of sacrifice were put in place here long ago by a God who saw our time and the future before us.&nbsp;That frugality, among other important spiritual qualities, helped qualify Ricks College to become BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as the university is led by consecrated faculty and administrators, a gifted servant of God&nbsp;was called to this new temple on the hill as its president.&nbsp;He is, by his background and capacity, able to appreciate what great experiences the students will be having.&nbsp;He has called, through inspiration and with the counsel of local priesthood leaders, an army of consecrated volunteers to staff the temple.&nbsp;They invite members of the University community to temple service in a way that can lift them and elevate their learning experiences both in the Lord's house and at His university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple president and those who work with him know the goodness of the people in the community and the opportunities and challenges they encounter in establishing a special kind of university, a university fit for a temple hill.&nbsp;They are sensitive to the feelings of those who have the need for peace and generosity in the midst of great change.&nbsp;The president and his fellow temple workers will create an atmosphere of faith, hope, and charity which invites the Spirit, thus making the temple a place of spiritual refuge and a source of the revelation we will increasingly need on this hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The university will likewise encourage a thirst for learning by the Spirit.&nbsp;In concert with the temple, it will build students' confidence that the Spirit can become a constant companion.&nbsp;The university and the temple are alike in teaching that service to others is a necessary part of inviting the Spirit.&nbsp;The university operates on the principle that everyone is both a teacher and a learner.&nbsp;The university is, like the temple, a place where success can come only if we help others succeed.&nbsp;Those who attend the temple to offer their departed ancestors proxy covenants do it gladly, knowing that they cannot be saved without those departed loved ones.&nbsp;The two places of learning fit together in their purposes almost as one.&nbsp;They both encourage all that would qualify for us to have eternal life.&nbsp;And they both require a high standard of personal worthiness for the companionship of the Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is at least one way in which the university and the temple must differ because of their distinct purposes. The temple president is charged with seeing that the teaching and the ordinances in the temple do not change.&nbsp;The university president, on the other hand, is charged with continuous change which improves teaching and learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are important reasons for this difference between the temple, which rarely changes, and the university, which changes continuously. A dedicated temple is the only place in the world where the sealing power of the Priesthood is exercised.&nbsp;That power is eternal.&nbsp;Thus, the ordinances of the temple are the same across every nation and over time.&nbsp;Alterations, if any,&nbsp;are made only by the prophet, who holds the keys of the sealing power for the whole earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast to the temple president, the university president is charged with leading continuous improvement, and that requires change.&nbsp;The knowledge taught in universities is, through the discoveries of inspired men and women around the world, always expanding.&nbsp;In science, for example, even our notions of space and time are changing.&nbsp;The laws of men, such as trade treaties and tax codes, also change.&nbsp;Not only will the faculty of a great university stay abreast of these changes, they will find, with the help of the Spirit, ever-better ways to teach and help students learn the new knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing to change in the university will lead to failure.&nbsp;But we will not fail.&nbsp;The constancy of the temple will supply peace and a sure steady bearing, like a guiding star, for those navigating uncertain waters. The differences in the two places of learning complement each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been speaking of the blessings which will flow to those in this great university and to those who will come to the temple here.&nbsp;But blessings will also go from this university and temple on the hill into the surrounding valley and out to the world.&nbsp;In fact, the blessings we receive on this hill are only possible because of the goodness and sacrifices of many who are neither enrolled in nor employed by the university.&nbsp;They include ecclesiastical leaders drawn from surrounding stakes, leaders of government organizations, and the operators of business that serve the BYU-Idaho community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the people who learn and serve here will be changed for the better.&nbsp;Wherever they go they will be more eager to help others, more determined to keep promises, more confident that with God's help we can accomplish hard things, and more inclined to give credit for success to others but mostly to God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will live in this community.&nbsp;They will go out to work as interns across the world.&nbsp;They will go to the professions and to companies and to governments.&nbsp;They will be admitted to other universities.&nbsp;And most importantly they will create families where what they have learned and taught will be passed on for generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been to a number of funerals and in homes lately where parents have done with children what we are trying to do within this university and this temple on the hill.&nbsp;They have taught and learned under the influence of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;The Atonement of Jesus Christ has changed the hearts of children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is humbling and thrilling to see the change. I saw it in Rexburg this weekend, as children so small that they needed a higher place to stand to reach the microphone bore testimony of the Savior and his prophets.&nbsp;I was amazed and humbled to hear words and feel spiritual power I would only expect from a mature member of the Church. I saw it later in the quiet manner of a couple speaking with a smile of the passing of one of them soon through the portal of death into the next world where they are sure they will be reunited.&nbsp;I saw it in the face and heard it in the voice of a widow living alone and in a wheelchair, waiting with faith for that kind of reunion.&nbsp;And with all her own trials, she handed a cheering present of Rexburg chocolates to my wife as we left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have seen in my visit here assures me that the lofty goal of creating a community of learners changed by the Atonement &mdash;blessed by the Holy Ghost &mdash; is possible.&nbsp;It seems far above us, but it is in our reach with the Lord's lifting hand. It is He&nbsp;that has set the path before us. It is He that knows our hearts and our eternal potential.&nbsp;He put the University and the temple on this hill.&nbsp;Nephi gave us the encouragement to move upward in faith with these words:</p>
<p>But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfillment of&nbsp;his words, and thus it is, Amen. (1 Nephi 9:6)</p>
<p>So, I am sure that by aligning ourselves with the Lord's purposes we will, with His power, reach the lofty goals He has given us. Yet I have the concern that many times in the past people have acted to remove themselves from his lifting power.&nbsp;One source of that tragedy is forgetting others and the Savior, who has atoned for their sins.&nbsp;It is too easy to think we can climb alone and that we move up on our own power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord warned me about that years ago, when I was the young college president here.&nbsp;Ed Wiliams invited my oldest son to join him and other geology teachers and students to climb the South Teton.&nbsp;My son was ten years old.&nbsp;I had climbed many mountains before.&nbsp;I wanted to prove I could still do it, and I wanted that sense of victory for my son.&nbsp;Just four hundred feet from the summit, my son seemed tired.&nbsp;I could tell he was exhausted.&nbsp;All my drive to succeed urged me upwards.&nbsp;But there was something about the spot where we stood on a sunlit place, which made me say to the others, "You go on to the summit.&nbsp;I will stay here with my son."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is years later that I have come to understand why that wait with my son for the others to come back down was so satisfying and why I had such a feeling of success when we reached the bottom after dark.&nbsp;The climbs to the places God would have us go are never for us alone.&nbsp;If we forget that, we will not have His full power to lift us. Somehow the Lord let me feel that day in the mountains that the summit for me was on that sunlit place where I could set up our little stove and share hot soup with my son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Losing sight of that need to climb with others could slow our progress toward dramatically improved teaching and learning.&nbsp;For instance, it would be easy to look for ways to help learners learn alone, using the wonders of technology. The same technology could give learners the experience of helping others they love to learn with them.&nbsp;Similarly, it would be tempting to increase the reported number of temple ordinances without regard to whether the patron was having the experience of lifting a loved one who died without the chance to claim the blessings of the temple.&nbsp;The summit of salvation, or joy in families in the Celestial Kingdom, is not reachable alone.&nbsp;That is what the Lord wants for us and our families.&nbsp;To have the help of His power, we must never forget that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to disqualify ourselves for his lifting power is to begin to act as if we have climbed on our power alone.&nbsp;It has been in the nature of men and women from the creation to begin to ignore what God has done and to exaggerate what they have done.&nbsp;That begins to happen in the good times.&nbsp;We can easily start to think that we created prosperity with our own labors and wisdom.&nbsp;We start calling attention to our accomplishments.&nbsp;We pray for help less often and with less fervor.&nbsp;And so the Lord's power lessens in our lives.&nbsp;In time we can be left more and more to our own power.&nbsp;That danger is all the greater here because you are being prospered, and you will be prospered even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best prevention for that drift to forgetting others and taking undue credit is clear.&nbsp;You promise to do it each time you renew your baptismal covenant in taking the sacrament:&nbsp;"Always remember Him."&nbsp;He is our exemplar.&nbsp;He did what He did for His Father and for His Father's children.&nbsp;He gave credit to His Father for the blessing of the harvest.&nbsp;Because I know that you will do the very best you can to keep your covenants, I am sure the great blessings you seek in this University and this temple will be granted. And so I am confident that you can avoid the hazards of selfishness and pride, which would decrease your access to the power of the Lord to lift you on your climb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that God the Father lives and loves you.&nbsp;His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ,&nbsp;atoned for our sins and broke the bands of death.&nbsp;The Holy Ghost has testified to all of us of&nbsp;truth, of hope, and of the joy of the pure love of God.&nbsp;I leave you my blessing that you may by the power of the Holy Ghost see the course God has set before you and feel the confidence that you are lifted by His power and surrounded by His love on the journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for that gracious introduction.&nbsp; I am happy to be here with you today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember when I was a student in college.&nbsp;Like some of you, I had trouble deciding what my major should be.&nbsp; First I thought about majoring in economics.&nbsp;That way, if I couldn't get a job after I graduated, at least I would understand why.</p>
<p>Then I thought I might major in physical education.&nbsp;I went down to the gym to lift weights, but the laughter made it difficult to concentrate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sampled some classes, but I didn&rsquo;t always do very well.&nbsp;Once I took a geography test that asked, &ldquo;What is the capital of Wyoming?&rdquo;&nbsp; I wrote, &ldquo;The capital of Wyoming is W.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also took a photography class.&nbsp;I just about went crazy trying to take a close-up of the horizon.&nbsp;The teacher in that class gave me an F-minus.&nbsp;He said that giving me an F would be unfair to the people who failed normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I studied chemistry, but I thought that there were only four elements on the periodic table: earth, air, fire, and water. I thought that fire has three electrons in the outer shell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought about studying math, but I couldn&rsquo;t grasp the concept. I do feel that it&rsquo;s important to understand math.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been reported that 60 percent of Americans cannot do basic math.&nbsp; Sixty percent!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s nearly half!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I considered studying a foreign language.&nbsp;But I thought, if we were intended to learn a foreign language, then how come the Bible was originally written in English?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, I would like to speak about the joy of education and lifelong learning.&nbsp;Life is a test, and life is also a school.&nbsp; The Lord has invited us to seek learning.&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;[S]eek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&rdquo;<a href="#2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;He commanded early Church leaders to &ldquo;study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson has said, &ldquo;Your talents will expand as you study and learn. You will be able to better assist your families in their learning, and you will have peace of mind in knowing that you have prepared yourself for the eventualities that you may encounter in life.&rdquo;<a href="#4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley taught young people,</p>
<p>You belong to a church that teaches the importance of education.&nbsp; You have a mandate from the Lord to educate your minds and your hearts and your hands.&nbsp;The Lord has said,&nbsp; "Teach ye diligently . . . of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms&mdash;that ye may be prepared in all things" (D&amp;C 88:78-80).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mind you, these are not my words. These are the words of the Lord who loves you.&nbsp; He wants you to train your minds and hands to become an influence for good as you go forward with your lives. And as you do so and as you perform honorably and with excellence, you will bring honor to the Church, for you will be regarded as a man or woman of integrity and ability and conscientious workmanship.<sup><a href="#5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>It is a great privilege for you to study at Brigham Young University - Idaho.&nbsp;BYU-Idaho plays an important role in higher education.&nbsp; Religiously-affiliated institutions of higher education help serve the needs of many people and increase the pluralism and diversity among universities.&nbsp;Michael W. McConnell has observed that religious universities contribute to the &ldquo;ethical, cultural, and intellectual life of our nation.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is consistent with the principles of the gospel.&nbsp;Being a student here is a position of trust.&nbsp;As you know, the Church pays for much of your education.&nbsp;You have the responsibility to study hard, to observe the standards of the university, and to prepare yourself for future service.&nbsp;Hopefully, throughout your life you will look back on your time here with fondness, and you will cherish the memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people in the world do not have the same opportunities for education that you have.&nbsp;It is important to be grateful for the opportunities, and to use them wisely.&nbsp;I would like to offer some advice as you pursue your education here. I hope that in doing so I don&rsquo;t sound like Polonius to Laertes in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play, <em>Hamlet</em>&mdash;especially when I remember what happened to Polonius. I&rsquo;m not referring to the fact that he was killed behind the arras, but rather that over the centuries he has been portrayed by literally thousands of bad actors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, you might recall a story about a person who was asked to build a house.&nbsp;He decided to cut corners, use cheap materials, and do a poor job.&nbsp;When he was done, the owner handed him the key, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give you this house as a gift.&rdquo;&nbsp;Attending the university is like that.&nbsp;You can work hard and do a good job.&nbsp;Or you can cut corners and do a poor job. Either way, you&rsquo;re the person who will live in the house for the rest of your life.&nbsp;Your education will enable you to serve others and to provide a living for you and your family.&nbsp;When you graduate, you will receive the key.&nbsp;You will have built your own &ldquo;house of learning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oddly, in education some people want to get less than what they pay for.&nbsp;The reason is that, while one cost is tuition, an additional</p>
<p>cost is the work required to learn.&nbsp;If you decide not to work hard, not only will you cheat yourself, but also you will affect others who will depend on you, including your family and the people whom you will serve.&nbsp;I encourage you to work diligently, to learn a lot, and to prepare well for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, try to do things that enrich your education, like doing an internship, working in student government, writing for the school newspaper or another publication, or belonging to a student club that focuses on a particular interest. Perhaps you can be a tutor or a teaching assistant, or participate in a performing group.&nbsp;When you look back on your time here, those special experiences will stand out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell my students that when I was in high school I was on the chess team.&nbsp;I tell them that I had a rook on my letterman&rsquo;s jacket.&nbsp;Do you know what it says when you walk into the cafeteria with a rook on your letterman&rsquo;s jacket?&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess with me, pal.&nbsp; Checkmate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, make time for service.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to fulfill Church callings and to perform other service.&nbsp;Service is important for its own sake, and it helps you to keep a broader perspective and to stay balanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, become friends with other students.&nbsp;Even though your classmates are not as good-looking as you are, most of them are bright, good, and interesting people.&nbsp;The friendships you make can last throughout your whole life, and can be a particularly sweet aspect of your university experience.&nbsp;Take time to make friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I didn&rsquo;t have many friends. Once I told my dad that the other kids were giving me a hard time about my religion.&nbsp;My father sat down next to me, and in his fatherly way, he said, &ldquo;Son, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what race you are or what religion you are.&nbsp;There will always be people who don&rsquo;t like you.&nbsp; Because you&rsquo;re irritating.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, enjoy your university education.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s exciting, fascinating, challenging, and fun.&nbsp;The secret to happiness is not to look forward to some future time when all your problems will be solved.&nbsp;The secret is to be happy today.&nbsp;There is joy in learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some Hebrew schools a special ceremony occurs on the first day of class. The teacher places a drop of honey on the cover of a book and gives the book to the student, who licks the honey off.&nbsp;The symbolic message is that learning is sweet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your university education is a wonderful time of preparation for the future.&nbsp;You have a mission in life.&nbsp;That mission has multiple dimensions.&nbsp;You have agency to choose your life&rsquo;s work and goals.&nbsp;Your education will help you to accomplish those goals, and to fulfill your mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully your university education will provide a foundation for a lifelong learning. Two reasons that we should continue to learn are to grow and to increase out capacity to serve others.&nbsp;Brigham Young said, &ldquo;Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#7" target="_self">7 </a></sup>&nbsp;Elder Dallin H. Oaks and Sister Kristen M. Oaks have written, &ldquo;As Latter-day Saints we believe in education, and we have a philosophy about how and why we should pursue it.&nbsp; Our religious faith teaches us that we should seek learning by the Spirit and that we have a stewardship to use our knowledge for the benefit of mankind.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also wrote, &ldquo;There are few things more fulfilling and fun than learning something new.&nbsp;Great happiness, satisfaction, and financial rewards come from this. An education is not limited to formal study. Lifelong learning can increase our ability to appreciate and relish the workings and beauty of the world around us. This kind of learning goes well beyond books and a selective use of new technology, such as the Internet.&nbsp;It includes artistic endeavors.&nbsp;It also includes experiences with people and places: conversations with friends, visits to museums and concerts, and opportunities for service. We should expand ourselves and enjoy the journey.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#9" target="_self">9</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important and fulfilling area of lifelong learning is gospel study.&nbsp;It is important to read the scriptures often, so that they become part of our lives.&nbsp;Reading the scriptures reminds us of the Lord&rsquo;s commandments, the covenants that we have made to keep them, and the blessings of the gospel.&nbsp; Reading the scriptures also invites the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Spirit guides our decisions and helps us to learn. Elder Russell M. Nelson said, &ldquo;Faith is nurtured through knowledge of God. It comes from prayer and feasting upon the words of Christ through diligent study of the scriptures.&rdquo;<a href="#10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Marion G. Romney, a former member of the First Presidency, told this story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few years ago as I began to practice law, members of my family were a little uneasy. They were afraid I would lose my faith.&nbsp; I wanted to practice law, but I had an even greater desire to keep my testimony, and so I decided upon a little procedure which I recommend to you. For thirty minutes each morning before I began the day&rsquo;s work I read from the Book of Mormon&mdash;I also read from all the other standard works of the Church, but I am talking now about the Book of Mormon&mdash;and in just a few minutes a day I read the Book of Mormon through, every year, for nine years. I know that it kept me in harmony, so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the Lord.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The Aaronic Priesthood Commitment states, &ldquo;I will obtain as much education as possible.&rdquo; One of the Young Women values is &ldquo;Knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; These things are not limited to formal education.&nbsp;We can be lifelong learners.&nbsp;We can read good books. We can read a newspaper and keep up on current events.&nbsp; We can take institute and other classes.&nbsp;Continual learning helps us to increase our understanding and to live a fuller and richer life. It helps us to improve as participants and leaders in our families, in the Church, and in civic affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidently, a study showed that only 25 percent of Americans can name at least two of the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.&nbsp;By contrast, more than half can name at least two members of the Simpsons.<a href="#12" target="_self"><sup>12 </sup></a>&nbsp;Personally, I don&rsquo;t think you should be allowed to vote unless you can name at least three members of the Simpsons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of one&rsquo;s opportunities for formal education, a person can engage in lifelong learning.&nbsp;This wrench belonged to my grandfather. He was only able to go to school through the eighth grade.&nbsp;He worked as a mechanic.&nbsp;He brought books about diesel engines home from work, and he read them.&nbsp;Eventually he became the supervisor over all the diesel equipment for a company in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although his opportunity for formal education was limited, he kept learning on his own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the joy of learning. For example, I have always enjoyed words.&nbsp;When I was a boy, and I would encounter a word I didn&rsquo;t know, sometimes I would ask my father what it meant. He would often reply, &ldquo;Look it up.&rdquo;&nbsp;My father usually knew the answer, but he wanted me to learn how to look words up.&nbsp;So I would open the dictionary on the bookshelf and look the word up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later I wanted to learn more words. One summer a friend and I worked as groundskeepers at the Oakland California Temple.&nbsp;On some days we would each write five words and their definitions on a 3-by-5 card, and put the card in our shirt pocket.&nbsp;Then, we would share the words and use them in sentences during the day.&nbsp;My favorite word from that summer was &ldquo;halcyon.&rdquo;&nbsp;It means calm, peaceful, tranquil, or golden.&nbsp;As we pulled weeds and performed other physical labor, we would exclaim, &ldquo;Oh, those halcyon days of youth.&rdquo;&nbsp;Now, as I look back, I see that they really were halcyon days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also like oxymorons.&nbsp;Oxymorons are self-contradicting phrases.&nbsp;For example, jumbo shrimp. Professional wrestling.&nbsp;Fun run.&nbsp;Reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I like collective nouns. A group of lions is called a pride.&nbsp;A group of geese is a gaggle. There are also a pod of whales, a shrewdness of apes, and a crash of rhinos. We could think of other possibilities. How about a complex of psychiatrists, or a glut of lawyers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example involving learning is music.&nbsp;Some time ago I decided to try to learn more about classical music.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s said that a sign of sophistication is being able to listen to the <em>William Tell Overture</em> without thinking of the Lone Ranger. I fail the test.&nbsp;To learn more, I purchased old recordings of classical music at Deseret Industries.&nbsp;I also learned a little about various composers. It took me a while to appreciate the music of Richard Wagner.&nbsp;Mark Twain said about Richard Wagner&rsquo;s music, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; I still don&rsquo;t know very much about classical music, but it has become a great source of enjoyment for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does one make time to continue learning?&nbsp;I believe in consistent incremental progress&mdash;small steps over time.&nbsp;There is an old saying: &ldquo;By the yard, it&rsquo;s hard; but by the inch, it&rsquo;s a cinch.&rdquo;&nbsp;For example, a person does not learn to play the piano in a single day.&nbsp;One must practice daily for several years.&nbsp;After many small increments, one can eventually play hymns, popular songs, or classical music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lifelong learning is like that.&nbsp;We can create some time each day to study the scriptures.&nbsp;We can also read a little in other books each day.&nbsp;This relates to the concept of &ldquo;line upon line&rdquo; and &ldquo;precept upon precept.&rdquo;<a href="#13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a> President Wilford Woodruff said, &ldquo;Do not be discouraged because you cannot learn all at once; learn one thing at a time, learn it well, and treasure it up, then learn another truth and treasure that up, and in a few years you will have a great store of useful knowledge which will not only be a great blessing to yourselves and your children, but to your fellow men.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#14" target="_self">14&nbsp;</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love to read. I tell my students that my first job was as a proofreader in an M&amp;M factory.&nbsp;Groucho Marx said, &ldquo;Outside of a dog, a book is a man&rsquo;s best friend.&nbsp;Inside of a dog, it&rsquo;s too dark to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take a bus to and from work, and this time is my reading time.&nbsp;Also, as I mentioned previously, I like classical music, but I don&rsquo;t want to take the time to sit and listen to a recording.&nbsp;Instead, I play classical music while I get ready for work in the morning.&nbsp;The reading and the listening involve short periods each day.&nbsp;However, over time, the minutes add up to many hours of enjoyable reading and listening to music, and these things enrich the quality of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example involves a book group.&nbsp;For more than twenty years my wife Nadine and I have belonged to a book group with some friends.&nbsp;During the school year, we meet about monthly.&nbsp;We take turns: a couple chooses a book, hosts the book group in their home, leads the discussion, and serves refreshments afterwards.&nbsp;We have read books about gospel principles, biography, science, and other topics, and we have read novels and poetry.&nbsp;I had never heard of many of these books before, but I have enjoyed reading them very much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If lifelong learning is a priority, you will choose your own ways to make time for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like everything that is worthwhile, lifelong learning requires effort.&nbsp; We invest time, money, and hard work to learn.&nbsp;Is it worth it?&nbsp;We might consider the words of former Harvard University President Derek Bok.&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.&rdquo;&nbsp;Also, there is joy in learning.&nbsp;It helps us to grow and progress, to develop personally, to expand our minds, and to increase our wisdom and judgment.&nbsp;It helps us to prepare in additional ways to serve our Heavenly Father and his children.&nbsp;Elder and Sister Oaks wrote, &ldquo;The acquisition of knowledge is a lifelong, sacred activity, pleasing to our Father in Heaven and favored by His servants.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two issues connected with learning about which we must be careful. First, learning can lead to pride. In Second Nephi, Jacob wrote:&nbsp;</p>
<p>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.&nbsp;But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.<sup><a href="#16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;President Ezra Taft Benson taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pride is the universal sin, the great vice. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The antidote for pride is humility&ndash;meekness, submissiveness. It is the broken heart and contrite spirit. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God will have a humble people.&nbsp;Either we can choose to be humble or we can be compelled to be humble.&nbsp;Alma said, "Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us choose to be humble.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#17" target="_self">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Humility is a key virtue for a lifelong learner.&nbsp;Humility generates learning, while thinking that we already know all the answers interferes with our learning.&nbsp;Humility also prevents us from setting ourselves up as a light that competes with or contradicts the truths and authority of the gospel.&nbsp;All of us have much to learn.&nbsp;Will Rogers said, &ldquo;You know everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#18" target="_self">18</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, we should expect that at times apparent conflicts may arise between our academic disciplines and the gospel. Often secular disciplines approach issues differently than the gospel does.&nbsp;The story is told of a philosophy professor who died and went to heaven.&nbsp;Saint Peter asked, &ldquo;I see that you were a philosopher. Can you state a truth that you learned through your study of philosophy?&rdquo; The man thought for a few minutes.&nbsp;Then he said, &ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what.&nbsp; You state a truth, and I&rsquo;ll show you how to rebut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gospel encompasses all truth.<sup><a href="#19" target="_self">19</a></sup> President George Albert Smith said, &ldquo;I want to say that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accepts all that is true in the world from whatever source it may come, with the knowledge that it originates form the greatest of all scientists, our Father in Heaven.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#20" target="_self">20</a></sup> Internationally renowned scientist Henry Eyring wrote, &ldquo;The gospel, then, is the search for truth, and there is only one truth&mdash;there is a God in Heaven, who, if He is God over the world and the universe, certainly understands everything, and inside His mind there must be no contradiction.&rdquo;<a href="#21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When human knowledge and the gospel appear to conflict, we should remember that human knowledge is limited.&nbsp;Eternal truth is not limited, but our understanding of it is limited.&nbsp;After this life, if we are worthy, we will understand all truth.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we seek answers to faithful questions.&nbsp;We study, we ponder, we pray, we have patience, and we work hard.&nbsp; We exercise faith in God.&nbsp; He blesses us with greater knowledge, understanding, and peace in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell said, &ldquo;In my own education . . . I found that the basic gospel truths . . . could be harmonized with the great secular truths. &nbsp;[And] those gospel truths which, for the moment, could not be harmonized could . . . be regarded expectantly, for, ultimately, all truths belong to the gospel.&nbsp; Not all theories . . . but all truths.&nbsp;To so realize was an emancipating feeling then, and is now, for the feeling has never diminished, only increased.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#22" target="_self">22</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should be humble about what we know and what we do not know.&nbsp;An angel appeared to Nephi.&nbsp;Nephi wrote, &ldquo;And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?&nbsp;And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#23" target="_self">23</a> </sup>None of us knows all things, but we do know that God loves His children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s wisdom supersedes human knowledge.&nbsp;Elder Oaks has written, &ldquo;We are commanded to seek learning by study, the way of reason, and by faith, the way that relies on revelation. Both are pleasing to God.&nbsp; He uses both ways to reveal light and knowledge to his children.&nbsp;But when it comes to a knowledge of God and the principles of his gospel, we must give primacy to revelation because that is the Lord&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should also remember to put the gospel, not our academic discipline or our educational accomplishments, first in our lives.&nbsp;President Spencer W. Kimball, writing about idols, observed, &ldquo;Intangible things make just as ready gods.&nbsp;Degrees and letters and titles can become idols.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#24" target="_self">24 </a>&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#25" target="_self">25</a></sup>&nbsp; He also said, &ldquo;But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.&rdquo;<a href="#26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A faithful scholar needs to have charity. &ldquo;[C]harity is the pure love of Christ.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#27" target="_self">27</a></sup>&nbsp;It is the kind of love that the Savior has for us.<sup><a href="#28" target="_self">28</a></sup> It is Christ-like love.&nbsp;Paul wrote, &ldquo;Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, &nbsp;. . . seeketh not her own, &nbsp;. . . rejoiceth in the truth. &nbsp;Charity never faileth . . . .&rdquo;<a href="#29" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp; It has been said that people don&rsquo;t care how much you know until they know how much you care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we become parents, we should create an environment of learning for our children.&nbsp;One of the challenges in rearing children is that they tend to be like us.&nbsp;I had a parent-teacher conference with my son&rsquo;s teacher.&nbsp;She said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very bright.&rdquo;&nbsp;I said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;He has a lot of potential.&rdquo;&nbsp;I said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;But sometimes his mind tends to wander.&rdquo;&nbsp;I said, [pause] &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we help children to experience the joy of learning? One thing we can do is to read to them. When I was young, I was blessed that my parents read to me.&nbsp; My favorite book was a children&rsquo;s book called <em>My Puppy</em>.&nbsp;(Here is a re-issued copy of the book.)&nbsp;It was about a cute little puppy with big brown eyes.&nbsp;My father jokingly says that when he read the book to me, we both cried. I cried because I loved the book so much, and he cried because he hated the book so much.&nbsp;Both&nbsp; of my parents have always read a great deal, and they both read to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time spent reading to our children is precious.&nbsp; Strickland Gillilian wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have tangible wealth untold;</p>
<p>Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold.</p>
<p>Richer than I you can never be&mdash;</p>
<p>I had a mother who read to me.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#30" target="_self">30</a></sup></p>
<p>President Hinckley said, &ldquo;Begin early in exposing children to books. . . .&nbsp; It takes time, yes, much of it.&nbsp;It takes self-discipline.&nbsp;It takes organizing and budgeting the minutes and hours of the day.&nbsp;But it will never be a bore as you watch young minds come to know characters, expressions, and ideas.&nbsp; Good reading can become a love affair, far more fruitful in long term effects than many other activities in which children use their time. . . .</p>
<p>Parents, work at the matter of creating an atmosphere in your homes. Let your children be exposed to great minds, great ideas, everlasting truth, and those things which will build and motivate for good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. . . I wish to urge every parent within the sound of my voice to try to create within your home an atmosphere of learning and the growth which will come of it.<sup><a href="#31" target="_self">31</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants, it says that &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; is &ldquo;light and truth.&rdquo;<a href="#32" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a> It also says, &ldquo;Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.&nbsp;And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#33" target="_self">33</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that it says that intelligence is obtained through diligence and obedience.&nbsp; That is an important principle.&nbsp;In the very next verses, it says:</p>
<p>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated&mdash;And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.<sup><a href="#34" target="_self">34</a></sup></p>
<p>If we do our best, God will strengthen us beyond our natural abilities and will bless us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a wonderful time to be on the earth.&nbsp;There are so many opportunities for learning, growth, and service.&nbsp;I hope that we will strive to use our disciplines in our discipleship, and to use our talents to serve the human family and to serve God.&nbsp;President Kim B. Clark has summarized the mission of BYU-Idaho with two words: &ldquo;disciple&rdquo; and &ldquo;leader.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#35" target="_self">35</a></sup> Education and lifelong learning can help us to develop as disciples and leaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a testimony of the gospel.&nbsp;I testify that Heavenly Father lives and loves us, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world.&nbsp;The gospel is true.&nbsp; I am grateful that the gospel emphasizes learning.&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>
In February of 1978, (more than&nbsp;thirty years ago) I stood at this pulpit and shared with the students, faculty, and staff of Ricks College the feelings of my heart. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My prayer for all of us today is the same as it was in 1978 ... it is like the prayer of many of your parents and leaders. It is the prayer of King David for his son Soloman recorded in 1 Chron 29:19: 
</p>
<p>
	And Give unto my son Solomon a perfect heart - to keep my commandments. 
	</p>
<p>
Those who love you and all who teach and direct you at this institution realize that it is when you follow the Savior with a perfect heart and keep His commandments, that you will find a life of true joy and happiness. There is no other way! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I am happy to be back here.&nbsp;It is good to be with you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The first time I was on this campus in an official capacity was in the fall of 1970. I was then the Associate Commissioner of the Church Educational System and the Secretary to the Church Board of Education and Ricks College Board of Trustees.&nbsp;I was accompanying Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who had just been called by the First Presidency to be the Commissioner of the newly reorganized Church Educational System.&nbsp;President Joseph Fielding Smith and President Harold B. Lee had asked Brother Maxwell to visit this campus and express their appreciation to President John Clark and his associates for all of the excellent work that they had done and were doing here.&nbsp;President Clark had served for more than&nbsp;twenty-six years as President of Ricks College through some very trying times. During those years, he had seen the student body increase from about 200 to almost 5200 students. He was doing his work on a very limited budget and with limited facilities. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1970, it was time for President Clark to retire. Elder Maxwell informed the faculty and the staff that the Lord was very interested in the future of this institution and that a search was underway for a person to replace President Clark. As Secretary to the Board of Trustees, I watched as the brethren considered and approved Henry B. Eyring to be the President of this college. You, of course, know him today as President Eyring of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All I can say - that was surely an inspired choice. Following President Eyring, the Lord called a number of great brethren to lead this institution as it is changing from a rather small and insignificant Southern Idaho college to what it is to become ... it will become one of the country&#39;s most unique and outstanding institutions of higher education. (To give you an idea of what I think is to come, Brother Carl G. Maeser said, &quot;We may go to the East for learning; but the East will come to the West for wisdom.&quot;) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Eyring was followed by President Bruce C. Hafen, who was followed by President Joe J. Christenson, followed by President Steven Bennion, and then President David A. Bednar was called as president. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These brethren were all great educators, but, more importantly, they are great priesthood holders and leaders of the Church. Each is blessed with an outstanding testimony of the mission of the Church and of this institution, and they followed the inspiration of the Lord and the direction of the Prophets as they did their work. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Recently the Lord, through his Prophet, has called President Kim B. Clark to lead this institution ... you must be aware that there is hardly an institution of higher education&nbsp;in this country that would not have rejoiced if Brother Clark would have consented to lead their institution. But he followed his Prophet&#39;s call and how blessed we are and will be because he is here. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that through this same period of time, the Lord has also directed the gathering of the most qualified and spiritual faculty and staff to assist President Clark in seeing that each of you is given an opportunity to have an outstanding educational and spiritual experience while you are here. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Lord is now using a large amount of tithing and other resources to make this college the kind of an institution He wants it to be. According to the Lord&#39;s instruction in section 119 of the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the main uses of the tithing resources of the Church is for the &quot;Laying of the foundation of Zion.&quot; When you read the 120<sup>th</sup> section of the D&amp;C, you will see that it is the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric that are involved in making these decisions. They are not the only ones involved in these decisions. As the D&amp;C states, &quot;it is the voice of the Lord unto them&quot; (D&amp;C 120) that guides these brethren in the work of allocating these sacred funds. It is my testimony to you that the Lord is guiding this work in the way He has said He would. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Because of some of my past assignments, I was blessed to be in many meetings when budgets and expenditures were being discussed. I witnessed the Lord making His will known to these Brethren over and over again as they approved the use of Church resources. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to be involved in such an institution and such an important work. Remember, the investment that the Lord makes in this college in your behalf is to help you be leaders in the work of laying the foundation of Zion while you are on the earth. You are being trained to be leaders in your homes and in the world after you have left this institution. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brother Karl G. Maeser, who founded BYU Academy under the direction of Brigham Young said, 
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of the establishment of schools in which religious instruction could be given was to combat the invasion of unbelief, skepticism, moral deficiencies and other objectionable influences which are present in this society. 
	</p>
<p>
We have much more evil and many more objectionable influences in our society and in our lives today than in the time of Brother Maeser. We are to help combat these evils and to do a good job of it, because of our experience at BYU-Idaho. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I have reviewed some of the background and purposes of BYU-Idaho to help you see what it is becoming and to suggest that each of you is to become a leader in building Zion on the earth. There is one thing you can be sure of - this institution will still be changing in the years to come as it becomes more perfect in the performance of its mission. You should change and grow in a like manner. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Remember that the Lord has told us that we will be judged by what we have become as a result of our experiences&nbsp;while we live on this earth. We need to remember His instruction to us - remember, He asks us, &quot;therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Even as I Am.&quot; (3 Nephi 27:27). This should be our goal. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
May I share with you some lessons that have been important lessons in my life and that have helped me to become different than I might otherwise have been? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We have all been taught that it is impossible for men to be saved in ignorance (D&amp;C 131:6). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We are all reminded that &quot;whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come&quot; (D&amp;C 130: 18-19).&nbsp; &quot;And we have been taught that the glory of God is intelligence, or in other words light and truth&quot; (D&amp;C 93: 36). The Book of Mormon defines truth as follows: &quot;... the spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be ...&quot; (Jacob 4:13). Truth, then, is knowing things as they really are, not as they may appear. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At the same time, we are reminded &quot;to be learned is good, if they hearken unto the counsels of God&quot; (2 Nephi 9:29). Remember the <strong>IF</strong>! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We do need to study and seek diligently and then, through the Lord&#39;s spirit, we can be led to the truths that help us use what we have learned in ways that help us become what we are to become. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Please remember this word of counsel from the Lord through apostle John A. Widsoe (Joseph Smith p.221), 
</p>
<p>
	The children of men are expected to use their own powers in all their affairs. The gathering of knowledge is no exception. Only when man has gone as far as he can, and more knowledge is required, does the Lord come with direct help. 
	</p>
<p>
Perhaps this process is a little like we are taught about being saved in the Book of Mormon. &quot;It is by grace that we are saved - after all we can do&quot; (2 Nephi 25:22). You will not be given the answers to your questions if you do not first do all you can to find the answers. After you do all that you can, then you should go to the Lord and ask for verification by the Holy Spirit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As an aside, just remember the little saying, &quot;Work will win when wishy washy wishing won&#39;t&quot; It is a great lesson to learn to work hard. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To illustrate my next suggestion, may I share a personal story with you? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I was aware of the Lord&#39;s counsel concerning seeking to learn and grow. My parents and grandparents had taught me to work hard and I was living my life like I thought I should live it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1963, when the world was less hectic and I was much younger, I had an experience that helped to change my life. I had completed my college degree, served in the army during the Korean War, and had returned home to Northern Utah. I had worked for a CPA firm, received my CPA license, and then after, some time and experience, I was finally working for a company in a small Utah city. We were satisfied and happy. Life was just as we had planned it would be. I had an important and well-paying position, and, as far as I was concerned, I had reached my professional goals. Then the Lord took a more active part in changing my life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I was called to be ordained a Seventy. (Those were the days when the Seventies were ordained in each Stake).&nbsp;Elder Boyd K. Packer (now President Boyd K. Packer) who was then an assistant to the Twelve, was assigned to our stake conference. During his visit, he was to interview those to be ordained, and then after the conference, to ordain us in our Priesthood calling. It was the interview and the blessing that I received from Elder Packer that began to change my life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As a part of a very powerful blessing, Elder packer blessed me that I would be &quot;blessed with the spirit of divine discontent.&quot; He indicated that I should not and would not be content with what I was doing in my life unless I was doing all I could to &quot;be about the Lord&#39;s work in the earth by serving my brothers and sisters to the best of my ability.&quot; Now that is the kind of a blessing that gives you a great deal to consider. It dawned on me later that he was reminding me of the Lord&#39;s command to &quot;seek ye first the kingdom of heaven.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I continued to work in that community and was, after a time, called to be the bishop of the ward at a young age. I thought that I was responding to the blessing. I was doing all I could do to serve my brothers and sisters in the ward, and we were happy as a family in where we were living and what we were doing. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But ... I was not content! I felt that there was something else I should be doing. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It just so happened that in about 1965 or 1966, the Church announced in the Church News that it had an opening in the position of director of long-range planning. I applied. I did not even get a response to my application. In fact, I was not qualified and I knew it, but I was worried about that Priesthood blessing. To make a long story much shorter, it was seventeen years later, after many small miracles in my life, that I was asked by the First Presidency to assume the responsibility to coordinate the long-range planning efforts of the Church. This was the very work I had expressed interest in many years before. During those seventeen years, I had received many opportunities to be involved in the work of the Lord&#39;s kingdom and to utilize whatever talents the Lord had given me to do His work in the earth. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My suggestion is to listen to the Lord as He directs your life. Examine your patriarchal blessing, think of other blessings and council you have received and listen to the Spirit guiding you as you strive to be about His work on the earth. Do not be satisfied with your daily work or career unless you feel you are blessing others by the work you do. Remember the story of the rich young man as recorded in Mark 10:16-22. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The story of the rich young man is depicted in a picture that&#39;s in every temple in this Church. As the Lord taught that young man an answer to his question, &quot;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot; You remember that he told the Lord that he kept all of the commandments and he&#39;d done everything he thought he should do, and you remember what the scriptures record? The scriptures record that the Lord looked at him and loved him because he was who he was. But because He loved him, He gave him further instructions. And those instructions are contained in the last covenant you make in the holy temple of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To illustrate the next suggestion I would make today, I would share with you another story. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1967, when I was a very young controller at The University of Utah, still striving to follow the council of the Lord through Elder Packer, I was asked to meet with President Harold B. Lee in his office at Church headquarters.&nbsp;I had only met President Lee one brief time before that day. President Lee informed me that Brother Neal A. Maxwell, who had been appointed as the new commissioner of the Church Education System, had asked that I be called to be his new Associate Commissioner responsible for all finance, budgets, buildings, etc. in that world wide school system. President Lee asked me if I would accept the position. I told him that I would. He asked if I did not need to visit with Sister Andersen before making such a career change. I told him that I did not need to visit with Sister Andersen. We had decided together that we would always do whatever we were called to do in the Lord&#39;s kingdom. President Lee then asked if I needed to know how much the salary would be for that assignment. I told him no, I was sure that I would be satisfied with whatever arrangement he made in that regard. His response was very interesting. He said, &quot;Well, since you feel that way about it, I have some other assignments that I would like you to accept.&quot; He then outlined several other tasks that he wanted me to work on with him to help accomplish what he had in mind for the Church. That was just the beginning of some wonderful experiences with President Lee. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you about one such experience. One day, as I entered his office to ask him to sign some papers, he asked how things were going. The work that he had asked to be accomplished was not easy, in fact, in some cases, I wasn&#39;t sure I could get it done, and so I told him what I thought. Well ... his response was more interesting. He got up from his chair, went to the door of his office, told his secretary, whose name was Frances, to see that we were not disturbed and then closed the door. I could tell that Brother Andersen was going to the woodshed! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, you have read about the Brother of Jared being chastised by the Lord for three hours for not calling on Him in prayer as recorded in Ether 2:14. I hope you remember his experiences. He learned how much the Lord loved him and wanted to help him. Here I was, being chastised by the Prophet of the Lord and I was going to learn the same lessons. It was one of the sweetest occasions of my life. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Lee had me sit in a chair and then he laid his hands on my head and by the power of his Priesthood taught me the things that he felt I needed to know to accomplish the work that was to be done. He would bless me and teach me out of the Doctrine and Covenants, and then bless me and teach me again, and then bless me and teach me again. He was a master teacher and a loving friend. When he was finished, he asked me if I thought I could do what needed to be done. I told him that with that kind of help and understanding I was sure that I could get it done, and if I did not, it would be my fault, not his or the Lord&#39;s. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Here is the council I would leave with you today. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Never refuse a call to build up the kingdom of God in the earth or to help establish Zion. Be prepared in advance with a determination to always serve the Lord and along with your wife and family, put His work first in your life. Please be willing to accept whatever calls the Lord sends your way. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Thomas S. Monson teaches us that we can do anything that the Lord calls us to do. Remember His statements: &quot;who the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies&quot; or &quot;the Lord shapes the burden to fit the back of those who are to carry it.&quot; Believe what the Lord tells you through his modern-day Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. Part of being a covenant people is that we covenant to use our time to build up the kingdom of God on the earth. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Just in passing; as you receive any call to the position in the Church, take time to read the instructions in the handbooks as to how you are to do His work, or if you are a teacher, how to teach the lesson as contained in the lesson manual. I continue to be amazed at how many of us think that we know so much, that we have no need to read what has been prepared for us by the servants of the Lord to help us do the work in the Kingdom. Read the handbooks and lesson manuals and follow the instructions. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I have seen on a first-hand basis how hard the brethren work to be sure that we are instructed in ways that allow us to know how to fulfill any calling we are given or to teach any lesson in any class. Following the manuals is just like following the Lord.&nbsp;Or to say it another way, when you do not follow the manuals, you may have a very difficult time getting something done the way the Lord wants it done. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My final observation is that you should take advantage of the greatest opportunity the Lord has given to this generation ... that is to search out and learn the lessons that the Lord has prepared for each of us in His Holy House. To learn these lessons may take you much of your life but these are the most important lessons you can learn, and the Temple is the place the Lord has prepared for you to be taught. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
You have had many wonderful lessons taught at this pulpit on the blessings of the Temples. Let me add my testimony to those you have already heard. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
You are so blessed to be able to go to the Temple. Once you have your recommend, you can go about as easily as you can attend you various classes on the campus. The lessons you learn and the service you give in the House of the Lord are more important for your eternal progress than any lessons you may learn in the classrooms on this campus. (Do not use this as an excuse to miss any of your classes.)&nbsp;Although you have outstanding teachers and examples at this institution, consider who is to be your teacher in the Temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Remember the lesson contained in D&amp;C 84: 19-22: 
</p>
<p>
	And this greater Priesthood administereth the Gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the Kingdom even the key of the Knowledge of God. Therefore in the ordinances thereof, the power of Godliness is manifest. 
	</p>
<p>
	And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the Priesthood, the power of Godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh; For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father and live. 
	</p>
<p>
The most important lessons taught in the Temple are the lesson of service to others who cannot help themselves and those lessons contained within the Priesthood ordinances. Just like other lessons, these cannot be learned in a single exposure. You should not think of going through the Temple but of attending often enough to let the Temple go through you. Attend the Temple and learn as much as you can as often as you can. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Just a thought that may apply to some of you: a large number of Temple workers are required for a Temple to operate as they should. Temple workers have a great opportunity to learn as they serve. There may be times in your life when you desire to serve as ordinance workers in the Temple. Let your Bishop know if you think you could be a Temple worker. He will explain to you the conditions of such a call. If you are able to serve in the Temple, your life will be greatly enriched. More than you can imagine. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My experience in the Temple has taught me that I would have certainly been a better person, a better father and husband, a better missionary and a better Priesthood leader, if I would have understood the lessons of the Temple earlier in my life. I am convinced that there are a great many members of the Church who think that going through the Temple was all they had to do to receive the blessings of the Temple. I do not believe this is true. The lessons must be learned and the blessings earned. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To conclude, let me just quote one lesson from the Dedicatory Prayer of the Kirtland Temple that the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith as he prepared to dedicate that Temple. The same blessings are available in every Temple to every worthy son or daughter of our Heavenly Father. 
</p>
<p>
	And we ask Thee, Holy Father, that they servants may go forth from this house armed with Thy power, and that Thy name may be upon them, and Thy glory be round about them and thine angels have charge over them. And from this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings, in truth, unto the ends of the earth, that they may know that this is Thy work, and that Thou has put forth Thy hand to fulfill that which Thou hast spoken by the mouths of the Prophets, concerning the last days (D&amp;C 109:22-23). 
	</p>
<p>
These are desirable blessings for each of us to become what we are to become. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I pray that each of us will do those things we need to do to receive the blessing of the Temple and to continue becoming what we are to become. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I leave you my testimony.&nbsp;A testimony of the truthfulness of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ, a testimony of the great love our Heavenly Father has for each of us, a testimony of the divinity and majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ and His desire to have us all become &quot;like Him.&quot;&nbsp;May we become more like Him as we learn to learn, as we learn to serve, and as we learn to listen to the Lord and to grow. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I say these things in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, amen. 
</p>

Good afternoon brothers and sisters. I would like to begin by expressing gratitude to President and Sister Clark, as well as those who work with them, for the kindness and concern they have shown to my family. They truly are gracious hosts. Next I would like to recognize you for being here today and thank you for the goodness and commitment your presence represents. I never fail to be impressed as I look out over a group of you, either in class during the week or in church on Sunday, with your basic goodness and your desire to do that which is right. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
This is a humbling experience for me. I am somewhat comforted by the words of President J. Rueben Clark Jr., although delivered in a somewhat different context, when he said, &quot;One takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines.&quot;<a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a> Fortunately, my mother is listening today and she will think I did well no matter what I say. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
Nothing you hear today will be new; you have heard it all before. My prayer is that in hearing it again the Holy Ghost will carry it to your heart in a way specifically tailored to your needs and circumstances. My topic is the Prophet Joseph Smith and in reviewing certain experiences in his life I will make liberal use of the words of Church leaders to support my testimony, the research of Richard Bushman to establish the historical narrative, and the poetry of S. Dilworth Young to develop creative imagery. For my students who are here, especially those who are history majors, that means this paper will be based on secondary rather than primary sources and I have footnotes. I recommend to all of you a fuller study of the Prophet Joseph Smith, as I have not been able to include a &quot;hundredth part&quot; of what is available. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
Much of what I will say today will be presented in the form of a narrative, but I have thought much about the doctrines and principles I hope to convey through the narrative. There are two doctrines I wish you to keep in mind: first, Jesus Christ lives and directs His church here upon the earth, and second, the Savior prepares and calls living prophets to lead and direct His church. The two supporting principles I would like you to consider in connection with these doctrines are that the Savior knows and loves each one of us, His children, and that our individual experiences help us prepare to fulfill our divine callings here in mortality. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
I have had, for as long as I can remember, a testimony of Joseph Smith. A testimony that he was called of God as a Prophet, that he translated the gold plates into the Book of Mormon, that the Lord restored the true church of Christ through him, and that he did, as he said he did, see the Father and the Son in the now sacred grove. My patriarchal blessing promises me that gift of testimony and that promise was later reinforced by a stake president who set me apart as a stake missionary. I have never doubted that testimony, yet at times, like on my mission, I wondered at my supposed lack of a &quot;spiritual&quot; experience in connection with that testimony. That came, of all places, in a tractor cab on a hill not far to the east of here, but by then the experience became a simple reinforcement of what I already knew. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
My testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith is key to my testimony of the restored gospel. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
As President James E. Faust wrote, 
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr" align="left">
	To each true believer there must ultimately and finally come a conviction that Joseph Smith was a revealer of truth, a prophet of God. Each must be convinced that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ did appear to Joseph Smith and did commission him to reestablish the church of Christ upon the face of the earth.<a href="#2" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a><sup> </sup>
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr" align="left">
I&nbsp;have that testimony. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Joseph Smith was born nearly 204 years ago in a humble log cabin nestled among the granite mountains of Vermont. His family, consisting of his father Joseph Smith Sr., his mother Lucy, and eventually 10 brothers and sisters, had little in terms of worldly goods and their early years in Vermont found them on the edge between modest comfort and poverty. 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<br />
	In 1812 calamity struck. Typhoid fever swept through the upper Connecticut Valley and left 6,000 dead. One after another the Smith family fell ill, until all but the parents were [infected].<a href="#3" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<br />
	The fever left seven-year-old Joseph after two weeks, but a sore formed in his armpit and was wrongly diagnosed as a sprain. After two weeks of intense pain Dr. Parker identified the true cause of the suffering and lanced the sore. . . . Though that infection healed, Joseph complained immediately of a pain in his left shin and ankle. . . [A surgeon] was called in and . . . an eight-inch incision was made between ankle and knee. Opening the infection helped temporarily, but infection had now entered the bone. The doctor made another, larger incision, going down to the bone.<a href="#4" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>4 </sup></a>
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr" align="left">
<br />
	When the . . . wound began to swell once more, . . . [the doctor] consulted a &lsquo;council of surgeons,&#39; headed by Nathan Smith and Cyrus Perkins from the Dartmouth Medical College. They proposed amputation . . .&nbsp; Lucy refused to accept the idea of amputation, and . . . appealed to the doctors to cut out the diseased portion of the bone [instead]. Fortunately for . . . Joseph . . . Nathan Smith, in his extensive practice with typhoid patients suffering from bone infection, had developed [just such] a surgical procedure. . . <a href="#5" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
	As the operation began, Lucy went out into the fields and left Joseph, Jr., in his father&#39;s arms, the infected leg resting on folded sheets. The surgeons bored holes on each side of the leg bone and chipped off three large pieces. Joseph screamed when they broke off the first piece, and Lucy rushed back into the room. Sent away, she came back again as the third piece came off. Blood gushed from the open wound, and Joseph lay on the bed drenched in blood.<a href="#6" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
But the operation continued and succeeded.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
	After three months of constant pain Joseph had passed the crisis and the leg began to mend. . . . While the wound healed cleanly this time, fourteen additional pieces of bone worked their way to the surface. The disease and pain so wasted his body that his mother easily carried him about in her arms. Convalescence dragged on for three years ... To the end of his life he limped slightly, possibly because the trauma stunted the growth of the invaded leg.<a href="#7" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>7</sup> </a>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<br />
The fever and the long recovery period broke the Smiths financially. By 1814, they survived on the sale of fruit from their orchard, oil-cloth table coverings Lucy painted in her spare time, and the work Joseph Sr., found in town. The final straw was the growing season of 1816 that is still remembered in Vermont as the year without a summer. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
In search of a more secure economic future, the Smith&#39;s decided to leave Vermont and migrate to western New York. &quot;Thousands of other Vermonters made the same decision.&quot;<a href="#8" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a> Joseph Sr. left first and the family followed. By the time Lucy reached New York the family was so destitute that Lucy had been forced to sell bits of cloth and the children&#39;s medicine to pay for accommodations along the way.<a href="#9" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a> Looking back on these experiences it seems difficult to understand why young Joseph and his family should have to face such hardships. However, it also seems clear that there was a reason: Joseph&#39;s work did not lie in Vermont but in New York. 
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
By the time they arrived in New York, Joseph&#39;s family had already experienced the spirit of revivalism now known as the Second Great Awakening. But the move put them directly in the path of a wave of revivals between 1818 and 1820 in which the spirit of conversion burned so strongly that even today western New York is referred to as &quot;the burned over district.&quot; The Smith&#39;s had always been a religious family in practice and thought but had been reluctant to join themselves with any specific church. The New York revivals were strong enough to draw Lucy and some of the children to the Presbyterian Church. &quot;Joseph, Jr. &lsquo;became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect, and came close to joining, but could not overcome his reservations.&#39;&quot;<a href="#10" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>10 </sup></a>
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
	His mother remembered Joseph as a &lsquo;remarkably quiet, well-disposed child,&#39; &lsquo;much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of [the] children, but far more given to meditation and deep study.&#39;<a href="#11" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p align="left">
<br />
Joseph later wrote, 
</p>
<p align="left">
	From the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world, of mankind, the contentions and divisions the wickedness and abominations and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind. My mind became exceedingly distressed for I became convicted of my Sins and by searching the Scriptures I found mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the Gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own Sins and for the Sins of the world.<a href="#12" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<br />
The young Joseph, the future prophet, had questions. 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<strong>Questions </strong>
</p>
<p>
	How does one know when <br />
	Destiny begins a new course?<br />
	Who can tell when <br />
	Ordinary happenings, that is those <br />
	Which look ordinary, are <br />
	Portents of far reaching change? . . .<br />
	Is hell bottomless?<br />
	Does it endlessly burn, and <br />
	Sear, and torture without <br />
	Consuming? . . .<br />
	Of all the churches which is truly <br />
	That of God?<br />
	How does one know which pastor <br />
	Has the truth? . . .<br />
	Large questions for a boy of <br />
	Fourteen years! . . .<br />
	One night before the flickering fire <br />
	He read the words of James, <br />
	Apostle of the Lord: <br />
	If any of you lack wisdom, <br />
	Let him ask of God, that <br />
	Giveth to all men liberally <br />
	And upbraideth not; <br />
	But let him ask in faith. . . .<br />
	And faith sprang up <br />
	Within his heart, and <br />
	To himself he said:<br />
	I lack wisdom, <br />
	I am weak, <br />
	I will ask in faith. <a href="#13" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>13 </sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
Joseph later recounted, 
</p>
<p>
	So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. . . . It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all of my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally. . . . I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me . . . At the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair . . . I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head . . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages.<a href="#14" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>
	God spake! 
	</p>
<p>
	Release from darkness <br />
	Came with brilliant light.<br />
	Two Beings stood in air <br />
	Above his head.<br />
	Transcendent glory from Them shone <br />
	Their brilliance brighter than the sun. 
	</p>
<p>
	One spoke:<br />
	This is my Beloved Son, <br />
	Hear him! . . .<br />
	Gone now was fear,<br />
	Terror was no more.<br />
	The boy spake as a boy,<br />
	A simple question asked:<br />
	Which church is right?<br />
	Swift was the reply:<br />
	In my sight all have <br />
	Gone astray; <br />
	None are right.<a href="#15" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
<strong>Out Of The Forest</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Out of the forest came Joseph Smith, . . .<br />
	Threading his way toward home, <br />
	The cabin home, <br />
	The frontier cabin home; <br />
	Threading, too, his way, <br />
	His lonely way <br />
	Toward his destiny.<br />
	In such a simple way <br />
	Eternal work begins. <br />
	Could he stand true <br />
	To this work <br />
	Now revealed for him to do?<a href="#16" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>

Three years later, at the age now of 17, Joseph

He said &lsquo;that God had a work for [Joseph] to do&#39; and told him of an ancient record written on gold plates, which, when translated, became the Book of Mormon. The book contained a record of the fullness of the gospel. . . . Joseph was directed to obtain the record, buried near his family&#39;s home in a nearby hill, which is now called Cumorah. The next day, Joseph found the plates <a href="#17" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a><sup> </sup>

in the place that Moroni described.

After four years of preparation Joseph did receive the plates and began the work of translation. The work went slowly at first as Joseph learned the process of translation using the Urim and Thummin. Emma, his wife of less than a year, served as his first scribe. Later, a friend Martin Harris arrived and the speed of translation increased. By the middle of June 1828, Joseph and Martin had filled 116 pages with text translated from the plates. Martin, wishing to convince his wife that the work in which he was engaged was true, asked Joseph if he could show the manuscript to his wife. Joseph was reluctant but Martin persisted and suggested that Joseph inquire of the Lord. Twice the answer was no! But finally the Lord granted permission on the condition that Martin should show the manuscript only to his brother, his wife, his parents, and his wife&#39;s sister. Martin promised with a solemn oath and set off for home.<a href="#19" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>19 </sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
Joseph&#39;s mind turned to other pressing matters. He and Emma&#39;s first child was born the day after Martin left. The child died that same day and Joseph took over nursing Emma back to health. After two weeks Joseph&#39;s mind turned back to Martin. On the day appointed for Martin Harris to return the manuscript, 
</p>
<p>
	The morning hours dragged by, and he did not come. At half past twelve [Joseph&#39;s mother] reported, &lsquo;We saw [Martin Harris] walking with a slow and measured tread toward the house, his eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the ground. On coming to the gate, he stopped, instead of passing through, and got upon the fence, and sat there some time with his hat drawn over his eyes.&#39; When he finally came in and sat down . . . Martin &lsquo;took up his knife and fork as if he were going to use them, but he immediately dropped them.&#39; He pressed his hands upon his temples, and cried out, in a tone of deep anguish, &quot;Oh I have lost my soul! I have lost my soul!&quot; Joseph sprang up and demanded to know of the manuscript. &lsquo;Have you broken your oath, and brought down condemnation upon my head, as well as your own?&#39; &lsquo;Yes it is gone,&#39; replied Martin, &lsquo;and I know not where.&#39;<a href="#20" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
&nbsp;To say that Joseph felt sorry for the loss of the manuscript would be an understatement. He felt ashamed, embarrassed, devastated. He sobbed, grieved, and repented. The angel took back the plates and the interpreters. The Lord chastened Joseph: &quot;For behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words ... you should have been faithful.&quot;<a href="#21" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a> From that day forth Joseph&#39;s life was one of faithfulness and obedience. It was as if he had tasted the fruits of disobedience and resolved never to go there again whatever the sacrifice. As Elder Hales suggested, through Joseph&#39;s early experiences he &quot;&#39;increased in wisdom and stature&#39; and &lsquo;waxed strong in spirit.&#39;&quot;<a href="#22" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>22 </sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
Eventually the Lord accepted Joseph&#39;s repentance, the plates were returned, and the work of translation began again. This time with Oliver Cowdery as scribe. As Cowdery later wrote, &quot;These days were never to be forgotten. To sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom.&quot;<a href="#23" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>23</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
Between June 1828 and April 1830 the Book of Mormon translation was finished, heavenly messengers restored the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, and Joseph and Oliver were baptized. The time had come for the restoration of Christ&#39;s church on the earth. Approximately 60 people met in the Whitmer Cabin in Fayette, New York. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
President Hinckley wrote about that day, 
</p>
<p>
	I have tried to picture in imagination that April 6 of 1830, the day the Church was organized.... One wonders whether any of that group, other than Joseph Smith, who saw the prophetic vision, had any idea of the greatness of the thing they were beginning. From a rural area in Fayette, New York, from the simple Whitmer log farmhouse, there was to grow by constant accretion an organization worldwide in its scope and numbering millions in its membership.<a href="#24" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
As indicated by President Hinckley, Joseph did have a fuller vision of the future of the Church. He later prophesied, &quot;It is only a little handful of priesthood you see here . . . , but this Church will fill North and South America-it will fill the world.&quot;<a href="#25" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.<a href="#26" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
Early in 1831, responding to increasing persecution in New York and a number of new convert baptisms in Ohio, Joseph and the headquarters of the Church moved to Kirtland. Elder Ballard once commented that of all the Church history sites, the Kirtland area was his favorite because of the number of revelations the prophet received there. The Kirtland period was one of great joy for the prophet. The Church grew in numbers, a temple was built, the keys of the gathering of Israel, the dispensation of Abraham, and the sealing powers were restored, and the Lord came to accept his temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Joseph later wrote, 
</p>
<p>
	The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened. We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber. His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: . . . Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and rejoice. . . . For behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house.<a href="#27" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>27</sup> </a>

<strong>Who Can Forget Kirtland</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Who can forget Kirtland?<br />
	Each spot of ground where <br />
	Revelation came is <br />
	Hallowed by the memory of <br />
	Words spoken there, words direct <br />
	From God.<br />
	Then take off <br />
	Memories&#39; shoes, for here <br />
	Is sacred ground. <br />
	The ways of the Lord are <br />
	His own ways, and <br />
	None shall find them out <br />
	Until his holy will <br />
	Stands forth revealed.<a href="#28" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But the Kirtland period was also a time of sorrow for the prophet. Twins were born to Emma and Joseph there and both of them died. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>April 30, 1831</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Once more with solemn tread <br />
	Carry to the cemetery, <br />
	Not one new born child, <br />
	But two. Lay them in the <br />
	Quiet earth, <br />
	The new turned quiet earth.<br />
	And Emma lies grieving on the bed, <br />
	Finds no relief, no tiny head, <br />
	While Joseph holds a funeral for the <br />
	Dead.<br />
	And there on that same day, <br />
	Another grave. A mother fair, <br />
	That two might enter earth; John Murdock&#39;s wife, <br />
	Who died while giving birth-<br />
	The children live.<br />
	Then Joseph says to John: <br />
	Perhaps if Emma took <br />
	Your twins it would <br />
	Assuage her, <br />
	Bring her peace, <br />
	And ease the sorrow <br />
	In her heart.<br />
	And John replies: <br />
	They&#39;ll die without <br />
	A mother.<br />
	Let Emma have them.<br />
	I&#39;d rather that she would <br />
	Than someone else.<br />
	Emma Smith lies quiet on the bed, <br />
	And finds relief at last.<br />
	The mewling sounds bring <br />
	Comfort, and release, <br />
	And peace.<a href="#29" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Another sadness for Joseph during the Kirtland period was that some members of the Church apostatized and fell away. Some becoming Joseph&#39;s and the Church&#39;s bitterest enemies. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Mobbing</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Simonds Ryder, <br />
	Erstwhile member of the church, <br />
	Joined, having sought <br />
	And found a sign. But took <br />
	Quick offense because the <br />
	Prophet spelled his name with &quot;i&quot; instead of &quot;y&quot;, <br />
	Claiming that a holy ghost, <br />
	Which could not prompt <br />
	The spelling of his name <br />
	Correctly, was no holy ghost <br />
	Rejoined his former church.<br />
	Then picking up the cloak of <br />
	Ministry, now led a <br />
	Mob of men across the <br />
	Frozen earth toward <br />
	Johnson&#39;s house. The <br />
	Wild March sky was <br />
	Darkened by the gloomy night.<br />
	The men were <br />
	Fortified with liquor, <br />
	To bolster up their will <br />
	To hate and kill. 
	</p>
<p>
	They rushed the door, and eight <br />
	Spread eagled Joseph, and held him <br />
	High in air, <br />
	And carried him into the <br />
	Night.<br />
	He struggled to escape, and <br />
	Felled one strong one with a mighty <br />
	Kick before he was subdued.<br />
	Stop struggling or we&#39;ll kill you now, <br />
	They threatened him.<br />
	They laid him on the frozen earth <br />
	Holding him there by weight of numbers.<br />
	Simonds, ain&#39;t you going to kill <br />
	Him now? said one.<br />
	Simonds, where&#39;s the tar bucket?<br />
	Then tearing off his drawers and shirt, <br />
	One fell on him, <br />
	Scratching him from head to foot, <br />
	Until blood flowed...<br />
	They covered him with tar <br />
	Black, nasty, burning tar. 
	</p>
<p>
	There in the dark and cold<br />
	They left him lying <br />
	On the ground, <br />
	And ran away.<br />
	Painfully he staggered <br />
	To his feet, <br />
	And saw across the field <br />
	A beacon light; <br />
	And came once more <br />
	To Johnson&#39;s house.<br />
	Emma fainted <br />
	When she saw him <br />
	At the door.<br />
	All night they <br />
	Scraped the tar, <br />
	And washed his wounds.<br />
	Then dawned the Sabbath day, <br />
	And Joseph gaining strength, <br />
	Preached at the service <br />
	Held that day.<br />
	A group of mobbers came <br />
	To hear his word, and marveled <br />
	At the strength of this, the <br />
	Prophet of the Lord.<a href="#30" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>30 </sup></a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It was also during the Kirtland period that Joseph learned that the Saints gathering in Independence had been driven from their homes. Joseph left Kirtland to join them three times to share with them their sorrows and offer them his strength: once with Zion&#39;s camp in 1834; again in 1837, to help locate new places of gathering for the Saints he knew would come from every land; and again in 1838, when violence and persecution in Ohio finally drove Joseph, his family, and the Church to Far West, Missouri.<br />
</p>
<p>
Peace for Joseph and the Church proved elusive, however. By November 1838, Governor Boggs had issued the extermination order authorizing the Saints to be driven from the state of Missouri and Joseph had been betrayed, arrested, and hauled off to jail, first to Richmond and then to Liberty. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Rebuke (Nov. 1838)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The raw November night was cold.<br />
	The walls of the Richmond jail <br />
	Were colder still, <br />
	The brethren lay together <br />
	On the floor, in chains, <br />
	Linked together, leg to leg, <br />
	And wrist to wrist.<br />
	The cold iron burned into their flesh; <br />
	If one moved all must move, <br />
	That is, if moving more than <br />
	Just a foot or two.<br />
	Their guards, the lowest form of humankind, <br />
	Made short the hours by their blasphemies, <br />
	And bragged of evil deeds <br />
	Performed against the saints.<br />
	They vied with one another <br />
	As to who could tell the foulest tale-<br />
	These dastards bragging of their <br />
	Awful crimes.<br />
	Stand up, Joseph Smith!<br />
	Arise in vast, eternal <br />
	Dignity!<br />
	Rebuke those guards, <br />
	Those fiends in human form!<br />
	No devil could perform <br />
	Such evil deeds as they recounted, <br />
	Of aged men their murdered victims, <br />
	And young boys with <br />
	Dashed out brains.<br />
	And girls -- -- --!<br />
	Such innocence could turn <br />
	A heart of stone; <br />
	But not these men.<br />
	They desecrated the name of men, <br />
	And bragged <br />
	With rapine lust, of violence to women <br />
	And to girls, till death <br />
	Gave glad release. 
	</p>
<p>
	Then Joseph stood <br />
	In awful dignity <br />
	And in a voice of <br />
	Thunder he <br />
	Commanded them: <br />
	Silence! You fiends of hell!<br />
	Or you or I will die!<br />
	They cringed. They <br />
	Trembled at his feet <br />
	With awful fear!<br />
	Then, craven voiced, <br />
	They begged his pardon <br />
	For their awful deeds, <br />
	And quiet reigned <br />
	Once more.<a href="#31" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>31</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Liberty Jail, (a name that some have suggested represents great irony, for of all places there was no liberty in Liberty) Joseph mourned for the sufferings of his people and received succor from the Lord. 
</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>Out Of The Dungeon</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Out of the dungeon; <br />
	Out of the depths of misery, <br />
	Out of the depths of despair, <br />
	Out of the desperate heart: <br />
	Oh God, where art thou?<br />
	And where is the pavilion that <br />
	Covereth thy hiding place?<br />
	The anguished prayer <br />
	Ascends to God: <br />
	How long <br />
	Oh God, <br />
	Shall wrong, these wrongs, <br />
	Be suffered by thy saints?<br />
	Stretch forth thy hand <br />
	In mercy lest we faint: <br />
	My son, peace be to thy soul.<br />
	This adversity, these afflictions <br />
	Shall not last.<br />
	They pass as doth the <br />
	Hoarfrost on the hill <br />
	Before the warming sun.<br />
	Be still!<br />
	If thou endure them well, <br />
	No power in hell <br />
	Can stay thy hand.<br />
	Exhalted thou shalt be.<br />
	Thou hast thy friends, <br />
	They stand <br />
	Firm, <br />
	And warm, <br />
	And pure.<br />
	My servant, Job, <br />
	Has suffered more than thou.<br />
	He lost his friends <br />
	And all he had.<br />
	What more could he endure? 
	</p>
<p>
	Wo unto those who <br />
	Fight against the Lord; <br />
	Cursed are those who <br />
	Lift the heel against <br />
	The bearer of my Word.<br />
	They shall be swept away, <br />
	A mighty flood of truth <br />
	Shall bear them down <br />
	And cast them from the presence <br />
	Of the Lord. 
	</p>
<p>
	But God will love <br />
	And build on the man <br />
	Who with the priesthood <br />
	In his heart and soul,<br />
	Exercises persuasive love, <br />
	Long suffering to those who err, <br />
	Who, led by gentleness, <br />
	By meekness, too, of heart, <br />
	By unfeigned love, persuades <br />
	The sons of God <br />
	To act their part.<br />
	This is the promise of the <br />
	Lord:<br />
	Take comfort, Joseph Smith.<br />
	Your enemies may rage, <br />
	And devils laugh with <br />
	Fiendish glee at you <br />
	In your hour of misery.<br />
	Your friends are near.<br />
	Don&#39;t fear! 
	</p>
<p>
	The ends of the earth <br />
	Shall inquire after thy <br />
	Name,<br />
	And fools shall have thee <br />
	In derision, <br />
	And hell shall rage <br />
	Against thee;<br />
	While the pure in heart, <br />
	And the wise, <br />
	And the noble, <br />
	And the virtuous, <br />
	Shall seek counsel, <br />
	And authority, <br />
	And blessings constantly <br />
	From under thy hand. <br />
	And thy people shall never <br />
	Be turned against thee <br />
	By the testimony of traitors, <br />
	And although their influence <br />
	Shall cast thee into trouble, <br />
	And into bars and walls, <br />
	Thou shalt be had in honor;<br />
	And but for a small moment <br />
	And thy voice shall be more terrible <br />
	In the midst of thine enemies <br />
	Than the fierce lion, <br />
	Because of thy righteousness;<br />
	And thy God <br />
	Shall stand with thee <br />
	Forever and ever... 
	</p>
<p>
	And then God said:<br />
	The Son of Man has <br />
	Descended below them <br />
	All. <br />
	Art thou greater than <br />
	He?<a href="#32" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a>

After six months in Missouri jails, Joseph and his companions escaped to rejoin the main body of Saints hunkered down in a mosquito-infested swamp called Commerce, Illinois. He healed the sick, directed the draining of the swamp, and built Nauvoo-The City Beautiful. Here the Saints seemed destined for success. They sent out missionaries, established a university, organized the Relief Society, and began construction on the Nauvoo Temple and Joseph publically announced the doctrine of baptism for the dead and administered the first endowment ordinances. But as in other areas, persecution developed. By 1844, Joseph&#39;s enemies, again former members of the Church, seemed bent on his destruction. He began planning with the brethren to move the Church west to the Rocky Mountains. Governor Ford, meanwhile, made plans to have Joseph taken east to Carthage.

<p>
<strong>We&#39;ll Cross the River and Go West (June 22nd, 1844)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	That Saturday in June <br />
	Was one of heaviness.<br />
	Tragedy was in the air.<br />
	No one could put <br />
	His finger on it, <br />
	Or say just where <br />
	Or whence it came, <br />
	But it was there, <br />
	Uneasy, undefined.<br />
	The kind that builds up <br />
	Fear, <br />
	An undefined fear. 
	</p>
<p>
	The brethren sat <br />
	And counseled one another <br />
	On their course.<br />
	Things were getting worse.<br />
	Then word came: <br />
	Come to Carthage unarmed, <br />
	Without escort, or else-<br />
	The threat could leave no doubt-<br />
	We&#39;ll march on Nauvoo.<br />
	But on the other hand,...<br />
	If you do come, <br />
	I pledge to you <br />
	Protection from the <br />
	Mobs and hostile men.<br />
	The signature was <br />
	Thomas Ford&#39;s, <br />
	Governor of Illinois. 
	</p>
<p>
	The letter read <br />
	And pondered, <br />
	Joseph said: <br />
	There is no mercy, <br />
	No mercy here.<br />
	Then Hyrum spoke: <br />
	I fear that if we <br />
	Fall into their hands <br />
	We are dead men.<br />
	Their gloomy minds could see <br />
	No ray of light.... 
	</p>
<p>
	Then Joseph brightened up: <br />
	There is a way. It is <br />
	Quite clear to me; <br />
	They&#39;ll come and search, <br />
	No doubt, <br />
	But we&#39;ll be gone.<br />
	We&#39;ll cross the river <br />
	And go west <br />
	And find a place <br />
	To bring the saints, <br />
	And start again a <br />
	City to the Lord.<br />
	We&#39;ll start as soon <br />
	As it is dark.<br />
	Assemble horses on the <br />
	Montrose side, <br />
	And such supplies <br />
	As we shall need!<br />
	And so it was agreed.<a href="#33" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>33 </sup></a>

<strong>The Quick Good-bye</strong>
</p>
<p>
	What did a prophet say <br />
	In quick good-bye <br />
	To cherished wife <br />
	And children small?<br />
	No words convey <br />
	The anguish of the soul.<br />
	She could not believe <br />
	His danger was so great.<br />
	Don&#39;t go! Don&#39;t leave <br />
	Me now she cried....<br />
	There was no word that could be said....<br />
	And so with sobbing cry, <br />
	His heart&#39;s love poured in tears <br />
	He went out into the night.<a href="#34" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>34</sup></a>

Late on the evening of the 22nd, Orrin Porter Rockwell rowed Joseph, Hyrum and Willard Richards west across the Mississippi River. But the Lord required one more sacrifice of Joseph. On the 23rd a message from Nauvoo told Joseph that several feared that if the Church&#39;s enemies came to Nauvoo and found Joseph gone that the mob would attack the city. Joseph made the fateful decision. If his life was of no value to his friends, it was of no value to him. The small party returned to Nauvoo the next day and made preparation to go the Carthage.

<p>
	Hyrum sat in his house <br />
	Waiting for the Prophet Joseph Smith <br />
	To start to Carthage, <br />
	Having said good-bye to Mary Fielding Smith <br />
	And to the children, <br />
	Comforting them that he would <br />
	Soon return. The governor was just, <br />
	The law would be obeyed.<br />
	As he sat he read from <br />
	That loved book so interwoven <br />
	With his life, <br />
	The book that Mormon wrote: <br />
	And it came to pass <br />
	That I prayed unto the Lord <br />
	That he would give unto the <br />
	Gentiles grace, that they <br />
	Might have charity.<br />
	And it came to pass that <br />
	The Lord said unto me: <br />
	If they have not charity <br />
	It mattereth not unto thee, <br />
	thou hast been faithful; <br />
	Wherefore, thy garments <br />
	Shall be made clean.<br />
	And because thou hast seen <br />
	Thy weakness thou shalt <br />
	Be made strong, <br />
	Even unto the sitting down <br />
	In the place which I have <br />
	Prepared <br />
	In the mansions <br />
	Of my Father. 
	</p>
<p>
	The time had come.<br />
	He turned the page down <br />
	On what he&#39;d read <br />
	And closed the book.<br />
	He held his loved Mary <br />
	In one last embrace, <br />
	Then rode with Joseph <br />
	Over the hill and out of <br />
	Sight<a href="#35" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>35</sup></a><sup> </sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Joseph knew what Hyrum only suspected, that they were riding to Carthage to seal their final testimony. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Like A Lamb</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Prophet reined his horse: <br />
	Just one last look<br />
	On fair Nauvoo.<br />
	This temple here-<br />
	There is so much to do....<br />
	And now the horses <br />
	Walked <br />
	Across the prairie sod <br />
	Where the tall grass <br />
	Waved a last farewell.<br />
	The growing corn was tall <br />
	And bowed collective <br />
	Tasseled head.<br />
	A soft breeze, <br />
	Warm, bestirred <br />
	His brow.<br />
	And now he stopped <br />
	And gazed again <br />
	And said the fateful <br />
	Words: <br />
	I go, said he, as <br />
	Lambs go to the <br />
	Slaughter pen, <br />
	Yet I am calm, <br />
	Calm as the <br />
	Morn <br />
	Upon the <br />
	Summer hills.<br />
	My conscience has the <br />
	Peace of morning peace, <br />
	Devoid of offense toward <br />
	My God, <br />
	And toward all men.<br />
	I die innocent.<br />
	My blood shall cry <br />
	From the ground.<a href="#36" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>36</sup></a>

<p>
By the afternoon of June 27, 1844, only John Taylor and Willard Richards remained in the Carthage Jail with the Prophet and his brother Hyrum. 
</p>
<p>
	That afternoon following dinner, the jailer, knowing of the mob outside, suggested that they would be safer in the cell of the jail. Turning to Willard Richards, Joseph asked, &lsquo;If we go into the cell will you go with us?&#39; 
	</p>
<p>
<br />
	To this Elder Richards responded, &lsquo;Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with you ... you did not ask me to come to Carthage ... you did not ask me to come to jail with you-and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for &quot;treason,&quot; I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.&#39;<a href="#37" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>37 </sup></a>

<strong>A Poor Wayfaring Man . . . (June 27th, 1844)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The night was past, <br />
	The hot night, <br />
	The sultry, hot <br />
	June night.<br />
	The rain was falling <br />
	As the day began.<br />
	The clouds were grey <br />
	And hung low in the <br />
	Lowering air.<br />
	There was a passing back and forth <br />
	Of messengers, <br />
	Confirming threats of <br />
	Murder; confirming, too, <br />
	That Thomas Ford would <br />
	Ride into Nauvoo <br />
	To make a speech.<br />
	He was warned that if he went, <br />
	And left the prisoners <br />
	With the Carthage Greys to guard, <br />
	They would not live out the day. 
	</p>
<p>
	And so he went and left <br />
	Them to their fate. 
	</p>
<p>
	The upstairs room was hot and humid <br />
	As the day grew long.<br />
	Then lunch was brought, <br />
	And afterward to cheer their spirits up <br />
	The Prophet said: John, <br />
	Sing us a song.<br />
	A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief, <br />
	Is what we&#39;d like.<br />
	It will fit the mood I&#39;m in.<br />
	John Taylor sang the plaintive words.<br />
	The sweet tones filled the <br />
	Room and went beyond <br />
	And down the stair, <br />
	The jailor heard, <br />
	And those outside the jail... 
	</p>
<p>
	The love of Christ was in the song, <br />
	The love of man, <br />
	There in that room in Carthage Jail <br />
	On that hot afternoon.<a href="#38" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>38 </sup></a>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
<strong>The Martyrdom [first two stanzas]</strong>
</p>
<p>
	There is a shout, a yell <br />
	As though the fiends of hell <br />
	Have broken loose.<br />
	A hundred men appear, <br />
	Their faces blackened as the <br />
	Night.<br />
	They rush the stair, <br />
	they curse; they force <br />
	The door. <br />
	They fire- 
	</p>
<p>
	Hyrum is dead upon the <br />
	Floor; <br />
	John Taylor wounded sore; <br />
	And Joseph Smith <br />
	The Prophet is no more.<br />
	His wounds have killed him <br />
	As he fell.<br />
	He is lying at the curb <br />
	Beside the well.<a href="#39" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>39</sup></a><sup> </sup>
</p>
<p>
<br />
John Taylor was one of the first to bear testimony of the prophet Joseph after the martyrdom. He wrote, 
</p>
<p>
	Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man who ever lived in it. . . . He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord&#39;s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!<a href="#40" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>40</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
All subsequent prophets have also born testimony of Joseph and his mission. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
President Benson wrote, 
</p>
<p>
	I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, one of the greatest prophets that has ever lived on the earth. He was the instrument in God&#39;s hand in ushering in the present gospel dispensation, the greatest of all, and the last of all in preparation for the second coming of the Master.<a href="#41" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>41</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And President Hinckley affirmed, &quot;I give you my testimony of him. He was the ordained servant of God, this Joseph, raised up to become the mighty prophet of this dispensation-&quot;a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ.&quot;<a href="#42" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>42</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
&nbsp;I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. I love the doctrines that he taught. I love the revelations he received. I love the Church he restored. I appreciate the challenges and sacrifices he faced in fulfilling his calling because I understand that I, that we, are the beneficiaries of those challenges and sacrifices. In fact as I look back on his life today, I understand that it is those challenges and sacrifices that deepen my love for the Prophet even more. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was called by the Lord to be His Prophet in this dispensation to restore the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth, that he was &quot;chastened and tried, even as Abraham&quot; so that he could be &quot;sanctified.&quot;<a href="#43" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>43</sup></a> That he grew &quot;from grace to grace&quot;<a href="#44" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>44</sup></a> through the experiences he had and the knowledge he acquired. Just like the Prophet we too have been called of the Lord. If we accept our challenges and trials in the spirit of faith, and apply to them the power of the Atonement, the Holy Ghost will cause a &quot;mighty change . . . in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.&quot;<a href="#45" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>45</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Prophet Joseph, despite his willingness and faithfulness was not prepared in the spring of 1820 to be the disciple the Lord knew he could be-that He needed him to be. That would require a lifetime of experiences, teaching and training. The same is true for all of us. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

I am grateful to be with you at such an important time of your life.&nbsp; Congratulations to you for your choice of attending Brigham Young University-Idaho and for your commitment to the values of this institution.&nbsp; I also offer my congratulations to your parents for their sacrifice in making your education possible.&nbsp; I hope you will always be respectful and appreciative for the roles your parents played to bring you to this moment.&nbsp; You are here because of choices you have made and commitments you have met.&nbsp; You decided to live your life in such a manner that would qualify you to matriculate at this wonderful university.&nbsp; You made choices in your early life regarding moral standards, spiritual commitments, and academic excellence.&nbsp; And these choices continue to provide the foundation principles that can successfully guide you throughout the rest of your lives. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As you leave this outstanding university you will be able to put on your resume &quot;graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho.&quot;&nbsp; This will undoubtedly be the most important item on your resume up to this date.&nbsp; However, it is just the beginning of your life-long resume&mdash;the resume the Lord calls &quot;the Book of Life&quot;&mdash;the resume the scriptures tell us we will be judged by.&nbsp; As in the past, the content of your final resume will be the result of choices.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Every hour of every day you are making choices.&nbsp; You choose the thoughts you think, the passions you feel, and the actions you allow yourselves to perform.&nbsp; Some of these choices will be the most important choices of your lives.&nbsp; In fact many of them will be life defining. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important choice you have made is the value system that has governed all your past choices.&nbsp; And the most important choice you will make in the future is what value system will govern all your future choices. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As long as your value system is anchored in the doctrines of the gospel, you will continue to make choices that will guide you through this life and reward you with both temporal and eternal blessings.&nbsp; Those of you who have a belief in Christ and His atoning sacrifice will choose differently than those who do not adhere to such principles and doctrines.&nbsp; Such value systems will be the basis for personal revelation and will guide you as to what is included on your final resume, the &quot;book of life.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now you are about to leave the security and safety of these hallowed halls to finish writing your resume.&nbsp; Some of you will move on to graduate school.&nbsp; Some will be doctors, politicians, educators, scientists, businessmen, businesswomen, and some will move into that most important role of mothers, nurturers and guardians of the future.&nbsp; Whatever your pursuit, as you write your final resume, protect and nurture your governing value system.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
You have already proven yourselves to be bright, inquisitive, focused, and ambitious.&nbsp; You have earned your diploma and that distinction will always be yours.&nbsp; But rest assured-life begins with graduation.&nbsp; Your diploma speaks of the past, but your future choices and actions will speak for the future. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I suggest three choices, all of which will sustain and protect your governing value system, will have eternal consequences, and all of which can find themselves on the final resume you present to the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First I would say, choose faith.&nbsp; Yes, faith is not a gift given without thought, desire, or effort.&nbsp; It is earned.&nbsp; It is a reward.&nbsp; It is a choice.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We live in a time of conflicting messages.&nbsp; From our modern prophets we are taught to remain pure, steadfast, and honorable.&nbsp; However, conduct previously considered wrong or even outrageous is now becoming both acceptable and mainstream.&nbsp; Isaiah warned of these difficult times as reported in both the Old Testament and the Book of Mormon:&nbsp; &quot;Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!&quot; (2 Nephi 15:20; see also Isaiah 5:20).&nbsp; And yet that is exactly what has happened.&nbsp; Pornography, casual sex, living together before marriage, so-called recreational drugs, and many other immoral and degenerate practices are becoming acceptable in the world we live in.&nbsp; The continual bombardment of such messages often causes confusion, doubt, and pessimism, each attacking the fundamental truths we believe in-attacking our faith in God, our hope in the future, and our optimism for both now and the future.&nbsp; This is our world. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so today, within this challenging environment, we do stand each moment of each hour of each day making choices that define the tomorrows of our lives.&nbsp; The choice is yours and that choice is faith.&nbsp; As you are faced with conflicting messages, sometimes attacking your well-established value system, I say choose faith.&nbsp; Choose faith over doubt, choose faith over fear, choose faith over the unknown and the unseen, and choose faith over pessimism.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Lord in the 88<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants admonished, even commanded, that we continue to study and learn.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom&quot; (v. 118).&nbsp; That includes literature, history, mathematics, business, all matters of sciences, and so on.&nbsp; However, sometimes learning without faith can result in misunderstandings or even a sense of intellectual arrogance or egotism. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There are indeed those who have let their intellect undermine their spiritual moorings.&nbsp; There are those who would substitute their own knowledge for the knowledge of God.&nbsp; We see that even today by those who constantly attack and ridicule sacred truths and covenants.&nbsp; Alma had Korihor to deal with.&nbsp; The Savior had the learned lawyers, the scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sanhedrin to deal with.&nbsp; Today we have their modern parallels with agnosticism, atheism, pessimism, secularism, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Jacob warns with these words: &nbsp;&quot;O that cunning plan of the evil one! &nbsp;O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! &nbsp;When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. &nbsp;And they shall perish&quot; (2 Nephi 9:28).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Yes, the Lord admonished us to continue learning, to be the best we can in whatever field we pursue.&nbsp; But He gave us a safeguard to our learning.&nbsp; Finishing the Lord&#39;s admonition in the 88<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants to &quot;seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom,&quot; the Lord clarifies that we should &quot;seek learning, even by study and also by faith&quot; (D&amp;C 88:118).&nbsp; Studying the best books but then also learning by applying God&#39;s inspiration, with prayer and scripture study, validates our learning, provides tempering, and sustains our faith.&nbsp; Do not be deceived because you cannot prove the doctrines or the revelations in centimeters or in a test tube.&nbsp; The Lord does not use the metric scale or a chemistry lab to measure faith.&nbsp; With all your learning and intellectual enlightenment, do not lose your grip of the iron rod.&nbsp; The Lord gave us the sure sign of truth and knowledge through personal revelation as revealed by the teacher and testifier of eternal truth, the Holy Ghost. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Alma&#39;s classic discussion on faith in the 32nd chapter of Alma gives five choices to ensure the development and preservation of our faith:&nbsp; &quot;But behold, if ye will <u>awake and arouse your faculties</u>, even to an <u>experiment upon my words</u>, and <u>exercise a particle of faith</u>, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words. Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if <u>ye do not cast it out by your unbelief</u>, . . . it will begin to swell within your breasts&quot; (Alma 32:27-28). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us <u>nourish it with great care</u>. . .&nbsp; But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and . . . it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out&quot; (Alma 32:37-38). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you can apply Alma&#39;s teaching of faith to the everyday challenges you are likely to confront. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so the choice is yours.&nbsp; When your testimony or well-established value system is under attack, which it probably will be sometime in your life, choose faith.&nbsp; You are responsible for your own faith.&nbsp; You are also responsible for a lack of faith. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Second choice: &nbsp;choose humility and its companion gratitude.&nbsp; In the recent months and years we have personally witnessed the tragedies of pride, self-service, and self-aggrandizement.&nbsp; It is clear that the lack of humility and gratitude often leads to egotism, arrogance, or greed.&nbsp; Today we have plenty of role models of the so-called successful who have lost their spiritual moorings of good and right because of lack of humility and gratitude.&nbsp; One only has to look at those who for their own self-interest and gratification have promoted themselves at the expense of their friends, family, and community.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As you enter into the next phase of your lives you will have varying degrees of success.&nbsp; Some of you are going to be doctors, will excel in education or politics, or will hold other prominent positions.&nbsp; What a heavy burden prominence places on the successful for success is not always easy to carry.&nbsp; In all your success, don&#39;t forget your roots.&nbsp; Most of you or your parents or your grandparents came from very humble beginnings.&nbsp; They have laid the foundation of your success through their personal and sustained sacrifices.&nbsp; They have instilled in you the virtues that will carry you through your future.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As you enter the workforce or this new phase of life, you will likely discover that humility is often misunderstood.&nbsp; Not many corporations or institutions include humility as a value statement or desired characteristic of management.&nbsp; Some may even see it as a weakness.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; Humility is the fountain from which the waters of gratitude flow.&nbsp; My experience has been that truly great achievers have never forgotten their roots; they have never forgotten the sacrifices made in their behalf and they cease not to be grateful.&nbsp; That humility and gratitude manifests itself in how you accept success and how you treat the less successful.&nbsp; I repeat: &nbsp;that humility and gratitude manifests itself in how you accept success and how you treat the less successful.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Fourteenth-Century philosopher/poet Shams-ud-din Muhammad Hafiz said it best:&nbsp; &quot;Greatness is always built on this foundation: the ability to appear, speak and act, as the most common man.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Be grateful for the heritage that has brought you to this point in your life.&nbsp; Accept your gifts with humility and gratitude.&nbsp; Further, it matters not who you are or how lofty your credentials appear, humility and gratitude are the ingredients to happiness and success. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Book of Mormon gives this inspired counsel, &quot;And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; . . . always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive&quot; (Alma 7:23).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A story is told of an encounter between the Prophet Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.&nbsp; In the presence of a rather large group of brethren, the Prophet severely chastised Brother Brigham for some failing in his duty.&nbsp; Everyone, I suppose somewhat stunned, waited to see what Brigham&#39;s response would be.&nbsp; After all, Brigham, who later became known as the Lion of the Lord, was no shrinking violet by any means.&nbsp; Brigham slowly rose to his feet, and in words that truly reflected his character and his humility, he simply bowed his head and said, &quot;Joseph, what do you want me to do?&quot;&nbsp; The story goes that, sobbing, Joseph ran from the podium, threw his arms around Brigham, and said in effect, &quot;You passed, Brother Brigham, you passed&quot; (see Truman G. Madsen, &quot;Hugh B. Brown-Youthful Veteran,&quot; <em>New Era</em>, Apr. 1976, 16).&nbsp; Brigham, one of the greatest leaders of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the &quot;Lion of the Lord,&quot; displayed his greatness through his humility. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
King Benjamin warned that we must become &quot;as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us]&quot; (Mosiah 3:19).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Whatever our station in life, whatever our achievements-no matter how great-a humble and grateful heart is still fundamental to our faith.&nbsp; Don&#39;t let your worldly successes or earthly learning become a substitute for spiritual wisdom, divine direction, and a humble and grateful heart.&nbsp; Count your blessings and give thanks. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Savior is our supreme example of the power of humility.&nbsp; After all, His humbly submitting His will to the Father brought about the greatest, and even the most powerful, event in all of history.&nbsp; Choose humility and gratitude. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As an introduction to a third choice, I now relate a personal experience about others who set a path for me to follow. I attended graduate school at Indiana University.&nbsp; My first day in an economics class was with a well-known professor who had the reputation of being tough, demanding, and for a number of other reasons was somewhat feared.&nbsp; As this was the first day in his class, he asked each of us to stand and introduce ourselves, giving our name and the university we graduated from.&nbsp; When it was my turn I gave my name and said I had just graduated from Brigham Young University.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The professor stopped the introductions and said something like this, &quot;It is wonderful to have another great student from Brigham Young University in this class.&quot;&nbsp; Now he did not say this about the very capable students from Indiana, Minnesota, Harvard, or other respected universities.&nbsp; He then asked, &quot;Do you know &lsquo;so and so&#39; from BYU?&quot;&nbsp; I knew him.&nbsp; He went on, &quot;Do you know &lsquo;so and so&#39; from BYU?&quot;&nbsp; I knew him.&nbsp; Then he named others, some of whom I knew and others I did not.&nbsp; Then he said they had all been outstanding students and great examples.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I savored the undeserved limelight for those few moments, I was grateful for a string of LDS students who had preceded me at Indiana University.&nbsp; I was grateful for the impressions and influence these students had made on the life of this professor, and probably others.&nbsp; I was determined not to mar the reputation of myself or those who had left such a legacy of example.&nbsp; This legacy was a motivation to me throughout my schooling at Indiana and my professional life.&nbsp; These accolades came because of a value system reflected in the lives of the students, a value system based upon the principles and doctrines of the gospel, a value system included and taught in the curriculum of BYU.&nbsp; At Indiana I was grateful for the footprints that had been left and the candles that had been lit.&nbsp; You also can leave footprints and light candles. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Savior has said, &quot;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works&quot; (Matthew 5:16).&nbsp; The Apostle Paul charged Timothy with these words: &nbsp;&quot;Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity&quot; (1 Timothy 4:12). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As graduates of Brigham Young University-Idaho, you are already identified as one who has high standards.&nbsp; You are a marked person.&nbsp; You are known to not only have unusual standards, you are expected to live them.&nbsp; What a privilege to be so known and to so live!&nbsp; You will find great joy being a light and an example to others.&nbsp; So, third and final, choose to be a light and an example. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so as you complete your final resume as a graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho, be prepared to include: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If you are able to put these three things on the resume you present to the Lord, you will be faithful to your value system and have a wonderful, productive life.&nbsp; You will have challenges and trials, yes, but you will be equipped to deal with the adversities of mortality, living life with confidence and gratitude.&nbsp; As a new graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho, start now to prepare your final resume. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My prayer and blessing for you is that each of you will prosper in all your righteous endeavors and that you will find success and happiness in all that you do as you pursue your dreams beyond this wonderful institution.&nbsp; This I pray for in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

It is a joy to be with you today on another great day at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I hope that your time here will be a time of learning and insight, a time of reflection and resolve to act on what you learn.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today to teach us what the Lord wants us to do and to be. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Sister Clark and I arrived in Rexburg almost four years ago.&nbsp; Since that time we have focused most of our time and energies on educating the rising generation-in our own family, in our ward, and, of course, at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; It is a glorious work.&nbsp; In that time we also have been involved in the remarkable changes taking place all across this valley-a new temple, the creation of many new wards and stakes, and the gathering together of many Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; We have witnessed the Saints of the latter-days building Zion in this place. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the time we have together today, I would like to connect these two latter-day miracles-the rising generation and the establishment of Zion.&nbsp; You and I have an errand from the Lord to help the rising generation develop the Spirit of Zion so that all through their lives wherever they are they will build Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Prophet Joseph taught: 
</p>
<p>
	&quot;The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; . . . but . . . we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory; . . .&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p>
	We ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object . . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The revelations of the Restoration give us wonderful and sure promises about the establishment of Zion.&nbsp; The Lord has promised that He will &quot;raise up unto [Himself] a pure people,&quot;<sup><a href="#2" target="_self" target="_self">2</a></sup> that the pure in heart [will] build up Zion.<a href="#4" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; In all these promises, the Lord does not speak in contingent language.&nbsp; He declares what will be.&nbsp; And so we know that Zion will be established, indeed, is being established, in our midst in these valleys and all across the earth. Zion will grow and strengthen if you and I and the rising generation keep the two great commandments the Lord has given us about the building up of Zion.&nbsp; Listen carefully to the Lord&#39;s words in the 133<sup>rd</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yea, verily I say unto you again, the time has come when the voice of the Lord is unto you:&nbsp; Go ye out of Babylon; . . .&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and the voice of the Lord unto all people:&nbsp; Go ye forth unto the land of Zion, that the borders of my people may be enlarged, and that her stakes may be strengthened, and that Zion may go forth unto the regions round about.<sup><a href="#4" target="_self" target="_self">4</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Elder D. Todd Chistofferson said this about Babylon: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;The antithesis and antagonist of Zion is Babylon. &nbsp;Its worldliness, its worship of evil, . . . all combine to make Babylon the symbol of decadent societies and spiritual bondage.&quot;<sup><a href="#5" target="_self" target="_self">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so, these are the two great commandments:&nbsp; 1) go out from spiritual Babylon; and 2) go forth to Zion, that Zion may go forth.&nbsp; These commandments are in force in our day.&nbsp; We are to flee Babylon and gather to the covenant people of the Lord in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; We are to leave the towers and the great and spacious buildings of Babylon, and we are to come to Zion and stand in holy places.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As we reflect on how we can help the rising generation to flee Babylon and come to Zion, it may be helpful to think of spiritual Babylon as a great city.&nbsp; In its core, where the neon lights shine bright, there is much wickedness-violence, gross immorality, robbery, adultery, terrible abuse, and all the values and attitudes that support wickedness on a grand scale.&nbsp; It is the center of debauchery and evil.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Outside the core of the city lie the suburbs of Babylon; here there is also sinfulness and wickedness, but they are more subtle.&nbsp; Here we find pornography, drugs, alcohol, love of money and power, covetousness, corruption, anger, and revenge.&nbsp; As we move further, we come to the rolling hills of Babylon.&nbsp; Here, too, there is sin; but it is in the form of selfishness, gossip, impatience, laziness, contention, entitlement, and pride. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The command to go out from Babylon is a command to leave not only the core of the city, but the suburbs and the rolling hills. 
</p>
<p>
Elder Christofferson said this about fleeing Babylon and coming to Zion: 
</p>
<p>
	&quot;To come to Zion, it is not enough for you or me to be somewhat less wicked than others.&nbsp; We are to become not only good but holy men and women.&nbsp; Recalling Elder Neal A. Maxwell&#39;s phrase, let us once and for all establish our residence in Zion and give up the summer cottage in Babylon.&quot;<a href="#6" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
You and I and the rising generation face at least two great challenges in fleeing Babylon and establishing Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If Babylon were a place, we could just leave; but it is not a place.&nbsp; It is all around us.&nbsp; It is a pattern of worldly doctrines, attitudes, and actions that permeate our culture and our society.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder David R. Stone described the pervasive nature of Babylon this way: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;With the encroachment of Babylon, we have to create Zion in the midst of it.&nbsp; We should not allow ourselves to be engulfed by the culture which surrounds us.&nbsp; We seldom realize the extent to which we are a product of the culture of our place and time.&quot;<sup><a href="#7" target="_self" target="_self">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Babylon is the world and everything of the world.&nbsp; For some of the rising generation, and even for some of us, being in Babylon is like being a fish in water.&nbsp; The water is so pervasive and so common the fish does not even recognize that there is such a thing as water.&nbsp; So it may be for some of us with the patterns and culture of Babylon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If the young people of the rising generation are to flee Babylon, they must recognize and reject its patterns-the doctrines, attitudes, and practices that are pervasive in our society.&nbsp; The gospel of Jesus Christ must penetrate deep into their hearts.&nbsp; Through repentance, obedience, and the sanctifying influence of the Holy Ghost, their values and attitudes and very nature must be transformed by the power of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They must become new creatures in Christ-the covenant, consecrated people of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That will only happen if they get all the way out-out from the center, from the suburbs, and from the rolling hills of Babylon.&nbsp; This means they must recognize what Babylon is and flee it, which brings us to the second challenge. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Babylon is not just an alternative way of life; Babylon actively fights against Zion.&nbsp; Some of the attacks on Zion are clear, even blatant efforts to lure the rising generation into the evil center of Babylon or into the suburbs of pornography and drug abuse.&nbsp; But many of the attacks are subtle, even disguised temptations that carefully persuade the rising generation to adopt the doctrines, attitudes, and behavior of the rolling hills of Babylon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Behavior and attitudes that violate God&#39;s commandments are presented in the doctrines of popular culture with words and images that camouflage their true nature.&nbsp; Attitudes that could lead to wickedness-for example, selfishness and immodesty-are held up as enlightened and advanced, acclaimed in society and popular media.&nbsp; Practices that weaken the family are cloaked in the language of career success, personal pride, and self-realization.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Stone described this deception and its effects on us this way: 
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Our culture tends to determine what foods we like, how we dress . . . and our attitudes toward honesty.&nbsp; It also influences men as to the importance of recreation or religion, influences women about the priority of career or childbearing, and has a powerful effect on how we approach procreation and moral issues.&nbsp; All too often, we are like puppets on a string, as our culture determines what is &#39;cool.&#39;&quot;<sup><a href="#8" target="_self" target="_self">8</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These are the great challenges of Babylon-it is all around us, and its most insidious elements that fight against Zion are hidden and disguised.&nbsp; If we are to help the rising generation develop the spirit of Zion and build Zion, we must help them see Babylon and we must help them see Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But this is the great blessing of Zion.&nbsp; Zion is not hidden or disguised.&nbsp; Zion is bright and shining.&nbsp; It is the ensign to the nations.&nbsp; And once you see Zion, you can see Babylon much more clearly.&nbsp; It is like seeing the difference between the sun and neon lights.&nbsp; Once you have seen the sun and felt its warmth and life and power, you can see neon lights for what they really are-flash and buzz; but artificial, lifeless, and empty. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The rising generation can see Zion and the building of Zion in the temples of the Lord, in living prophets, in the rolling forth of the kingdom of God in the earth.&nbsp; But their most powerful and important perspective is what they see of Zion in our lives.&nbsp; At the temple at Bountiful, the Savior said this: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world.&nbsp; Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up-that which ye have seen me do. 
	</p>
<p>
	I have commanded that . . . ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world.&quot;<sup><a href="#9" target="_self" target="_self">9 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The rising generation will see the Savior and feel His love and mercy and grace; and they will see and feel Zion in us, in what we teach, in what we do, and in who we are. 
</p>
<p>
In the words of Elder Christofferson: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Zion is Zion because of the character, attributes, and faithfulness of her citizens.&nbsp; Remember, t&#39;he Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them&#39; (Moses 7:18). We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen-Zion will come only as they happen.&quot;<sup><a href="#10" target="_self" target="_self">10 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I want to use these three characteristics to frame our discussion of what you and I must do to help the rising generation develop the patterns of Zion in their lives. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Unity: &nbsp;</strong>The people of Zion are of one heart and one mind-unified in Christ.&nbsp; They are one, and they are His.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Pure in heart:&nbsp; </strong>Zion is the pure in heart.&nbsp; The people of Zion dwell in righteousness; the laws of the celestial kingdom prevail in Zion.&nbsp; The people of Zion are a holy people. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; No poor among them</strong>: &nbsp;There are no poor among the people of Zion, neither in food and clothing, nor in spiritual strength and support.&nbsp; Among the people of Zion, &quot;every man [seeks] the interest of his neighbor.&quot;<sup><a href="#11" target="_self" target="_self">11</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
At the heart of each of these overarching characteristics are patterns of values, attitudes, and actions that help us build Zion.&nbsp; We can&#39;t build Zion by passively waiting for someone else to do something to us or for us.&nbsp; We build Zion by acting in faith under the direction of the Holy Ghost to understand, internalize, and apply the doctrines of salvation and to recognize and flee from the corresponding attitudes and practices of Babylon that fight against Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let me illustrate what I mean with a few examples connected to each of the three characteristics of Zion.&nbsp; Let&#39;s begin with &quot;Unity.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #1:&nbsp; Forgiveness</em>
</p>
<p>
We are commanded to forgive all men.&nbsp; Forgiveness is essential to establishing Zion.&nbsp; We all sin; we all make mistakes.&nbsp; If we do not forgive one another, we deny the power of the Atonement.&nbsp; Those hurts fester and become resentments and anger.&nbsp; They destroy unity and dissolve the bonds of charity that are essential to Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon, people always feel like victims.&nbsp; They seek blame, punishment and vindication for even the slightest inconvenience.&nbsp; There is no forgiveness in Babylon.&nbsp; In their pride the people of Babylon are easily offended, hold grudges, and give voice to anger and resentment. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #2:&nbsp; Humility; Cooperation</em>
</p>
<p>
An attitude of humility is central to a life centered in Christ.&nbsp; The people of Zion are of one heart and mind because they are humbly united in Christ.&nbsp; Each seeks the interest of his neighbor, so there is in Zion an attitude and practice of humble cooperation. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Pride rules in Babylon.&nbsp; The basic attitude is: &nbsp;What is in it for me?&nbsp; Babylon thrives on competition, envy, and comparisons with others.&nbsp; Selfishness and materialism breed self-promotion and contention.&nbsp; In modern Babylon we hear the echo of Korihor:&nbsp; &quot;every man prosper[s] according to his genius, . . . every man conquer[s] according to his strength.&quot;<sup><a href="#12" target="_self" target="_self">12 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s now turn to three patterns that help us to be pure in heart. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #3:&nbsp; Obedience to God</em>
</p>
<p>
Obedience to God is the foundation of Zion.&nbsp; It is the pathway to purity of heart and becoming a holy people.&nbsp; An attitude of obedience is essential to building Zion.&nbsp; In its highest form, obedience comes from feeling Christ&#39;s love, in turn, loving Him, acting in faith in Him, and submitting our will to His. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon the countervailing pattern is rebellion:&nbsp; &quot;They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.&quot;<sup><a href="#13" target="_self" target="_self">13 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #4:&nbsp; Modesty</em>
</p>
<p>
The people of Zion are modest-in dress, in behavior, in language.&nbsp; They know and live the doctrine that our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The attitude and practice of modesty brings moderation, simplicity, humility, and purity of thought and action.&nbsp; The modest people of Zion avoid sensuality in dress and arrogance and brashness in behavior. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Immodesty in dress, language, and behavior is the way of Babylon.&nbsp; For women this is the world of short skirts, scoop-neck tops, plunging necklines, high-slit skirts, short shorts, and the immoral thoughts and actions that go with them.&nbsp; For men, this is the world of low-slung pants; tank tops; unbuttoned shirts; arrogant, suggestive language; and immoral behavior. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #5:&nbsp; Personal Responsibility</em>
</p>
<p>
We have the Light of Christ, and we have moral agency.&nbsp; Each of us is personally accountable and responsible for our actions and our thoughts according to the light and knowledge we have received.&nbsp; Personal responsibility is essential to repentance and, thus, to the building of Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon the attitude is:&nbsp; The rules don&#39;t apply to me; I am special.&nbsp; The culture of Babylon teaches the rising generation that:&nbsp; &quot;My behavior is not my responsibility.&nbsp; It is socio-economic forces or someone else that makes me do what I do.&quot; &nbsp;In Babylon, no matter what you do, it is always someone else&#39;s fault. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I now turn to the third characteristic of Zion, that there are no poor among them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #6:&nbsp; Sacrifice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
</p>
<p>
In Zion, each person &quot;esteem[s] his brother as himself&quot;<sup><a href="#14" target="_self" target="_self">14</a></sup> and &quot;seek[s] the interest of his neighbor&quot;<sup><a href="#15" target="_self" target="_self">15</a></sup> even if it means a sacrifice of time, resources, or convenience.&nbsp; Following the example of the Son of God, a willingness to sacrifice so that others may be blessed is a hallmark of Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An attitude of entitlement permeates Babylon.&nbsp; Bred by pride and feelings of &quot;victimhood,&quot; the people of Babylon feel that what they have is theirs by right.&nbsp; Not only do they not have to share what they already have, they have a right to get more of what they want.&nbsp; They are entitled. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>Pattern #7:&nbsp; Work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
</p>
<p>
In Zion, work is essential.&nbsp; It is the way we create things of value and take care of each other.&nbsp; It is ennobling and good.&nbsp; In Zion, &quot;the laborer[s] in Zion . . . labor for Zion,&quot;<sup><a href="#16" target="_self" target="_self">16</a></sup> and they work hard.&nbsp;<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
In Babylon, the ideal is something for nothing.&nbsp; Working hard is denigrated.&nbsp; Gambling is celebrated.&nbsp; The smart people of Babylon look for deals where they can take advantage of someone and get something for nothing. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These are patterns of Zion we must teach the rising generation.&nbsp; They need to see, understand, and live the patterns of Zion; and we need to help them recognize and flee from the attitudes and practices and doctrines of Babylon.&nbsp; I believe the key to meeting this challenge is in this statement by Enos, son of Jacob: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man-for he taught me in his language, and also in the <strong><em>nurture and admonition of the Lord</em></strong>-and blessed be the name of my God for it.&quot;<sup><a href="#17" target="_self" target="_self">17 </a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The nurture of the Lord</strong> is His warmth and kindness, support, comfort, lifting and strengthening power; His mercy and grace; His divine encouragement, good cheer, confidence, and hope.&nbsp; The nurture of the Lord is the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; We need to love the rising generation the way the Lord loves them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The admonition of the Lord</strong> is the laws and commandments of the Lord, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the doctrines of salvation, the ordinances and covenants of the temple.&nbsp; The admonition of the Lord is the standard of the gospel.&nbsp; We need to teach doctrine and set high standards for the rising generation, especially by living them ourselves. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These two dimensions combine to create a framework I have found useful in thinking about how to teach and coach young people in the doctrines and the attitudes of Zion.&nbsp; This diagram maps our approach to teaching and coaching the rising generation in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: 
</p>
<p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
With love-low to high-arrayed across the diagram, and setting standards-low to high-arrayed up and down, we get four zones:&nbsp; 1) low love, low standards; 2) high love, low standards; 3) low love, high standards; and 4) high love, high standards. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Whether you are a parent with children at home, a grandparent, a teacher, an advisor, or a Church leader, if you are teaching and coaching and mentoring the rising generation, you need to be in the upper right zone-you need to be in the zone of Zion, the zone of high love and high standards.&nbsp; There are two reasons. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First, the upper right is the only zone where we ourselves are fully living the gospel.&nbsp; It is the only zone where we follow the Lord&#39;s command to love one another, including young people, with the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; It is the only zone where we teach the standards of the gospel by precept and by example, the way the Savior would teach them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Second, the upper right is the only zone where you can teach and coach the patterns of Zion effectively.&nbsp; Think about trying to teach a Zion pattern like forgiveness in any other zone.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t love them and don&#39;t show them that you care for them, you can tell them about forgiveness, even demand that they forgive, but you won&#39;t touch their hearts. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Even if you live the standards, you can&#39;t teach and coach attitudes unless the gospel is getting into their hearts.&nbsp; And if you don&#39;t teach and live the standards by forgiving others, you will not help them see the power of Zion, even if you have great love for them.&nbsp; They will feel your love, but your actions and your words will teach them that forgiveness is not important. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The zone of Zion is the best place to be; but I know from my own experience and the experience of many, many teachers and parents that many of us end up in the other three zones.&nbsp; We end up in the zones of Babylon.&nbsp; Sometimes we get there because we don&#39;t care enough to either nurture or admonish. &nbsp;Sometimes we get there because we emphasize only one of the dimensions of the framework-we love but set the standards too low, or we set high standards but love too little. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Being in the zone of Zion takes courage and discipline and faith.&nbsp; To be there you must do two things at the same time-you must show great love and support and encouragement; and, at the very same time, you must teach doctrine, set high expectations, and hold young people accountable.&nbsp; There are so many examples.&nbsp; When they are very young, you teach them the value of work by making them work.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I can hear the voice of my mother saying, &quot;You can play baseball with your friends, but you have to get your work done first.&quot;&nbsp; When they are older, you teach them to be modest by being modest yourself. You love and support them, but you also expect of them a high standard of dress and behavior, even if that standard is unpopular. You help them to forgive by teaching them the doctrine of the Atonement, including the Savior&#39;s great love for them. You help them feel His love and develop a testimony of Him, and then coach them to forgive those who hurt them.&nbsp; You teach them not to be offended, and you hold them accountable to forgive. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so, my dear brothers and sisters, this is my message: &nbsp;You and I are an important part of the nurture and admonition of the Lord for the rising generation.&nbsp; We can help the rising generation flee Babylon and come to Zion if we will love them and set high standards for them.&nbsp; That means the spirit of Zion must be in our hearts and the patterns of Zion evident in our lives.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The gospel of Jesus Christ must be deep down in our hearts. You and I know.&nbsp; We know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ.&nbsp; We know the gospel has been restored.&nbsp; We know the gospel is true. We know that Zion is being established all across the earth.&nbsp; We know that the patterns of Babylon-even in its rolling hills-lead to misery and heartache and destruction.&nbsp; We know the patterns of Zion will build Zion and that in Zion there is joy, happiness, peace, and power. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
May God bless us to build Zion in our hearts, in our homes, in our wards and branches. And may we bring up the rising generation in the nurture and admonition of the Lord so that the doctrines, attitudes, and practices of Zion will go deep down in their hearts. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I leave you with my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; This is His church and kingdom, restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; It will never be taken from the earth again.&nbsp; It will grow and flourish.&nbsp; With the help of heaven, you and I and the rising generation will accomplish the great work the Lord has for us to do.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Zion will be established in all of her millennial glory, and the Lord will come again to rule and reign, the King of Kings.&nbsp; I bear witness that these things are true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<p>
From the early days of the restoration of the Church, there has been a great day of gathering. In the section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 64, we read: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;That the work of the gathering together of my saints may continue, that I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This gathering of the saints was a literal gathering. It was a harvest of the faithful from all over the world.&nbsp; As members of the church were converted, they left their homes and came to &quot;gather&quot; with the saints, first in the eastern part of the United States where the Church was first established, and later in Utah, where the Church was to be located. They gathered to Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There was great personal sacrifice associated with this gathering.&nbsp; I am reminded of my great grandmother, Petrera Pederson Hougaard.&nbsp; She was only a child, in Denmark, when the missionaries found her family and taught them the gospel.&nbsp; Her father, John Pederson, was a wealthy merchant and when he as converted to the truth, he decided to sell everything he had and gather with the saints in Utah.&nbsp; The family had to leave everything behind.&nbsp; Each child could choose one thing to bring with them, aside from the bare necessities of food and clothing.&nbsp; Petrera chose her little rag doll. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, during the process of settling his affairs, John became aware of others who had joined this new faith.&nbsp; They were desirous of gathering with the saints as well, but they did not have the means to pay for their passage on the ship.&nbsp; John decided to book all of the passages on the ship and bring as many families as he was able.&nbsp; He spent most of his fortune doing so.&nbsp; And so it was that the Pederson family said good- bye to their loved ones, their home and possessions, and their place of birth to come to Zion.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The little family had many hardships along the way.&nbsp; While at sea, two of Petrera&#39;s younger siblings contracted the dread disease of small pox.&nbsp; They both died and had to be buried at sea.&nbsp; Then as they began their long journey across the plains in an ox pulled wagon, they were delayed because their mother gave birth to a baby that also died and was buried along the trail.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These things were very hard for the family, but Petrera had her own little personal trails as well.&nbsp; She told in her later years of how tired she was on this long journey because she had to walk most of the time.&nbsp; Finally, her father lifted her onto the neck of one of the oxen to ride.&nbsp; She was mortally afraid of the huge animal, but she decided she was more tired than she was afraid, so that is where she stayed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
On another occasion, Indians approached the group of travelers.&nbsp; Frightening stories of what might happen to them were surely paramount in their thoughts as the leader of the Indian band rode past them looking them over.&nbsp; Finally he rode back to where Petrera stood with her father.&nbsp; He made them understand that he wanted the little rag doll clutched in her hands for his own daughter.&nbsp; Petreria had no choice but to give it to him.&nbsp; Then the Indians rode off, leaving them unharmed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Finally the family arrived in Salt Lake City.&nbsp; They felt great relief at having completed their long trek. They longed for a time of rest.&nbsp; But it was not to be so.&nbsp; After just a short time in the valley, they were assigned by Brigham Young to travel south to settle the Manti area.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It was late in the fall, and by the time they got there, there was no time to build homes.&nbsp; And so they built dugouts against the cliffs, in an area that is now just east of the Manti Temple.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The winter was harsh, but they survived, if just barely.&nbsp; And when the spring came, they looked forward to it with great anticipation.&nbsp; This excitement, however, was soon overcome with concerns for safety, because they began to find large rattlesnakes everywhere - in their beds, in cupboards, above their doors.&nbsp; It seems that these snakes had been hibernating in the rocks, and were now coming to life in the warm weather.&nbsp; Petrera&#39;s father and other men in the group decided to hunt them down.&nbsp; They found the snakes rolled into great balls containing hundreds of snakes in caves in the cliffs.&nbsp; They pushed sagebrush into the openings of the caves and then set them on fire.&nbsp; The miracle was that not one person died from snakebite. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
They continued to work hard for many years to build their homes, farms, the little community of Manti and then the temple.&nbsp; Sacrifice and service was part of their every day lives.&nbsp; But to them, coming to Zion, gathering to be with the Saints and having the blessings of the Temple was the most important thing.&nbsp; It was because of their great faith in Jesus Christ and their great love for Him.&nbsp; They were not just gathering to Zion, they were gathering to Him.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Many of you may have similar stories in your families.&nbsp; Some of you may be the first members of the Church in your families.&nbsp; But I am sure all of us wonder how these early Pioneers could have done what they did?&nbsp; We wonder if we would have had the same kind of strength and faith? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This principle of &quot;gathering&quot; is an eternal principle. We are bound by it just as were the early saints. Now,we are not asked to gather in the same way as they were, so let&#39;s look a little further into why they &quot;gathered&quot; as they did and what &quot;gathering&quot; means for us. In 1 Nephi 22:25 we read: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture&quot;.&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the early days of the church, the &quot;gathering&quot; was for the purpose of building up the strength of Zion.&nbsp; It was for the purpose of building temples and gathering to them in order to receive the ordinances of the Lord.&nbsp; This was done physically as the members of the Church gathered in large groups.&nbsp; It was also done spiritually as individuals increased in faith as they sacrificed for the Lord.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I remember hearing of a fast and testimony meeting where members of the Church were talking about the terrible sacrifices made by the Martin-Willie Handcart Company.&nbsp; There was even a little criticism about the fact that the company had started their trek so late in the year.&nbsp; At the very back of the hall, an old man stood to bear his testimony.&nbsp; He had been a survivor of that handcart company when he had been a young boy.&nbsp; He expressed his great love for the Lord, and his gratitude for having had the privilege to sacrifice so much.&nbsp; He declared that it was that very sacrifice that built the faith that he felt so strongly these many years later. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Today we have members all around the world and we gather differently.&nbsp; New members are not asked to leave their homes and come to Utah.&nbsp; Rather, we gather in branches, wards and stakes in our own areas.&nbsp; But we gather for the same reasons as did our fore fathers as they gathered to Zion.&nbsp; We gather to establish the church. We gather to the temples.&nbsp; We gather to establish the gospel in our own hearts.&nbsp; We gather to be strengthened by one another and by the Spirit. We have come to understand that the word &quot;Zion&quot; means pure in heart, and so we &quot;gather&quot; in order to purify ourselves before the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, this kind of &quot;gathering&quot; does not generally require the same kind of sacrifice as did the &quot;gathering&quot; of the early saints.&nbsp; But today, may I suggest, that the word &quot;gathering&quot; may have a deeper meaning for us as individuals.&nbsp; And it may require a different kind of sacrifice. I would like to begin by asking some questions.&nbsp; First, what does it mean to us, individually, to &quot;gather&quot;? To whom do we &quot;gather&quot;? What is our &quot;gathering place&quot;? And, what are the blessings we receive as we &quot;gather&quot;? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First, let us consider what it means to us individually to &quot;gather&quot;.&nbsp; In the D &amp; C 86:7 we read: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares....&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This scripture refers to gathering the righteous saints out of the wickedness of the world.&nbsp; But we are already members of the Church, so what does this mean for us? Could it mean that we must &quot;gather&quot; ourselves away from the influence of the world.&nbsp; And if so, then each of us might ask the question &quot;what must I do to &quot;gather&quot; myself &quot;out&quot; and be counted in the Lord&#39;s harvest?&quot;&nbsp; And, &quot;what kinds of sacrifices will I have to make?&quot;&nbsp; This may mean that each of us will need to really look at how we live and how exact we are in obeying the commandments of the Lord.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We have lots of direction and help from our Heavenly Father in doing this.&nbsp; But let&#39;s just read in D &amp; C 84: 43-45: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;And now I give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
Heavenly Father has given us many specific commandments, but he also teaches us how to discern what is right and what is wrong.&nbsp; In this scripture, I love the idea of truth being light and wickedness or worldliness being dark.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I saw a vivid representation of this when I visited church members in Africa.&nbsp; We were traveling into the bush country in Kenya.&nbsp; We had to travel in a four-wheel drive vehicle because of the condition of the roads, or the lack thereof. Our goal was to visit a small branch.&nbsp; The countryside, or the &quot;world&quot; was very harsh.&nbsp; There was a famine in the land and the people were suffering.&nbsp; We traveled through dessert and then rugged bush country.&nbsp; We drove through dry creek beds, past small isolated villages where the children ran alongside our car and the adults sat idly by the roadside. &nbsp;We drove through wooded areas where we saw simple, small homes, maybe 12&#39; by 12&#39;, made of brush and scrap wood or pieces of corrugated metal, which housed large families as well as orphaned neighbor children.&nbsp; We saw animals that were skin and bone and people who looked no better.&nbsp; We saw people whose lives were as drab and brown as the dirt in which they lived.&nbsp; Then, as we drove through the trees, we came around a bend in the road, and there was a beautiful little LDS chapel.&nbsp; It was all white and was landscaped with green lawn, and flowers.&nbsp; There was a low iron fence surrounding it.&nbsp; The chapel was in stark contrast to everything else around it. It was clean and beautiful and seemed to glow in the sunlight.&nbsp; You could feel the spirit that resided there. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The people gathered there, waiting for us, were different from the other people we had seen as well.&nbsp; They were dressed in their Sunday best, even though it was a Saturday.&nbsp; They were clean, reverent and radiated the Spirit.&nbsp; They were smiling and happy!&nbsp; They were there as families, eager to be taught.&nbsp; These humble people had brought themselves &quot;out&quot; of their world and &quot;gathered&quot; to the light.&nbsp; I was stunned by the image they represented. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, we live in a dark and dreary world where evil influences lurk on every side.&nbsp; Satan and his followers will stop at nothing to have our very souls, and will use any tool that is available to them to pull us down.&nbsp; It is all together too easy for us to become complacent in living the gospel the way the Lord would have us do.&nbsp; It is too easy to rationalize our behavior and not only live in the world, but of the world to one degree or another. It is too easy to become discouraged with our challenges. It is too easy to get mixed up with the &quot;tares&quot;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
So each of us must ask, &quot;What must I sacrifice to &quot;gather&quot; out of the dark world, and come to the &quot;light&quot;?&nbsp; What in my life must I change in order to be part of the Lord&#39;s harvest? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our Heavenly Father has given us many wonderful principles of the gospel that will help us come back to Him. The law of the Sabbath day, the commandment to be unspotted from the world, the principle of charity, the doctrines of service, sacrifice, and obedience are but a few, but they are all principles of the gospel, that if lived fully, will draw us closer to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.&nbsp; How well do we really live them?&nbsp; Do we do it with &quot;exactness&quot;, or do we quite literally live with one foot on each side of the fence?&nbsp; We can&#39;t be &quot;gathered&quot; with the wheat, if we are interlaced with &quot;tares&quot;.&nbsp; We must be willing to sacrifice worldly pleasures if we would have eternal blessings. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I would like to use two of these principles of the gospel as examples. Let us first consider the principle and then let us each evaluate how well we are living it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First, let us talk about the Sabbath Day.&nbsp; What is the Law concerning the Sabbath day?&nbsp; In Mosiah 13:16 we read the basic law: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Then in the 59<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants we find further instruction about how we &quot;remember&quot; and how we &quot;keep it holy&quot;:&nbsp; (vs. 9 - 16) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; 
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the most high.&quot; &quot;Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times;&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;But remember that on this, the Lord&#39;s day, thou shalt offer thine oblations (o<em>fferings, whether of time</em>, <em>talents, or means, in service of God and fellowman.</em> <em>TG sacrifice</em>) and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.&quot;(<em>repenting)</em>
</p>
<p>
	&quot;And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or in other words, that thy joy may be full.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing and prayer.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance&quot; - 
	</p>
<p>
	&quot;Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fullness of the earth is yours...&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When you consider these scriptures, we can see that by following them, exactly, we would be able to &quot;gather&quot; ourselves out of the world. But, now, let us evaluate ourselves. Is this really the way we live the law of the Sabbath day?&nbsp; I am sure we do the first part - go to church and partake of the sacrament. But, what about the rest?&nbsp; After we get home from Church, do we really rest from our everyday labors like housework, washing, ironing, yard work, work from the office or studies? Do we offer up our oblations to the Lord by serving in whatever calling we have received with commitment and dedication? Do we reach out to those in need on this holy day? Do we understand that the Sabbath day is a day to spiritually rise high?&nbsp; Do we really offer up our devotion to the Most High by focusing our activities of the day on Him rather than on things of the world like watching sports on TV?&nbsp; Do we gather our family and friends around us in appropriate ways on this day?&nbsp; And do we do all of this with cheerful hearts and countenances because we genuinely find joy in doing the Lord&#39;s will?&nbsp; In Isaiah 58:13-14 we read: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;If thou turn away....from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, or finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth...&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now for some of us, making a commitment to live the law of the Sabbath day like this may take some sacrifice.&nbsp; We may have to sacrifice some of the pleasures of the world. We will have to sacrifice our sins! But as hard as this might be, the promised blessing is surely worth it.&nbsp; And I truly believe that as we make these sacrifices, we will soon feel like the old man who was grateful for the sacrifices that were required of him.&nbsp; We will see the hand of the Lord in our lives and we will be so grateful for the opportunity to be &quot;gathered&quot; in body and in spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The second principle we will consider today, is keeping ourselves &quot;unspotted from the World&quot;.&nbsp; What does it mean to be unspotted from the world?&nbsp; Naturally our first answer is that we are to be morally clean and chaste in our lives.&nbsp; But does being &quot;unspotted&quot; mean more than just overt sin?&nbsp; Could it mean that we are to shun all things that draw us into sin at any level?&nbsp; Could it mean that sinning vicariously by watching things on television or in movies that might be suggestive or light minded should be avoided? Could it mean that we should not read or look at material that is representative of the values of the world? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And what about being &quot;unspotted&quot; from the materialism of the world?&nbsp; While we know that the good things of the earth are for our comfort and blessing, do we get so focused on obtaining and then maintaining them that we put more emphasis on them than on things of the kingdom? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These are hard questions, but what it comes down to is this - &quot; Am I willing to be strictly obedient to the commandments and principles of the Gospel so that I might &quot;gather&quot; myself out of the world.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Am I willing to sacrifice the things of the world for the things of God?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our ability to &quot;gather&quot; ourselves out of the world comes only through the atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ. It is with his help that we are able to change our actions and our hearts.&nbsp; The atonement has been made, it is up to us to allow it to correct us, heal us, strengthen us, and bring us peace and joy.&nbsp; This then, is the answer to the second question - &quot;To whom do we &quot;gather&quot;?&nbsp; We gather out of the world to the Savior<em>.</em> We read the words of the Savior in D&amp;C 10:65: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;For, behold, I will gather them as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not harden their hearts;&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Think of that image - being gathered gently, kindly, with great love, to a place of safety and peace.&nbsp; Feel the shelter, the warmth, the security.&nbsp; Feel the sweet society with others who are gathered there.&nbsp; Feel the sweet contentment we could have in the presence of the Savior. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, the path that takes is out of the world is clear for us.&nbsp; The way is only hard when we try to hang onto the world that surrounds us.&nbsp; If we let go and allow the Savior to carry us along, the way is easy and sweet. He makes it easy.&nbsp; We make it hard. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We gain in strength with each good choice we make as we work along.&nbsp; I believe it is a process.&nbsp; Some days are harder than others, but as long as we are moving in the right direction and making progress, we will have the Lord&#39;s help.&nbsp; He did not just place us down here on this earth and say &quot;Now come back to me - good luck&quot;.&nbsp; No, he has provided the way.&nbsp; He made the atonement.&nbsp; He has given us the gospel.&nbsp; He had given us the Holy Ghost, who can be our constant companion, to help us.&nbsp; And he had given us gathering places to bless us. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This then, takes us to our third question, &quot;Where is our gathering place?&quot; If we are gathering to the Savior, that place must be a sacred place.&nbsp; Our homes are sacred.&nbsp; The chapel is sacred.&nbsp; And of course ultimately the temple is sacred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these places can give us protection and refuge from the world.&nbsp; Each of these places, if filled with the Spirit, will strengthen our effort to remain free from the world.&nbsp; Living a better life in our homes and in our church worship, prepares us to enter the temple. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is in the temple that the Lord can teach us.&nbsp; It is there that we are able to make covenants with the Lord that deepen our understanding and secure our place with Him. It is through the temple that we are able to truly come to Him.&nbsp;It is in the temple that we can secure our families for eternity. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Attending the temple, often, is a wonderful gift that our Heavenly Father has given us.&nbsp; It allows us to serve, but it also allows us to bask in his love, to feel the spirit, and to find peace in our lives.&nbsp; We are lifted, taught, and strengthened in the temple.&nbsp; The pathway to the Savior is through the temple.<em> </em>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And, we do not just come to the temple, enjoy the blessings there and then leave them behind when we return home. We must take the temple with us into our everyday lives to strengthen us no matter where we may be.&nbsp; In that way every place we go can be a holy place, because we have become holy. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And what are the blessings of &quot;gathering&quot; ourselves out of the world to the Savior? There are so many blessings that come when we dedicate our lives to the Lord.&nbsp; Those blessings come every minute of every day as we see the hand of the Lord in our lives - protecting us, guiding us, strengthening us, helping us through difficult experiences. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The other day as I was praying in gratitude for some very specific blessings that had come to our family, and in the same breath pleading with the Heavenly Father for specific blessings we are desperately in need of, it occurred to me that life is a little like the ebb and flow of the tide.&nbsp; Blessings are constantly flowing to us, and challenges are constantly threatening to overwhelm us. They flow in and out of our lives, keeping us constantly on our knees before the Lord.&nbsp; But as we keep our covenants and strive to keep the commandments with exactness, as surely as a need arises, blessings wash in.&nbsp; It is sure.&nbsp; It is constant. It is eternal. We are being gathered in. We are told in D&amp;C 39:22: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;And he that receiveth these things (the gospel) receiveth me; and they shall be gathered unto me in time and in eternity.&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, I know that we have a loving Father in Heaven. He lives and He loves us so much that He sent his only begotten Son to atone for us and make it possible for us to live forever in his presence.&nbsp; I know that this is His plan for us and that part of the plan is opposition that causes us to deepen our faith, our commitment and our obedience.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Because we are surrounded by the temptations of the flesh, and because the &quot;the time of harvest is come&quot;, we must, with conviction and courage, &quot;gather&quot; ourselves out of the world. We must work to gather our families out of the world and make our homes a place of refuge. We must &quot;gather&quot; together with one another for strength and safety.&nbsp; We must &quot;gather&quot; to the Lord, through His holy temple. We can do this!&nbsp; Only then, when the Harvest is over, will we find ourselves safe and secure in the presence of the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

During the past weeks I have fasted and prayed for the guidance of the Spirit, that I might come to understand the message the Lord would share with you today. I pray that the Holy Ghost will help us learn together and that those who have come seeking answers will feel God&#39;s love for them, as &quot;we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, [and] we preach of Christ<sup>&quot;<a href="#1" target="_self" target="_self">1</a></sup>.

When I was a little girl our Primary put on an annual &quot;Life of Christ&quot; pageant. Twelve boys played apostles, but there weren&#39;t many roles for girls. One year I played Pontius Pilate&#39;s wife. Loaded with costume jewelry, a diamond dangling on my forehead, I ran on stage to plead for a prisoner because of a dream<sup><a href="#2" target="_self" target="_self">2</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The role I wanted least but remember best was a Foolish Virgin. We were given wooden lamps, but only five lamps had a yellow flame. I remember being teased by my oldest, tallest, brother-who also played the role of Christ-about being one of the foolish five. In our scene the 10 virgins gathered at the back of the stage, and when &quot;the bridegroom came&quot;<sup><a href="#4" target="_self" target="_self">3</a></sup> a big crowd surrounded Jesus and walked across the stage, &quot;and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage&quot;. The five wise virgins joined the celebration and exited with the crowd of disciples and a loud bang signaled &quot;the door was shut&quot;. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One performance is a powerful memory. When the door slammed and the lights went out, and the five foolish virgins were left alone on a darkened stage, it wasn&#39;t my playful older brother, in a glued on beard and white robe, behind a closed door. It was Jesus, and my child&#39;s heart ached to join him. I did not want to be alone in the black, shut out because I was not prepared, was not worthy. I yearned to be a disciple and follow Him. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Since that defining moment as a Primary child, when I stood on a dark stage holding an empty lamp, additional experiences have fortified my desire to stay on the path. As I share some of my experiences with you my prayer is that we will come to recognize some of the steps we need to take on the path of discipleship, and encourage one another, to &quot;walk the path that [he] hast shown&quot;. Together I hope we&#39;ll learn of the blessings offered at BYU-I that can help us &quot;[find] strength beyond [our] own&quot;<sup><a href="#4" target="_self" target="_self">4</a></sup> to heed the call in 2 Nephi 31:10 &quot;Follow thou me.&quot; 
</p>

<p>
Five years ago this week David A. Bednar (2004) gave the first devotional talk of Fall Semester, &quot;A Disciple Preparation Center.&quot; It was to be his last devotional address before his call as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. Elder Bednar defines a disciple as &quot;a follower of Jesus who learns of and from Him and lives according to His teachings&quot;. When I heard President Bednar&#39;s talk I was nudged to go beyond a definition of the word disciple and ask myself, &quot;What does it <em>mean</em> to <em>be</em> a disciple?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A large print of this painting by Carl Bloch hangs in the Rexburg Temple. In it the Savior seems to tenderly invite all of us to &quot;Follow thou me&quot;<sup><a href="#5" target="_self" target="_self">5</a></sup>. During my shift as a temple worker I have often had occasion to reflect on what Bloch teaches us about heeding the Savior&#39;s words and following him. (My thanks to Brother Leon Parson for sharing with me his artistic insights about Bloch&#39;s work.) 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This is what I see: Of the 31 faces and heads in the painting only 25 percent appear focused on the Savior. Some scowl, others turn away. A woman&#39;s head is bowed in godly sorrow, while on her coif a young girl&#39;s two fingers are poised to capture one of the Lord&#39;s creations, too spiritually immature to recognize she is in the presence of <em>the</em> Creator. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A teenager glares at the little girl, disdainful of her attempt to catch the butterfly. A grandmother in the crowd watches the child, as if pleading for the girl to pay attention to the Master, while the figure at the Savior&#39;s feet gazes with fervent adoration and appears to listen attentively. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I look at this painting I am prompted to ask myself: &quot;Am I distracted by the world? Am I paying attention? Am I listening? Do I hear and obey? Does my life reflect His?&quot; Sadly, too many days I recognize my need to repent of weaknesses and shortcomings, that I have wandered off the path and become encumbered in the darkened mists of impatience and pride. I am humbly grateful for the Atonement&#39;s daily opportunity to repent and try harder. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Turn with me to Matthew 22:37-40: &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.&quot; Loving God with all our heart, soul, and mind sets us on the path of discipleship. But we cannot love Him if we do not know Him. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Maxwell (2004) taught that to be a disciple the &quot;first commandment includes all of our heart, soul, and mind.... we will have missed the train if Jesus is a stranger and far from the thoughts and intents of our heart.&quot; If we do not want the Savior to be a stranger, and &quot;far from...our hearts&quot; we must know him and reflect often on his life, his example, and his atoning sacrifice. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A few years ago I was doing some scholarly research on the role of reflection in the learning process. I made the connection that the world advises us to <em>reflect </em>while the parallel word in gospel language is <em>remember</em>. My research helped me recognize that too often I took the sacrament on Sunday, left church, and then for days did not think about the covenant I had renewed to &quot;eat in remembrance of the body&quot; of my Savior and &quot;always remember him and keep his commandments&quot;<a href="#6" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While reading 3 Nephi 18:7 I recognized my need to improve:&nbsp; &quot;And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.&quot; I wanted to have his Spirit with me, but recognized that I struggled to always remember him. In order to love the Lord with all my heart, mind, and soul, I searched for an answer to the question, &quot;What can I do to remember the Savior&#39;s body, and the covenants I renew by partaking of the sacrament, throughout the week?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I reflected on how I could better remember my Savior, and the sacrifice and suffering of his body for the Atonement, one day I watched my granddaughter learning to say the parts of the body in both Spanish and English. Elena loved to sing &quot;Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,&quot;<sup> </sup>&quot;Cabeza, hombros, rodillas, y dedos,&quot; pointing to each body part. As I listened to her song, images of the Savior flooded my heart and helped me recall his body, his life, and his love for me.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
First, his head. The Savior taught, &quot;foxes have holes, but the Son of Man hath not wherewith to lay his head&quot;<sup><a href="#7" target="_self" target="_self">7</a></sup>. After a mock trial, Pilate ordered the Savior scourged-39 lashes with leather thongs tipped with bone and metal, meant to dig into skin, then tear and shred flesh and muscle as the thongs were dragged across the back<sup><a href="#8" target="_self" target="_self">8</a></sup>. Then upon his head the soldiers placed a crown of plaited thorns. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
His shoulders would have been strong-carpenters in Jesus&#39; time not only fashioned wood, but cut and harvested their own logs-strong enough to carry timber, steady enough to carry a lamb. After the scourging, jeering soldiers placed upon his shoulders a purple robe. Finally, upon his shoulders, John<sup> </sup>tells us, &quot;And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull&quot;. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Savior had healing hands. &quot;He put forth his hand, and touched [a leper]&quot;<sup><a href="#9" target="_self" target="_self">9</a></sup> and he was healed; he touched the eyes of two blind men, and &quot;immediately their eyes received sight&quot;<sup><a href="#10" target="_self" target="_self">10</a></sup>. &quot;He took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them...and they did all eat&quot;<sup><a href="#11" target="_self" target="_self">11</a></sup>. He fed the 4,000. He fed the 5,000. &quot;He touched&quot; the hand of Peter&#39;s mother-in-law, &quot;and the fever left her&quot;<sup><a href="#12" target="_self" target="_self">12</a></sup>. His hands &quot;made clay...and he anointed the eyes of the blind man&quot;<sup><a href="#13" target="_self" target="_self">13</a></sup>. They drew in the dirt, to calm a murderous crowd, and save a woman scorned, from death<sup><a href="#14" target="_self" target="_self">14</a></sup>. His hand reached and &quot;took the damsel by the hand&quot; and the daughter of Jairus rose and walked<sup><a href="#15" target="_self" target="_self">15</a></sup>. &quot;Jesus stretched forth his hand&quot; and caught Peter as he sank into the sea<sup><a href="#16" target="_self" target="_self">16</a></sup>. On Calvary nails were driven into his hands. The Nephites would all come forth and feel the marks in his palms<sup><a href="#17" target="_self" target="_self">17</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I take the time to <em>remember</em>, my capacity to love the Lord with all my heart, and with all my soul, and with all my mind grows and I am on the path to discipleship. &quot;Head, shoulders, knees, and toes.&quot; He knelt before his Twelve Apostles and washed their feet. With the Nephites, &quot;he himself also knelt upon the earth; and... he prayed unto the Father&quot;<sup><a href="#18" target="_self" target="_self">18</a></sup>. And in Gethsemane, &quot;he... kneeled down, and prayed...and being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground&quot;<sup><a href="#19" target="_self" target="_self">19</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
His feet walked many miles on dusty roads, climbed mountains, walked on water, and wandered in the wilderness for 40 days. A devoted disciple washed his feet with her tears. And in the end his feet carried his bruised and bleeding body to a lonely hill called Calvary, there to be pierced by nails. During the hours on the cross, with his full body weight pulling on his arms, he stood on the nails in his feet, to lift his body so he could draw air into his lungs; most victims on the cross suffered death by suffocation<sup><a href="#20" target="_self" target="_self">20</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Primary song ends with &quot;Eye, ears, mouth, and nose,&quot; &quot;Ojos, o&iacute;dos, boca, y nariz.&quot;&nbsp; From a&nbsp;spot on the Mount of Olives, his eyes beheld his city and wept &quot;O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem!&quot; Just days later, he looked down from the cross to see his mother, and commissioned her care to John. With his voice, &quot;He cast out [evil] spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick&quot;. He spoke truth, prayed for the sinner, calmed the waves, and commanded the grave to open and Lazarus to come forth. He preached faith, repentance, baptism, love, and forgiveness. In agony he uttered, &quot;It is finished, Thy will be done&quot;. Then on the third day, in a sacred garden, he softly spoke a single word to a weeping woman, &quot;Mary&quot;.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Nephites all came forward, one by one, to feel the prints in the Savior&#39;s hands and feet<sup><a href="#21" target="_self" target="_self">21</a></sup>. He reminded them of that experience, when he said in 3 Nephi 18:7: &quot;my body, which I have shown unto you.&quot; Elder Holland says, &quot;In fact, in a resurrected, otherwise perfected body, our Lord has chosen to retain for the benefit of his disciples the wounds in his hands and his feet and his side-signs that painful things happen even to the pure and perfect.&quot; Those very marks of his love remind us that he remembers us: &quot;Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet&quot;<sup><a href="#22" target="_self" target="_self">22</a></sup>. &quot;I will not forget thee. I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands&quot;<sup><a href="#23" target="_self" target="_self">23</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The body we remember when we partake of the sacrament was born in simple grandeur to Mary, as a tiny babe in a stable, with animals in attendance, a manger for his bed. Elder Holland<sup> </sup>(1995) says that during Christ&#39;s life that same body &quot;suffered pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind that he might be filled with mercy and know how to succor his people in their infirmities&quot;. And when a young boy named Joseph knelt in a grove of trees, that same body, gloriously resurrected, appeared in answer to a humble pleading, &quot;which of all the sects is right...and which I should join&quot;. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Reflecting on the Primary song &quot;Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,&quot; helps me remember the body of Christ. When I partake of the sacrament I think of a head crowned with thorns, shoulders burdened by a cross, knees bent in prayer, and feet pierced by nails. When I allow those images to fill my heart I come a little closer to heeding the first commandment: &quot;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength&quot;<sup><a href="#24" target="_self" target="_self">24</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Another step on our journey toward discipleship is the commandment to love our neighbor. In April Conference 2009 President Uchtdorf taught us in his address &quot;The Way of the Disciple,&quot; that &quot;The more we are filled with the Spirit of God, the more we extend ourselves to others. We become peacemakers in our homes and families, we help our fellowmen everywhere, and we reach out in merciful acts of kindness, forgiveness, grace, and long-suffering patience. These are the first steps along the...way of the follower of Jesus Christ&quot;<sup><a href="#25" target="_self" target="_self">25</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Speaking to BYU students, President Hinckley (1997) said, &quot;I hope that you are developing a great desire to walk in the footsteps of the Master, to reach out to those in distress, to serve the Church with great faithfulness, and to serve your fellowmen in a spirit of love and consecration.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We are blessed at BYU-Idaho to enjoy the &quot;miracle&quot; of a temple on the hill (Eyring, 2009), where we can worship the Lord. In the temple we first make and keep sacred covenants, and then we have the privilege to return to serve our neighbors; attending the temple provides us opportunities to fulfill the second great commandment, &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&quot;<sup><a href="#26" target="_self" target="_self">26</a></sup>. Service in the temple helps us progress along our journey of discipleship. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For the past year I have been blessed to serve as an ordinance worker in the Rexburg Temple where I have weekly witnessed what it means to &quot;love your neighbor.&quot; Volunteers come to the temple to care for the physical facilities and provide clothing, record ordinances, and clean the rooms. Patrons come to the temple to serve the dead, performing ordinances for those who have passed on. I have observed tender acts of service as patrons assist other patrons. Ordinance workers do all they can to help patrons have an uplifting experience. There is no place on earth where people are more kind, more gentle, more tender, or more happy! The temple is where I have come to more fully understand the words of the Hymn #220, &quot;Lord, I Would Follow Thee&quot;: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
		1. Savior, may I learn to love thee,<br />
		Walk the path that thou hast shown,<br />
		Pause to help and lift another,<br />
		Finding strength beyond my own.<br />
		Savior, may I learn to love thee-Lord, I would follow thee. 
		</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;
		</p>
<p>
		4. Savior, may I love my brother<br />
		As I know thou lovest me,<br />
		Find in thee my strength, my beacon,<br />
		For thy servant I would be.<br />
		Savior, may I love my brother-Lord, I would follow thee. 
		</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I have served in the temple, and there witnessed loving acts of service, I have come to know that the temple truly is the House of the Lord and He is home. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A third step on the path of discipleship is obedience. In Second Nephi the Savior &quot;said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.&quot; Then Nephi asked, &quot;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?&quot;<sup><a href="#27" target="_self" target="_self">27</a></sup>. As we learn to love the Lord, and love our neighbor, we must then be willing to keep the commandments. The Lord said, &quot;Therefore, follow<strong> me,</strong> and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto you&quot;<sup><a href="#28" target="_self" target="_self">28</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
During my rebellious teenage years I did not always want to listen to the counsel I was given. When I graduated from high school I wanted to attend a college where I could experience my freedom; even though my two older brothers attended BYU I did not want to attend a church school with what I saw as a rigid honor code. One reason was that my parents had strict rules about appropriate church attire and did not allow any casual clothes on Sunday. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This rule was especially challenging when I was a little girl because we wore dresses to school all week so girls particularly eagerly anticipated weekends so they could wear jeans and shorts. But on Sundays at my house my sister and I wore church dresses all day and my brothers wore shirts and ties. While other children rode bikes and played ball we played croquet in the backyard and board games in the house. I chafed at the rule and couldn&#39;t wait to go to college and wear what I wanted to wear-especially on Sundays. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
My first Sunday at Utah State I was delighted to change into jeans after my meetings. But lounging around the dorm in torn levis and a tee shirt was not the anticipated relaxing experience. Physically and spiritually I didn&#39;t feel right. I discovered I was not comfortable departing from the habit developed as a child. From my youth I had been taught that the Sabbath lasted the entire day, not just the hours I spent at church, and if I meant to &quot;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy&quot; then for <em>me</em> that meant dressing appropriately. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That was the only Sunday I changed into casual clothes. Elder Oaks said in 2008, &quot;How we dress is an important indicator of our attitude and preparation for any activity in which we will engage. If we are going swimming or hiking or playing on the beach, our clothing, including our footwear, will indicate this. The same should be true of how we dress when we are to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament. It is like going to the temple. Our manner of dress indicates the degree to which we understand and honor the ordinance in which we will participate.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
From my parents I had been taught the law of the Sabbath, and dressing appropriately for the ordinance of the sacrament, and I could not turn away from it-even when my meetings were over: &quot;He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple&quot;<sup><a href="#29" target="_self" target="_self">29</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
What does whether or not I got to wear play clothes on Sunday when I was a little girl mean for us at BYU-Idaho? Elder Bednar taught: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
		A disciple of Christ is one who is following and learning to be like Christ-learning to think, to feel, and to act as He does....Discipleship demands the total transformation of a person by putting off the natural man and becoming a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord. A disciple is one who loves the Lord and serves Him with all of his or her heart, mind, might, and strength.<sup><a href="#30" target="_self" target="_self">30</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Honoring my parents, and obeying their counsel, transformed me. A rule I found restrictive as a youth became a behavior that brought me comfort and peace as an adult. My next year at Utah State I experienced another defining moment. I met a tall, handsome, returned missionary and we fell in love. He proposed and together we picked out a ring. With his entire savings he paid cash for the diamond. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
On a clear Sunday evening in January we drove to the grounds of the Logan Temple where we intended to become formally engaged. The white gold diamond ring slipped from between the pages of Sections 131 and 132 and fell into the freshly fallen snow. We searched for hours beneath the moonlight, alternately weeping and praying. Finally, we huddled in one of&nbsp;the temple wall alcoves, and fervently prayed for the ring&#39;s recovery. We promised the Lord that we would consecrate our lives to him. We promised to attend the temple monthly, pay our tithing, and fulfill our callings.&nbsp; The hour was late and we sadly returned to our apartments. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The miracle was not that it didn&#39;t snow that night, nor that the next morning a friend plucked the diamond from the snow, just a foot away from where we had searched. The miracle was that the Lord gave us an transforming opportunity to identify the kind of lives we would live and solemnly promise to be obedient. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At BYU-I Student Honor can help us transform from the natural man and become the saint Elder Bednar describes if we will follow its precepts. President Clark describes Student Honor this way: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
		The first key element of Student Honor is the Code of Honor: the standards and principles common to all CES institutions. These include living a chaste and virtuous life, obeying the Word of Wisdom, being honest in our dealings with our fellow men, attending church, and living a Christ-like life. Other elements of Student Honor include the dress and grooming standards and housing guidelines. These help define the atmosphere where students live and study, and where employees work. The purpose of Student Honor is both to prepare our students to be disciples of the Savior and to protect them and the university from evil.<sup><a href="#31" target="_self" target="_self">31</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It was difficult for me as a child to wear dresses on Sunday when it seemed all my friends were outside playing. And it is a challenge to meet the standards of Student Honor. But the Savior promises us that if we will follow him we &quot;shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&quot;<sup><a href="#32" target="_self" target="_self">32</a></sup>. Nephi taught his people that the Savior showed us the straitness of the path and the narrowness of the gate and set an example for us, and then &quot;said unto the children of men: Follow<strong> </strong>thou<strong> me</strong>&quot;<sup><a href="#33" target="_self" target="_self">33</a></sup>. Nephi then asked his people, &quot;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow<strong> </strong>Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At BYU-Idaho Student Honor is an invitation to follow the Savior and demonstrate our obedience. President Clark (2007) taught, &quot;Obedience to the commandments of the Lord and to the standards and guidelines that define the framework of Student Honor is fundamental to discipleship. An environment of obedience is crucial to the development of disciples.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Neal A. Maxwell (2000) taught, &quot;The submission of one&#39;s will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God&#39;s altar...The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in God&#39;s will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship.&quot;<sup><a href="#34" target="_self" target="_self">34</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder Wirthlin (1994) &quot;obedience is not always easy. In fact, it can sometimes seem stifling, uncomfortable, or even impossible. &lsquo;But with God all things are possible&#39;. You can be obedient.&quot;<sup><a href="#35" target="_self" target="_self">35</a></sup>&nbsp;&quot;Discipleship requires all of us to translate doctrines, covenants, ordinances, and teachings into improved personal behavior&quot; (Maxwell, 1996)<sup><a href="#36" target="_self" target="_self">36</a></sup>. I recognize submitting our will to the Savior and following Him is challenging, but Elder Uchtdorf promises, &quot;From the very moment we set foot upon the pathway of discipleship, seen and unseen blessings from God begin to attend us&quot;<sup><a href="#37" target="_self" target="_self">37</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
President Hinckley said to BYU students (1997) &quot;I hope that the BYU experience will cause you to take on those qualities that will make of you a true disciple of Jesus.&quot; <sup><a href="#38" target="_self" target="_self">38&nbsp;</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Following the pathway of discipleship is a journey we take every day and we are blessed at BYU-Idaho to have a temple and Student Honor to help us along our way. But we should not get discouraged if we sometimes we hit a roadblock, or step off the path. We should not get disheartened by those times we are less patient, less loving, less forgiving than we know we can and should be. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I celebrate the words of Elder Wirthlin (2007), &quot;Oh, it is wonderful to know that our Heavenly Father loves us-even with all our flaws! His love is such that even should we give up on ourselves, He never will...The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of transformation. It takes us as men and women of the earth and refines us into men and women for the eternities&quot;. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The first time I renewed my temple recommend the member of the stake presidency who interviewed me was Val R. Christensen, now president of the Rexburg Temple. In the interview he asked me: &quot;What have you done during the past year that makes you more qualified today than you were a year ago for a temple recommend?&quot; Startled by this unexpected question I quickly reviewed the past year to determine if<em> </em>I <em>had </em>improved my life during the previous twelve months. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That interview became a defining moment for me; every time I have renewed my recommend since I pause to reflect on my life and am prepared to answer President Christensen&#39;s question (even though no priesthood leader has ever asked me again) because I know the Lord wants to know if I am living the kind of life that will qualify me to follow the bridal party. And I truly desire to make my life a journey toward discipleship, my lamp trimmed and burning brightly when the Lord returns. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I leave you my testimony that the Lord lives and loves us. He wants us to have ears to hear and hearts to understand when He pleads, &quot;Follow thou me&quot;. As we walk the path of discipleship three questions will help us as we ask: &quot;Do I love the Lord with all my heart and soul? Do I love my neighbor? Am I willingly obedient and keeping the commandments?&quot;

<p>
It is another great day at BYU-Idaho, and I am grateful to be with you. &nbsp;For the last few months I have been thinking about you, and I have been thinking about Zion.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today as I talk to you about what we need to do to build Zion together. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Prophet Joseph taught: 
</p>
<p>
	The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; . . . but . . . we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory; . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
	. . . We ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object.<sup><a href="#_edn1" target="_self" target="_self">1</a></sup>&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p>
In the 133<sup>rd</sup> section of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, the Lord has given us two great commandments about the building up of Zion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	Yea, verily . . . the voice of the Lord is unto you:&nbsp; Go ye out of Babylon. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and the voice of the Lord unto all people:&nbsp; Go ye forth unto the land of Zion.<sup><a href="#_edn2" target="_self" target="_self">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
And so, these are the two great commandments:&nbsp; 1) go out from Babylon; and 2) go forth to Zion.&nbsp; These commandments are in force in our day.&nbsp; We are to flee Babylon and gather to the covenant people of the Lord in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; We are to leave the towers and the great and spacious buildings of spiritual Babylon, and we are to come to Zion.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As we think about what we need to do to flee Babylon and come to Zion, it may be helpful to think of Babylon as a great city.&nbsp; In its core, where the neon lights shine bright, there is much wickedness-violence, gross immorality, terrible abuse, and all the values and attitudes that support wickedness on a grand scale.&nbsp; It is the center of debauchery and evil.&nbsp; Outside the core of the city lie the suburbs of Babylon; here there is also sinfulness and wickedness, but they are more subtle.&nbsp; Here we find pornography, drugs, alcohol, love of money and power, and corruption.&nbsp; As we move further, we come to the rolling hills of Babylon.&nbsp; Here, too, there is sin; but it is in the form of selfishness, laziness, contention, entitlement, and pride. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The command to go out from Babylon is a command to leave not only the core of the city, but the suburbs and the rolling hills. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Elder D. Todd Christofferson said this about fleeing Babylon and coming to Zion:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
	To come to Zion, it is not enough for you or me to be somewhat less wicked than others.&nbsp; We are to become not only good but holy men and women.&nbsp; Recalling Elder Neal A. Maxwell&#39;s phrase, let us once and for all establish our residence in Zion and give up the summer cottage in Babylon.<sup><a href="#_edn3" target="_self" target="_self">3</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
You and I face at least two great challenges in fleeing Babylon and establishing Zion. 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If Babylon were a place, we could just leave; but it is not a place.&nbsp; It is a pattern of worldly doctrines, attitudes, and actions that permeate our culture and our society.&nbsp; It is all around us.&nbsp; Babylon is the world and everything of the world.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If we are to flee Babylon, we must recognize and reject its patterns.&nbsp; The gospel of Jesus Christ must penetrate deep into our hearts.&nbsp; Through repentance, obedience, and the power of the Atonement, we must become new creatures in Christ-the covenant, consecrated people of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That will only happen if we get all the way out-out from the center, from the suburbs, and from the rolling hills of Babylon.&nbsp; This means we must recognize what Babylon is and flee it, which brings us to the second challenge. 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Babylon is not just an alternative way of life; Babylon actively fights against Zion.&nbsp; Some of the attacks on Zion are blatant efforts to lure us into the evil center of Babylon or into the suburbs of pornography and drug abuse.&nbsp; But many of the attacks are disguised temptations to adopt the doctrines, attitudes, and behavior of the rolling hills of Babylon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Behavior and attitudes that violate God&#39;s commandments are presented in the doctrines of popular culture with words and images that camouflage their true nature.&nbsp; Attitudes that could lead to wickedness-for example, selfishness and immodesty-are held up as enlightened and advanced, acclaimed in society and popular media.&nbsp; Practices that weaken the family are cloaked in the language of career success, personal pride, and self-realization.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These are the great challenges of Babylon-it is all around us, and its most insidious elements that fight against Zion are hidden and disguised.&nbsp; If you and I are to establish Zion, we must help each other see and flee Babylon and recognize and embrace Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the words of Elder Christofferson: 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
	Zion is Zion because of the character, attributes, and faithfulness of her citizens.&nbsp; Remember, &quot;the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them&quot; (Moses 7:18) . . . . &nbsp;We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen-Zion will come only as they happen.<sup><a href="#_edn4" target="_self" target="_self">4</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
I want to use these three characteristics to frame our discussion of what you and I must do to help each other flee from Babylon, and come to Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
1.&nbsp; <em>Unity:</em><strong>&nbsp; </strong>The people of Zion are of one heart and one mind-unified in Christ.&nbsp; They are one, and they are His.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
2.&nbsp; <em>Pure in heart:</em>&nbsp; The people of Zion are the pure in heart.&nbsp; They dwell in righteousness; the laws of the celestial kingdom prevail in Zion.&nbsp; The people of Zion are a holy people.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
3. <em>No poor among them:</em>&nbsp; There are no poor among the people of Zion, neither in food and clothing, nor in spiritual strength and support.&nbsp; Among the people of Zion, &quot;Every man [seeks] the interest of his neighbor.&quot;<a href="#_edn5" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>5</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At the heart of each of these characteristics are patterns of doctrines, attitudes, and actions that help us build Zion.&nbsp; We can&#39;t build Zion by passively waiting for someone else to build it for us.&nbsp; We build Zion by acting in faith under the direction of the Holy Ghost to understand, internalize, and apply the doctrines of salvation and to recognize and flee from the corresponding attitudes and practices of Babylon that fight against Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let me illustrate what I mean with a few examples connected to each of the three characteristics of Zion.&nbsp; Let&#39;s begin with &quot;Unity.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We are commanded to forgive all men.&nbsp; Forgiveness is essential to establishing Zion.&nbsp; We all sin; we all make mistakes.&nbsp; If we do not forgive one another, we deny the power of the Atonement.&nbsp; Those hurts fester and become resentments and anger.&nbsp; They destroy unity and dissolve the bonds of charity that are essential to Zion.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon people always feel like victims.&nbsp; In their pride the people of Babylon are easily offended.&nbsp; They seek blame, punishment, and vindication for even the slightest inconvenience.&nbsp; There is no forgiveness in Babylon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An attitude of humility is central to a life centered in Christ.&nbsp; The people of Zion are of one heart and mind because they are humbly united in Christ.&nbsp; Each seeks the interest of his neighbor, so there is in Zion an attitude and practice of humble cooperation.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Pride rules in Babylon.&nbsp; The basic attitude is:&nbsp; What is in it for me?&nbsp; Babylon thrives on competition, envy, and comparisons with others.&nbsp; Selfishness and materialism breed self-promotion and contention.&nbsp; In modern Babylon we hear the echo of Korihor:&nbsp; &quot;. . . every man prosper[s] according to his genius, . . . every man conquer[s] according to his strength.&quot;<sup><a href="#_edn6" target="_self" target="_self">6</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s now turn to the patterns that help us to be pure in heart. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Obedience to God is the foundation of Zion.&nbsp; It is the pathway to purity of heart and becoming a holy people.&nbsp; An attitude of obedience is essential to building Zion.&nbsp; In its highest form, obedience comes from feeling Christ&#39;s love, loving Him, acting in faith in Him, and submitting our will to His.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon the countervailing pattern is rebellion:&nbsp; &quot;They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.&quot;<sup><a href="#_edn7" target="_self" target="_self">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The people of Zion are modest-in dress, in behavior, in language.&nbsp; They know and live the doctrine that our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The modest people of Zion avoid sensuality in dress and arrogance and brashness in behavior.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Immodesty in dress, language, and behavior is the way of Babylon.&nbsp; For women this is the world of tight-fitting clothing, short skirts, scoop-neck tops, high-slit skirts, short shorts, and the immoral thoughts and actions that go with them.&nbsp; For men, this is the world of low-slung pants; unbuttoned shirts; undisciplined grooming; arrogant, suggestive language; and immoral behavior. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We have the Light of Christ, and we have moral agency.&nbsp; Each of us is personally accountable and responsible for our actions and our thoughts according to the light and knowledge we have received.&nbsp; Personal responsibility is essential to repentance and, thus, to the building of Zion. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon the attitude is:&nbsp; Rules don&#39;t apply to me; I am special.&nbsp; The culture of Babylon teaches:&nbsp; &quot;My behavior is not my responsibility.&nbsp; It is socio-economic forces or someone else that makes me do what I do.&quot; &nbsp;In Babylon, no matter what you do, it is always someone else&#39;s fault. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I now turn to the third characteristic of Zion, that there are no poor among them. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Zion, each person &quot;esteem[s] his brother as himself&quot;<sup><a href="#_edn8" target="_self" target="_self">8</a></sup> and &quot;seek[s] the interest of his neighbor&quot;<sup><a href="#_edn9" target="_self" target="_self">9</a></sup> even if it means a sacrifice of time, resources, or convenience.&nbsp; Following the example of the Son of God, a willingness to sacrifice so that others may be blessed is a hallmark of Zion.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An attitude of entitlement permeates Babylon.&nbsp; Bred by pride and feelings of &quot;victimhood,&quot; the people of Babylon feel that what they have is theirs by right.&nbsp; Not only do they not have to share what they already have, they have a right to get more of what they want.&nbsp; They are entitled. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Zion, work is essential.&nbsp; It is the way we create things of value and take care of each other.&nbsp; It is ennobling and good.&nbsp; In Zion, &quot;the laborer[s] . . . labor for Zion,&quot;<sup><a href="#_edn10" target="_self" target="_self">10</a></sup> and they work hard. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Babylon, the ideal is something for nothing.&nbsp; Working hard is denigrated.&nbsp; Gambling is celebrated.&nbsp; The people of Babylon look for deals where they can take advantage of someone and get something for nothing. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We build Zion by fleeing from Babylon and embracing the attitudes and practices of Zion.&nbsp; And we do it together.&nbsp; We can help each other develop the patterns of Zion by acting in faith to lift, strengthen, and rescue one another when we face temptations, sin, hardships, and disappointments.&nbsp; I would like to tell you a story about four BYU-Idaho students who helped each other build Zion.&nbsp; These are not real students, but their story is based on real experiences. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brock had been a student at BYU-Idaho for almost three semesters. &nbsp;Although school was not easy for him, he had enjoyed his time on campus and had been a fairly active member of his ward. &nbsp;Brock had struggled in high school with his testimony. &nbsp;He had worked with his bishop to be worthy to be at BYU-Idaho; but he wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to serve a mission, and he had a lot of questions about his future. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Alison, Sara, and Jen were roommates at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; They had been at school for three years. &nbsp;Sara had just returned from a mission to Brazil and had re-joined her old roommates. &nbsp;They were in Brock&#39;s ward and in his family home evening group. &nbsp;All three young women were very active in the ward.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One day, while they were eating dinner, Sara asked her roommates what they thought of Brock. &nbsp;They all agreed that he was friendly and fun to be around, but Jen said something that made them all think:&nbsp; &quot;You know, I think there is something missing in his life. &nbsp;When I talk to him or see him at Church or FHE, he seems a little distant to me.&quot; &nbsp;Sara said, &quot;I think what&#39;s missing is the light of the gospel. &nbsp;On my mission I watched people grow in their testimonies so that the light radiated from them. &nbsp;That is what is missing in Brock.&quot; &nbsp;Alison then asked, &quot;Do you think we should say something to him?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Alison&#39;s question is a classic, perennial question about our responsibility to reach out and help each other. &nbsp;When we see someone who is spiritually wounded or someone who is struggling with the standards of the gospel, what should we do?&nbsp; President Henry B. Eyring answered that question this way:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	You may have been the only one to sense by inspiration the warning cry. The others may feel, as you will be tempted to think, &quot;Maybe the trouble I thought I saw is just my imagination.&nbsp; What right do I have to judge another? &nbsp;It&#39;s not my responsibility.&nbsp; I&#39;ll leave it alone until he asks for help.&quot;&nbsp; . . . Yet you are under covenant to go to a spiritually wounded child of God.&nbsp; You are responsible to be brave enough and bold enough not to turn away.<sup><a href="#_edn11" target="_self" target="_self">11</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If you act in faith in the Savior and go to someone who is struggling or spiritually wounded, you do not go alone. &nbsp;It is the Lord&#39;s work. &nbsp;If you go prayerfully seeking the guidance of the Spirit, He will go before you and He will go with you. &nbsp;He promises you that the power of His atoning sacrifice will strengthen you so that those you seek to help will feel Him and see Him through you. &nbsp;You will help them feel and understand the nurture and the admonition of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>The nurture of the Lord</em> is His warmth, kindness, and strengthening power; His mercy and grace; His divine encouragement, good cheer, confidence, and hope.&nbsp; The nurture of the Lord is the pure love of Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>The admonition of the Lord</em> is the laws and commandments of the Lord, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the doctrines of salvation, and the ordinances and covenants of the temple.&nbsp; The admonition of the Lord is the standard of His glorious gospel. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These two dimensions combine to create a framework I have found helpful in understanding how we help each other. &nbsp;Think of this as a map of your efforts to help your roommates and friends establish the doctrines, attitudes, and practices of Zion in their lives.&nbsp;

With love-low to high-arrayed across the diagram, and setting standards-low to high-arrayed up and down, we get four zones:&nbsp; 1) low love, low standards; 2) high love, low standards; 3) low love, high standards; and 4) high love, high standards.

</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Whether you are a roommate, a friend, a home or visiting teacher, or a family member, if you are trying to help someone establish the patterns of Zion, you need to be in the upper right zone.&nbsp; You need to be in the zone of Zion, the zone of high love and high standards.&nbsp; There are two reasons. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
First, the upper right is the only zone where we are fully living the gospel.&nbsp; It is the only zone where we love one another with the pure love of Christ and teach the standards of the gospel by precept and by example, the way the Savior would teach them. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Second, the upper right zone is the only zone where you can help another person establish the patterns of Zion effectively.&nbsp; Look carefully at the other three zones.&nbsp; In each one an important part of the gospel message is missing. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
High Love-Low Standards:&nbsp; You love and support, but don&#39;t teach doctrine or encourage righteous attitudes or actions.&nbsp; Your message is:&nbsp; The gospel is not important.

</p>

</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
In the zone of Zion the message is:&nbsp; I care.&nbsp; You are important.&nbsp; The gospel is important. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/2009_09_15_Clark/28.jpg" border="0" alt="Quadrant - Zones of Babylon" width="448" height="299" />
</p>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
The zone of Zion is the best place to be, but I know from my own experience and the experience of many, many students that many of us end up in one of the other three zones.&nbsp; We end up in the zones of Babylon.&nbsp; Being in the zone of Zion takes courage and discipline and faith.&nbsp; To be there you must do two things at the same time-you must show great love and support and encouragement; and, at the very same time, you must teach doctrine, set a good example, and encourage righteous attitudes and behavior. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
So, if you want to be in the zone of Zion, what should you do and how should you do it? &nbsp;I have some ideas I will share with you, but my basic message is simple:&nbsp; Just go!&nbsp; Follow the Savior&#39;s teachings in the parables of the Lost Sheep and the Good Samaritan and go. &nbsp;Be aware of those around you.&nbsp; Someone you know may be lonely, or discouraged, or lost. &nbsp;Someone you know may be struggling with the patterns of Zion.&nbsp; A friend, a roommate, a classmate may still be caught up in Babylon.&nbsp; Be aware of those around you, and talk to them.&nbsp; Go into the wilderness after the one that is lost.&nbsp; Walk the Jericho Road and help those who are alone and wounded. &nbsp;Act in a spirit of mildness and meekness with a voice full of kindness and love.&nbsp; Have lunch with your friend who is struggling.&nbsp; Visit and listen.&nbsp; Share your feelings and your concern.&nbsp; Pray together.&nbsp; Share your testimony of the Savior, of His love, and of His healing power.&nbsp; Encourage your friend with the doctrines of salvation and the promised blessings.&nbsp; Extend an invitation to act in faith, to pray, to come back, to come in, to flee Babylon and come to Zion. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Before you go, prepare with prayer listening to the Spirit.&nbsp; Trust the Lord, but don&#39;t wait and don&#39;t turn away.&nbsp; Go in faith that the Lord will go before you, that He will guide you to love and set high standards so that your friend will find strength, forgiveness, and healing power in Christ. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
When you go to someone who is struggling, your purpose is to help that person come unto Christ.&nbsp; You will feel a sense of responsibility, and love, and hope.&nbsp; But your friend must choose.&nbsp; If your friend is defensive and will not listen, you may need to find others to go with you.&nbsp; If that does not work and the matter is serious, you may need to get the bishop involved.&nbsp; As the Savior taught in Matthew 18:&nbsp; 
</p>
<p align="left">
	. . . if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother [or sister].&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p align="left">
	But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p align="left">
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p align="left">
	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church.&quot;<sup><a href="#_edn12" target="_self" target="_self">12</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
Brothers and sisters, when we take the nurture and admonition of the Lord to those who are wounded, who are struggling with sin or discouragement, who are confused and lost, we do a great work.&nbsp; It is not an easy work, but it is right and it is good.&nbsp; It is the Lord&#39;s work.&nbsp; It is the work we covenant to do all of our lives. 
</p>

This is the work that Alison, Sara, and Jen contemplated that day at dinner in their apartment.&nbsp; Let me tell you what happened.&nbsp; The young women decided to talk to Brock.&nbsp; The next Sunday they went up to him after church and asked if they could talk to him.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Sure.&quot;&nbsp; So, they talked.&nbsp; Sara said:&nbsp; &quot;Brock, we think you are a really great guy.&nbsp; But we feel there is something missing in you.&nbsp; We don&#39;t see the light of the gospel in your eyes.&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s the music you listen to, or what you watch, or where you go; but the light is missing.&nbsp; We just wanted to tell you that if you had that, if you had the light of the gospel in your eyes and in your life, you would be awesome.&quot;&nbsp;

That brief conversation with those sisters had a powerful impact on Brock.&nbsp; He thought about what they said for a long time.&nbsp; He prayed about it and decided they were right.&nbsp; He changed the kinds of movies he watched, and he listened to different music.&nbsp; He worked on being more consistent in his study of the scriptures, and his prayers were different.&nbsp; By the end of that semester he made up his mind to serve a mission.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">
Brock prepared well.&nbsp; By the time he went into the MTC, he was on fire.&nbsp; He was a great missionary and had many wonderful experiences.&nbsp; When he returned home Alison, Sara, and Jen had graduated and married.&nbsp; But it wasn&#39;t long before Brock met his eternal companion; they were married about a year after his mission.&nbsp; Today, the light of the gospel is in his life and in his eyes.&nbsp; And the three sisters were right:&nbsp; He is awesome.

This is how we build Zion together.&nbsp; We pray for help and then we reach out to help and strengthen each other, share testimony and doctrine, and invite each other to act in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I know this happens often on this campus.&nbsp; The Lord wants it to happen for each one of you. &nbsp;He wants you to flee Babylon, every bit of it.&nbsp; He wants you to come to Zion, to build Zion here and now. It is in part so that this university will accomplish its divinely appointed mission and destiny. 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
But the Lord&#39;s purposes in your lives extend far beyond this campus.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, I bear witness to you that God our Father lives.&nbsp; His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; This is His Church and kingdom.&nbsp; He is preparing His kingdom and us for His return in power and glory.&nbsp; This is His promise I will make to you:&nbsp; If you are true to your covenants, if you will act in faith to help your roommates and your friends, you will learn how to build Zion together.&nbsp; The spirit of Zion and the patterns of Zion will get into your hearts, and you will build Zion wherever you go.&nbsp; You will do it in your families with your own children.&nbsp; You will reach out to people who are less active, to the lost, the struggling.&nbsp; You will share the gospel and open the gates of salvation to those who are seeking the truth.&nbsp; You will be in the temple often; and Zion will be in your heart, in your home, in your wards and branches.&nbsp; And the blessings of Zion-the blessings of unity, holiness, righteousness, peace, joy, happiness, and power-will flow into your life and into the lives of your family forever. 
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
I leave you with this promise and invoke the blessings of the Lord upon you as we seek to build Zion together.&nbsp; In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

President Clark and I are excited about this new semester at BYU-Idaho, and we are glad to have you with us today.&nbsp; I pray that the Spirit will bless and inspire all of us while we are together here for this hour of devotional. 
</p>

<p>
This is such a beautiful time of year in Rexburg.&nbsp; I have watched out my kitchen window, and it seems the green fields of summer mellowed into golden fields of harvest practically overnight.&nbsp; I am filled with a sense of connection to those beautiful fields.&nbsp; They have nurtured the plants that produce the food we eat every day.&nbsp; It is a lovely miracle.&nbsp; The fertile earth nurtures the plants that nurture us! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I would like to suggest that BYU-Idaho is like those nourishing fields.&nbsp; It is a place where students are nourished and grow and develop.&nbsp; There are many nutrients available to you on campus every day. &nbsp;Today I want to talk about three that are essential: love of God, love of fellowman, and love of self. &nbsp;A good description of these three nutrients is found in Mosiah chapters 4 and 5.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s start in Mosiah, chapter 4, with verse 9: 
</p>
<p>
	Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.<a href="#_end1" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>1</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
King Benjamin teaches us that our relationship with our Heavenly Father grows when we talk to Him, express our love to Him, and thank Him for all that we have.&nbsp; We need to confess, repent, and forsake our sins before Him; ask for His forgiveness; serve Him; and keep His commandments.&nbsp; As we do these things, King Benjamin promises: 
</p>
<p>
	. . . ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God.&quot;<a href="#_end2" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
As we feel His love, we will realize that He cares about us and knows us and our individual needs.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Let&#39;s look together now at verses 13 and 26: 
</p>
<p>
	Ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.<a href="#_end3" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	. . . impart of your substance to the poor . . . feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally.<a href="#_end4" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
King Benjamin exhorts us to love and serve the people around us every day, to look outward beyond our own desires and ambitions to see the needs of others and invite them to grow with us.&nbsp; Our salvation depends on us being our brother&#39;s keeper.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For this last nutrient, please turn to Mosiah, chapter 5, verse 7, and read with me King Benjamin&#39;s description of the covenant people of the Lord: 
</p>
<p>
	And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; . . . for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.<a href="#_end5" target="_self" target="_self"><sup>5</sup> </a>
</p>
<p>
This is a description of you.&nbsp; You are the sons and daughters of the King, and He loves you and He wants you to see yourself and love yourself as He sees you and loves you.&nbsp; If you will turn to Him and keep His commandments, He will bless you with His pure and perfect love. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Savior is the source of all three of these nutrients. &nbsp;Just as the plants in the field cannot grow without the earth, without water, and without the light of the sun, so we cannot thrive and grow spiritually without the Savior. &nbsp;He is the Son of God, the Living Water, the Light and the Life of the World.&nbsp; I know He lives and loves us.&nbsp; And I know that in Him we may feel the love of God, love our fellowman, and see and love ourselves as He sees and loves us. &nbsp;It is my prayer that you may obtain these nutrients in your life in this sacred and set apart place.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. 
</p>

<p align="left">My brothers and sisters, I am honored to be with you today. I have a great love for this institution. I attended Ricks College when I was a young returned-missionary and two of my own children were students here. Our family has been blessed because of those</p>
<p>connections to BYU-Idaho. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will attend my words today&mdash;that you will not only hear with your ears and understand with your heads, but most important, feel deep within your hearts the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a huge sports fan and as a result, I am always attuned to inspiring sports movies and human interest stories about individual athletes and teams who have overcome great odds to become champions. Several years ago one such story grabbed my attention. It is the story of Jim Abbott who was born without the lower part of his left arm and hand. Despite this birth defect, he was not &ldquo;handicapped.&rdquo; He became a star athlete in high school, winning a full-ride scholarship to play baseball for the University of Michigan. His approach to baseball was quite different than most. He batted with one arm. He could not wear a baseball glove on the arm without a hard, so he would hold the glove against his body with his arm and throw the ball with his other arm and hand. In one motion, he would then slip his hand into the glove and be ready to field. He became an All-American baseball pitcher and won the prestigious Sullivan Award&mdash;given to the nation&rsquo;s outstanding amateur athlete&mdash;the first time a baseball player had ever won the award. Drafted by the California Angels, Jim played 10 years in the major leagues. The highlight of his incredible and inspiring story came on September 4<sup>th</sup> 1993 in Yankee Stadium. As a New York Yankee, Jim pitched a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim Abbott&rsquo;s story became particularly personal to me five years ago when our grandson, Gavin, was born with a similar birth defect. Gavin doesn&rsquo;t have the lower part of his left arm and instead of a hand he has what we lovingly refer to as his &ldquo;nub.&rdquo; Since Gavin&rsquo;s birth I have been drawn to stories of remarkable men and women born with birth defects or who lost their arms through accidents or disease yet, who are able to do amazing things. Two in particular stand out. The first is Tony Melendez. Born without any arms, Tony is a gifted musician&mdash;an incredible vocalist and an amazing guitarist--playing the guitar with his feet with as much skill as anyone. Tony&rsquo;s songs reflect his love for the Lord and his recognition that it through God&rsquo;s grace that has been able to accomplish so many things. His CDs have won many awards, he has been named the performer of the year in Branson, MO, and performed for the Pope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is Barb Guerra who lost both her arms when she was two years old in a freak electrical accident. Despite that, she is able to do all the things that we take for granted in our daily lives. She drives a car, puts on her makeup, cares for her children with her legs and feet instead of with arms and hands. Her remarkable abilities and her indomitable spirit have been chronicled on numerous newscasts and network shows. Videos of Barb Guerra&rsquo;s amazing use of her legs and feet are ubiquitous on YouTube. (I guess you could call these videos of her &ldquo;footage&rdquo; [pun intended].) Today she is fitness trainer and has won awards in fitness and bodybuilding competitions. She too recognizes that God has a plan and purpose for her life and that His strength is greater than her own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As inspiring and amazing as these three individuals are to me, I am most inspired by my grandson Gavin. Although his birth defect hasn&rsquo;t slowed him down much and he certainly doesn&rsquo;t consider himself handicapped, he does notice that he is different than others. He is at the age now where he is conscious of the stares and unkind comments about his nub. In decorating her home for Christmas a couple of years ago, our daughter put out the olive wood nativit set she had received from us as a Christmas gift when we lived in Israel several years ago. There were a few chips and dents and pieces broken off here and there. One day, three-year-old Gavin excitedly exclaimed, &ldquo;Mommy, look! Jesus has a nub just like me!&rdquo; Part of one of the carved wooden arms of the baby Jesus in the nativity set had been broken off. It was so small that none of us had even noticed it before. Yet Gavin noticed. He was thrilled that Jesus had a nub too. His mother explained to him that Jesus doesn&rsquo;t really have a nub, but that He understands exactly what it is like for Gavin to have one. In that tender teaching moment, our daughter once again taught him about the resurrection and the perfect love of the Savior and how Christ&rsquo;s Atonement ensures that someday Gavin will have a hand and arm like everyone else. I have thought a lot about that and today I want to share with you some of my thoughts about arms&mdash;our arms and Christ&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, each of us was born with a birth defect&mdash;without arms if you will. That defect is called mortality. We are all, as King Benjamin described us, &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or fallen men and women&mdash;&ldquo;enemies to God.&rdquo; Our mortal arms, no matter how strong, no matter how diligent or productive, can never save us in the Celestial Kingdom of God. It is only through the arms of Christ that we can be saved. His arms not only save us but also strengthen us. That is what we call grace. The LDS Bible Dictionary defines grace as the &ldquo;enabling power of Christ.&rdquo; Elder David A. Bednar taught: &ldquo;The enabling power of the Atonement of Christ strengthens us to do things we could not do on our own.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end1" target="_self">1</a></sup> Our Father in Heaven wants us to recognize that, spiritually speaking, we are like children born without arms&mdash;totally dependent upon the caring arms of another&mdash;the loving arms of Christ. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob taught: &ldquo;The Lord God showeth our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.&rdquo;<a href="#end2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite scriptural accounts that illustrates this important principle is found in Matthew chapter 14. You remember the story. As the disciples watched the Savior walk on the Sea of Galilee toward their boat, they were fearful and thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus assured them it was Him and that they need not be afraid. To which, Peter declared: &ldquo;Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Jesus, Matthew records: &ldquo;And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on water, to go to Jesus.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the story is what I find most significant. It is the part of the story that I personally can relate to. I can&rsquo;t relate to walking on water, but I can relate with what Peter next experienced.</p>
<p>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
<p>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</p>
<p>And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</p>
<p>Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying; Of a truth thou art the Son of God.<sup><a href="#end4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>All of us have had, are having, or will yet have a Peter-like &ldquo;sinking&rdquo; experience in some way and will at some time (probably many times) cry out, &ldquo;Lord, save me.&rdquo; Even Peter&rsquo;s strong fisherman arms were not strong enough to save himself. He needed the rescuing arms of Christ and so do we. Can you imagine Peter&mdash;his head bobbing beneath the surface of the lake, choking from the water that he is swallowing, and with panic-stricken, fearful cries for help&mdash;then saying as the Savior extends his arm: &ldquo;No thank you. I will swim to shore. I sank myself, so I must save myself.&rdquo; Of course not. How ridiculous! Yet, we sometimes do just that. Even though we may know in our heads that our mortal arms and hands are deficient&mdash;in fact, utterly incapable of rescuing or redeeming ourselves&mdash;we sometimes resist, even recoil from, the outstretched arms of the Savior. Sometimes we spiritually drown ourselves because we won&rsquo;t allow His arms to cradle us. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland so eloquently stated:</p>
<p>May I be bold enough to suggest that it is impossible for anyone who really knows God to doubt his willingness to receive us with open arms in a divine embrace if we but come to Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am convinced that none of us appreciate how deeply it wounds the loving heart of the Savior of the world when He finds that His people do not feel confident in His care or secure in His [arms].<sup><a href="#end5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The scriptures contain many references to the arms of the Lord. They describe different ways whereby His arms bless our lives and strengthen our arms. Today I wish to focus on three: His arms of power, His arms of love, and His arms of mercy. These three, though certainly related to each other, are unique in what they do<em> for</em> us and<em> to</em> us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First, Christ&rsquo;s arms of power. Moses declared: &ldquo;The Lord is my strength . . ., and he is become my salvation: he is my God. . . . Thy right hand [or we could replace &ldquo;hand&rdquo; with &ldquo;arm&rdquo;], O Lord, is become glorious in power.&rdquo;<a href="#end6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup> </a>I am convinced that one of the reasons the scriptures are so full of examples and teachings of God&rsquo;s majestic power is to drive the point home to each of us personally that &ldquo;nothing is too hard for the Lord.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end7" target="_self">7</a> </sup>David knew that God was more powerful than Goliath.<sup><a href="#end8" target="_self">8</a></sup> Elijah knew and demonstrated with consuming fire that Jehovah&rsquo;s power is greater than Baal and all his priests.<sup><a href="#end9" target="_self">9 </a></sup>Likewise, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego could testify that fiery furnaces can&rsquo;t hold a candle, literally and symbolically, to the glory and power of the Son of Man.<sup><a href="#end10" target="_self">10</a></sup> His arms of power created &ldquo;worlds without number,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end11" target="_self">11</a></sup> parted the Red Sea, stilled the storms, fed the multitude, healed the sick, and raised the dead. His arms of power are seen in nature, in His compassion to the downtrodden, His forgiveness to the repentant and in His vengeance upon the wicked. All around us&mdash;both temporally and spiritually&mdash;we see the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s words in section 1&mdash;&ldquo;The Preface&rdquo;&mdash;of the Doctrine and Covenants: &ldquo;And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end12" target="_self">12</a></sup>&nbsp; When I understand and more fully accept that, as Nephi declared, &ldquo;he is mightier than all the earth,<sup><a href="#end13" target="_self">13</a> </sup>I can trust more deeply in His arms of power, more fully allow myself to be upheld by those arms, and rely less on the arm of flesh&mdash;even my own puny arms. When we recognize the Lord&rsquo;s arms of power and learn to lean on His &ldquo;ample arm&rdquo; we will trust more fully in His promises to us. His promises of power, protection, succor and strength are too numerous to cite here today. The scriptures are full of them. Let me share just a few of my favorites:</p>
<p>Isaiah 41:10: &ldquo;Fear thou not; for I am with thee; be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand [or for our purposes today, we could say &ldquo;arms&rdquo;] of my righteousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John 14: 18, 27: &ldquo;I will not leave thee comfortless: I will come to you . . . . Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. . . . Let not your heart be troubled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma 36:3: &ldquo;Whosoever shall put their trust in God [and I would add &ldquo;his arms of power&rdquo;] shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D&amp;C 84: 88: &ldquo;I will go before your face. I will be on your hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to scriptural promises and promises given by modern-day prophets and apostles each of us is a beneficiary of <em>personal </em>promises of God&rsquo;s power in our lives. Those promises come to us in the form of priesthood blessings from patriarchs, from fathers and bishops, home teachers and trusted friends. Because of the Lord&rsquo;s arms of power, we can trust in those promises, and know that we are held ever tightly in God&rsquo;s powerful arms, or as Amulek described them, the &ldquo;arms of safety.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end14" target="_self">14</a>&nbsp;</sup>God&rsquo;s promises of power and protection are sure&mdash;&ldquo;take it to the bank&rdquo; &ldquo;rock solid.&rdquo; President George Q. Cannon, who served as a counselor in the First Presidency to Presidents Taylor, Woodruff, and Snow, declared:</p>
<p>No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction, He will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character [to do so]. He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and He will be the same throughout the eternal ages to come. We have found that God. We have made Him our friend, by obeying His gospel; and He will stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we will not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we will only trust in our God and keep His commandments.<sup><a href="#end15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the &ldquo;arms of love.&rdquo; Father Lehi, in his deathbed discourse to his family, testified: &ldquo;the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have beheld his glory, and <em>I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love.</em>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end16" target="_self">16&nbsp;</a></sup> That phrase&mdash;&ldquo;encircled about eternally in the arms of his love&rdquo;&mdash;is perhaps the most profound and yet deeply personal phrase in all of Holy Writ. I came to understand this passage more deeply from personal experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost exactly five years ago, I was a struggling new mission president trying to keep it together even as I felt like I was falling apart at the seams. I was overcome with the problems and pressures of presiding over a mission&mdash;tormented by my own feelings of inadequacy&mdash;overcome by how unprepared and unworthy I felt. I was in desperate need for strength and spirituality beyond my own. As we concluded an area mission presidents&rsquo; seminar, I was at an emotional and spiritual low points. For a few days we had been instructed by the visiting general authorities in all the things we needed to be doing to better train missionaries and to more effectively push the work of the Kingdom forward. It was both inspiring and intimidating&mdash;intimidating because I felt that, by comparison to the other mission presidents, I was not measuring up and I was fearful that I would never be able to measure up. I was afflicted with a bad case of the &ldquo;gotta dos&rdquo; and &ldquo;oughta bes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the seminar we attended a temple session in the Winter Quarters Temple. As we completed the endowment session and passed through the veil into the celestial room, Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, greeted each mission president with a warm embrace and the words, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that President Uchtdorf even remembers doing this, but I will never forget it. It may not have been a big deal to him or the others, but it was a monumentally transforming moment for me. I felt the love of the Savior emanating from this special witness into my soul. It was as if I was being embraced by the Lord himself&mdash;I was truly &ldquo;encircled&rdquo; in the arms of the Master&rsquo;s love. That hug and his words &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; and &ldquo;You are doing a great job&rdquo; strengthened and inspired and motivated me more than all the teaching and training done in the meetings. The Savior&rsquo;s perfect and infinite &ldquo;arms of love&rdquo; give us the strength to endure heartaches and hardship, the power to resist temptation, and the courage to keep the commandments even as we are being mocked and scorned by those in the great and spacious building. From his own personal experiences, Paul clearly understood the strengthening power of the Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;arms of love.&rdquo; He testified:</p>
<p>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . .</p>
<p>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<sup><a href="#end17" target="_self">17</a></sup></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the &ldquo;arms of mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma reminded his people and us today as well that Christ &ldquo;sendeth an invitation unto all men for the <em>arms of mercy</em> are extended towards them.&rdquo;<a href="#end18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup> </a>Think of what that invitation really means. Think of what His arms of mercy can do for you. When you are embraced in His arms of mercy you will come to know the peace and joy of being clean&mdash;forgiven of your sins through His atoning mercy. You will see the world and all eternity with new eyes through the companionship of the Holy Ghost. You will feel more profoundly and love more deeply, because He will, as the prophet Ezekiel declared, &ldquo;take away the stony heart out of your flesh&rdquo; and give you a &ldquo;new heart and a new spirit&rdquo; that will &ldquo;cause you to walk in [His] statutes . . . and do them.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end19" target="_self">19</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had an experience that helped me glimpse what it means to be &ldquo;clasped in the arms of Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;embraced in the arms of His mercy. I told you of my experience with Elder Uchtdorf in the Winter Quarters Temple. I was so personally moved and powerfully motivated by that experience, I determined to follow Elder Uchtdorf&rsquo;s example and share that feeling with my missionaries. We took every group of departing missionaries, on their last day in the mission, to the Nauvoo Temple for an endowment session. As Elder Uchtdorf had done with me, I greeted each missionary as they came into the celestial room with a big hug and the words, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; I expressed my deep appreciation for their service and that they were now able to &ldquo;return with honor.&rdquo; I meant every word of it, but I must admit that it was easier to express those sentiments to some missionaries than others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One elder in particular had given me more than his share of grief. In fact, most of the grays hairs I gained in the mission field came because of him. He seemed to be in trouble all of the time. On more than one occasion, I told him I was going to send him home. He would always promise me that he would try harder&mdash;which he did&mdash;for awhile&mdash;and the cycle would start all over again&mdash;disobedience, admonishment and correction, repentance, renewed determination, then slacking off (sounds like all of us, doesn&rsquo;t it?). I just wanted him to be able to complete his mission honorably. He wasn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;all star&rdquo; missionary, but he made it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he came through the veil of the temple into the celestial room, I greeted him with the customary hug and the almost obligatory &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Tears streamed down his face. His whole body shook with weeping. When he could speak, he whispered to me over and over again, &ldquo;Thank you for extending me mercy.&rdquo; It was a tender moment and I, too, shed many tears. My love for him at that moment was unbounded. Then it happened. I understood. Almost as if the veil parted, I sensed a coming day when I would embrace the Savior and with tears of gratitude and love likewise declare, &ldquo;Thank you for extending me mercy.&rdquo; How grateful I am for the Lord&rsquo;s arms of mercy. I am grateful that He has rescued me, not only from physical death and from sins, but also from myself&mdash;my fears, my discouragement, my doubts, my feelings of inadequacy. Truly, his arms of mercy are arms of safety and security. Mormon reminds us that, had his people repented and faithfully followed the Savior, &ldquo;they might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end20" target="_self">20</a> </sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My young friends (and all you others that are not so young), you are incredible people&mdash;incredible in your accomplishments, your talents, your desires for righteousness, and for who you were even before you came to this earth. Yet, despite all of this, remember you and I are weak&mdash;spiritually without arms. We understand and at times feel profoundly what Ammon declared: &ldquo;Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore, I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end21" target="_self">21</a></sup> Ammon knew whose arms gave him the strength to perform mighty miracles and proclaim the gospel with the trump of an angel. Paraphrasing Ammon&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Clasped in the arms of Jesus, I can do all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we exercise greater faith in the arms of the Lord&mdash;His arms of power, His arms of love, and His arms of mercy. May we allow Him to cradle and carry and comfort us in those arms. In turn, our arms&mdash;our determination and our devotion&mdash;will be strengthened. I bear testimony of the living reality of Jesus Christ and the truthfulness of His gospel. I am witness of the enabling power of the Lord&rsquo;s grace that empowers us to do and to be better than we are. I have experienced that power. I have felt His arms around me. May you be &ldquo;clasped in the arms of Jesus&rdquo; I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, President, and especially thank you to the choir for I think a perfect presentation to at least the feelings and hopefully the remarks I will make to you today. I&rsquo;d like to start, brothers and sisters, with introducing you to one of my grandsons&mdash;this is my grandson, Isaac. Isaac prefers to be known as Indie Jones. He is five years old; he started kindergarten this year. He announced to his mother a couple of days ago, he said, &ldquo;Mom, I know what&rsquo;s going to happen to me when I die. I&rsquo;m going to go live with Heavenly Father, and I&rsquo;m going to be with Him forever.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mom, I&rsquo;ll write home every day.&rdquo; Now Isaac&rsquo;s pretty strong on the doctrine, but I think he needs a little help on the application. And, in a sense, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to be talking to you today about. My brothers and sisters, it&rsquo;s a privilege to be here with you and speak with you today. It&rsquo;s a special privilege to be at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1997 when I was first hired and getting acquainted with my new job, I had a remarkable spiritual experience: Because my wife, Sharon, was back in Utah getting things ready for the move to Rexburg, I would work late learning my new responsibilities. One evening about 10:30 p.m., I left the office to return to my apartment. It was late September and an unusually warm fall evening. I stopped to enjoy its beauty. As I stood there and reflected on all the miraculous events that had led me to Ricks College, an overwhelming spiritual feeling overcame me. In that moment of solitude, I heard a voice in my mind say, &ldquo;You get to work at my school.&rdquo; The feelings of gratitude and appreciation I felt that night were so powerful. I have never forgotten the privilege it is to be here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some months later I was serving on a committee that dealt with the admission of students that did not meet all of the university&rsquo;s admission requirements. These students had unique circumstances or hardships in their lives that required some special considerations to determine if they should be admitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember the file of one young sister who had a very difficult family situation. As the facts were discussed by the committee, I had another profound spiritual experience. The still small voice whispered, &ldquo;This young lady needs to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I pondered these events and others since, it has become clear to me that no one is here by accident. I have been in positions to see new hires and learn their stories, and I have visited with many of you students. It is such a faith-building experience that leaves you with a deep testimony. We have all been brought here for a purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I became better acquainted with Ricks College and especially with the people, I would say to myself, &ldquo;This is not just a college in the Church Educational System; this is the Lord&rsquo;s Officer Training Center.&rdquo; Of course, in 2004, Elder David A. Bednar would clarify and expand my limited metaphor when he taught us that BYU-Idaho is a Disciple Preparation Center&mdash;a place where outstanding young people qualify to come to be taught and influenced by others and become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a href="#end1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="endref1" target="_self"></a> I often reflect on that night outside the Hart Building: &ldquo;You get to be at my school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have grown up being told you are a special generation, held back for the last days, Saturday&rsquo;s Warriors, to help prepare the world for the Lord&rsquo;s Second Coming. I have often wondered why you are considered better than my generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think a powerful insight into your generation was given by Elder Neal A. Maxwell when he said, &ldquo;The youth of this generation have a greater capacity for obedience than any other previous generation.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#end2" target="_self">2</a><a name="endref2" target="_self"></a></sup> I think that statement is so insightful. I hope you fully understand not only your capacity of obedience but how important obedience is in developing and preparing you for your future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you would please turn to the scripture that was read, in Doctrine and Covenants Section 29, verse 8, I would like to suggest that you keep your scriptures open as I present some of my thoughts today. I will come back to focus on Section 29 many times. The Lord says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that <em>they&nbsp;shall be gathered in unto one place</em> upon the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth.<a href="#end3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="endref3" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although these scriptures refer to gathering to all centers of strength, I will use it to give insight to one of those centers&mdash;A Disciple Preparation Center, BYU-Idaho. We have all been gathered here for a very important purpose. It is that purpose and why we are gathered that I wish to discuss with you today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will look at Section 29, verse 7, it reads: &ldquo;And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.&rdquo;<a href="#end4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="endref4" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone who comes to BYU-Idaho comes in different stages of spiritual, academic, and personal development. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to see that there is something different about this place. When I first arrived, two things stood out to me: first, the goodness of the people, and second, how much simpler things were here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was young the prophet was David O. McKay, and I remember a profound statement he made: &ldquo;The Gospel of Jesus Christ makes bad men good and good men better.&rdquo;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Disciple Preparation Center is not established to make bad men good. It is designed to make good men and good women better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BYU-Idaho is not a spiritual hospital; it is not designed to accept the spiritually sick. It is designed for those who are qualified, prepared, and are spiritually healthy to move forward quickly and intensely on the path of discipleship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are those who have misunderstood and have come here unworthily, or while they have been here, have committed transgressions. Then because of the pressures of the world, they feel they can repent and get their lives in order here while they continue their disciple development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repentance puts lives in order so that individuals can again qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is essential for spiritual development and confidence to move forward on this sacred path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of our systems in the university are designed to protect these important standards. When a student is dismissed, most of us have been conditioned to feel that the student is being punished, but it is really just the opposite. Certain issues of repentance can be better accomplished away from campus. However, in all we do as students, faculty, mentors, and friends, we must always use the example of the Savior to act in love, mutual respect, and shared responsibility. In making judgments of circumstances where others are involved, we must always consider first, saving souls; second, protecting others; and third. protecting the integrity of the Church and BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have taught these principles in our Student Living program, there was a young woman who took them to heart. She became aware of her good friend and roommate&rsquo;s problem of a serious sin. They confided, talked, and cried together. Finally, she counseled her roommate to go to the bishop. Reluctantly, the roommate went and confessed. The bishop, as a common judge, held a disciplinary council, and this wonderful sister was disfellowshipped and had to withdraw from school. The young woman that encouraged her to go to her bishop felt guilty. She said, &ldquo;I encouraged her to go the bishop, but I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things are hard, but for this good sister to qualify for her full measure of the Atonement, she needed to go through this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she has corrected her life, we hope she will want to return and fulfill her destiny. We will open our arms to her as an institution. She will be clean and better prepared, more confident to move along the path of discipleship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will refer back to Doctrine and Covenants Section 29, verse 7: &ldquo;for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This scripture refers to our attitudes, even our attitudes about the standards of this university. This university is part of the Lord&rsquo;s Kingdom. All of the university standards&mdash;for admission, student honor, and housing&mdash;have been approved by his prophets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe there are any of you who are contrary to all of these things. However, I see some of you have trouble with parts of the standards. It might be curfew, not shaving daily, fashionable clothing that is tight fitting or revealing. For some, the university standards have had unintended results. Some of you are becoming more casual on Sunday. Your attitude seems to be, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wear these clothes on campus because of the strict standards, so I&rsquo;ll wear them to church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you feel the term &ldquo;hard heart&rdquo; is a very strong term for this behavior, but some put these things in the category of, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not that big of a deal.&rdquo; The scriptures talk about being double minded, double hearted, or having a divided heart. To be obedient to only parts of standards of discipleship is dangerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I remind you of the example of Nephi and his brothers Laman and Lemuel in the Book of Mormon. Laman and Lemuel were always at Home Evening. The fundamental difference between Laman and Lemuel and Nephi is that Laman and Lemuel always found parts of the commandments that irritated them or didn&rsquo;t agree with their personal preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen closely to the account in the third chapter of 1 Nephi where Lehi explains to Nephi that the Lord commanded him to send his sons back to Jerusalem to secure the records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In verse 5, Lehi says:<em> </em>&ldquo;And now, behold thy brothers <em>murmur</em>, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.&rdquo;<a href="#end5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="endref5" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then two verses later, Nephi responds,</p>
<p>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for&nbsp;Iknow that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.<a href="#end6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="endref6" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;While these two verses serve as a stark contrast of opposing principles, the lesson is sandwiched in between these two verses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1 Nephi, Chapter 3, verse 6: &ldquo;Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be <em>favored</em> of the Lord, because thou hast <em>not murmured</em>.&rdquo;<a href="#end7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="endref7" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bednar taught that murmuring is spiritual cowardliness. When you love the Honor Code, not just tolerate it, you will begin to develop power on the path of discipleship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after Elder Bednar was called and sustained as an Apostle, he returned to BYU-Idaho and continued serving as our president for a short while. During one of our Monday meetings, he mentioned that he needed a place to go to church. I was serving as the bishop of a married student ward at the time, so I invited him to come to our ward. Think of it, the newest member of the Quorum of the Twelve at the BYU-Idaho 51<sup>st</sup> Ward. During his remarks he taught a very powerful and insightful principle:</p>
<p>The world into which you students are going is degenerating so fast that what was required in the past will not be sufficient in the future to provide the necessary spiritual protection. The rapidity with which we respond to prophetic counsel will be an important source of protection.<a href="#end8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="endref8" target="_self"></a></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Elder Neal A. Maxwell referred to this principle as &ldquo;spiritual reflex.&rdquo; When our nature is to immediately respond to spiritual direction, promptings, or commands, there is spiritual protection available that may not be available if we have to take time to debate or evaluate our commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are being prepared to go into a world of tribulation and desolation stated in verse 8 of Doctrine &amp; Covenants 29. This is a world of affliction, suffering, misery, lack of moral direction, persecution, fear, and danger. Our ability not only to make the right decisions but the speed in which we make them is a powerful principle of spiritual survival in today&rsquo;s moral decline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to Doctrine and Covenants Section 29, verse 8: We are gathered &ldquo;to prepare [our] hearts and be prepared in all things.&rdquo;<a href="#end9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="endref9" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we prepare our hearts for discipleship? I look at your greatest capacity&mdash; obedience. You have demonstrated that quality, even as far back as the pre-existence and are now in an environment where that capacity will be developed and fine tuned. President James E. Faust taught that the price of discipleship is obedience.<a href="#end10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="endref10" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bednar described obedience as a process or progression. &ldquo;Obedience does not occur quickly or all at once. Nor is it merely a matter of great personal discipline; it is a change of disposition, a change of heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;He continues, &ldquo;Closely associated with obeying with a willing heart is reaching a point where we no longer are driven or directed by rules; instead, we learn to govern our lives by principle.&rdquo;<a href="#end11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a><a name="endref11" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you turn to Doctrine and Covenants 59:4: &ldquo;And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with commandments not a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, what do we receive for being obedient? Blessings which are new and more demanding commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have our agency to obey or not, but it is clear that the Lord gives us commandments in a fashion that helps us grow, develop, progress, and become better disciples. This is how it works in God&rsquo;s kingdom, and it is the pattern at His university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie has taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obedience is the first law of heaven, the cornerstone upon which all righteousness and <em>progression</em> rest. It consists in <em>compliance</em> with divine law, in <em>conformity</em> to the mind and will of Deity, in complete <em>subjection</em> to God and His commands. To obey gospel law is to yield obedience to the Lord, to execute the commands of and be ruled by Him whose we are.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a><a name="endref12" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;I believe there are two significant dimensions that are essential for spiritual development: the level of our obedience and the level of standards or commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pattern of complying to commandments and gospel standards allows us to develop spiritual characteristics that change our nature. This change of nature results in a desire to conform to the mind and will of God. As this desire is fully developed, we subject our will to His will. The scriptures refer to this progression as a change of heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I know some of you are separating university standards from commandments and laws of Deity. Initially there appears to be some justification for that argument. May I share an observation? Many of the university standards we dilute or ignore are in fact very important in our progress as disciple learners. They are foundational for our preparation, progression, and protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you all know, obedience is closely connected with the law of sacrifice. Obedience alone can be just a change in behavior. As commendable as that may be, obedience without sacrifice does not produce the spiritual development required by the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. Man&rsquo;s love of God is measured in terms of obedience. Sacrifice is God&rsquo;s gift to allow us to truly see ourselves as He sees us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago on our refrigerator I noticed one of those things with the little doily around it that my wife brought home from Relief Society. It said, &ldquo;Sacrifice is giving up something good for something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are still commanded to sacrifice, but not by shedding blood of animals. Our highest sense of sacrifice is achieved as we make ourselves more sacred or holy. This we do by our obedience to the commandments of God. Thus, the laws of obedience and sacrifice are indelibly intertwined&hellip;. As we comply with these and other commandments, something wonderful happens to us&hellip;. We become more sacred and holy&mdash;like our Lord!<sup><a href="#end13" target="_self">13</a><a name="endref13" target="_self"></a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe, in a sense, those few students and employees who struggle with the standards of the university may have to sacrifice more to be in compliance. At the same time, maybe they are blessed to have more to give and will experience more personal growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of sports I learned a valuable principle that applies to life and to the gospel. When a team is struggling, when things are not going right, the really good coaches will go back to the basics, the fundamentals. When a team has an interruption in their competitive cycle, such as a bye in their schedule or a period before a bowl game, the championship teams return and focus on the basic skills of their sport. The lesson for me spiritually is when my life is not where it should be, I have learned to focus on obedience to small and simple things. Just like coaches, if the <em>foundational skills</em> are strong, then the other issues seem to take care of themselves. If you can&rsquo;t dribble well, it doesn&rsquo;t do much good to put in a new motion offense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now returning to Doctrine and Covenants Section 29, verse 8. While preparing their hearts is at the core, you are to be prepared in all things. As a university we have the responsibility to prepare you with skills and knowledge to be successful in your professions, family, and community. In addition, a Disciple Preparation Center develops skills in leadership, analytical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communications, team work, and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are also developing a personal character of integrity, work ethic, positive attitude, service to others, personal health and well-being, and cultural awareness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And maybe most importantly you are developing the principle of learning to learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the principles of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learners and teachers exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as a principle of action.</p>
<p>Learners and teachers understand that true teaching is done by and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Learners and teachers lay hold of the word of God.</p>
<p>Learners and teachers act for themselves and accept responsibility for learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Learners and teachers love, serve, and teach one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These principles could also be used to describe disciple leaders and disciple development. It is the culture at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of a group of students who prepare themselves to go to class. They go prepared not only to be taught but to teach. They prepare and present themselves spiritually to qualify for a full measure of the only true teacher, the Holy Ghost. Can you imagine the power and spirit that would reside in the classroom when everyone comes prepared?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for contrast, can you see what would happen if one young man in this class didn&rsquo;t read the assignment, got up late, didn&rsquo;t shave, threw on some jeans and a tee shirt, and came into class five minutes late? What would be the impact on the learning environment by the action of this one individual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to Doctrine &amp; Covenants 29:6: &ldquo;Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith, being united in prayer according to my command, ye shall receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Learning Model is demanding. Everyone has to give more for it to work. Even with our best efforts we will never succeed until we call upon heaven for additional strength and capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you love the Lord, you will love and serve others. If you truly love others you will pray for them. At a Disciple Preparation Center we should be united&mdash;and especially united in prayer. Then as the Lord promises in this scripture, you shall receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At BYU-Idaho, teachers should pray for their students, students should pray for their teachers, students should pray for each other, and we should open class and other events with a united prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we learn how to truly love, serve, and teach others, we develop capacities of discipleship. The following statement by President Henry B. Eyring helps us understand this principle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make you a prophecy. I will simply tell you: The day will come that that capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you&rsquo;re in. They will not quite know why, but you will know that the reasons you are being singled out is not because of your innate gifts as a leader <em>but because you have done what the Savior&nbsp; would do&mdash; &hellip; reach out to those around you to lift them, to help&nbsp; them to be better, even when it might be a little difficult&nbsp; and you might not have been received very well.</em><a href="#end14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a><a name="endref14" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>As we have discussed, you have been gathered here to change your hearts and to be prepared in all things to become a disciple leader in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf described this preparation this way.</p>
<p>Discipleship is a journey. We need the refining lessons of the journey&nbsp;to craft our character and purify our hearts. By patiently walking in&nbsp;the path of discipleship, we demonstrate to ourselves the measure&nbsp;of our faith and our willingness to accept God&rsquo;s will rather than ours.<a href="#end14" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a><a name="endref15" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;There will be a time when we will all be required to leave BYU-Idaho. Under the direction of the Spirit, we will be guided to the four corners of the earth to consecrate our time and talents. The talents we have developed here will be key in building God&rsquo;s kingdom and assisting in establishing Zion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be going into a world of turbulence and tribulation, a world that will challenge and even attack the fundamentals of our faith. God is preparing you in a very special way to stand against the powers of evil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson described this challenge in these words:</p>
<p>We need strong Christians who can persevere against hardship, who can sustain hope through tragedy, who can lift others by their example and their compassion, and who can consistently overcome temptations. We need strong Christians who can make important things happen by their faith and who can defend the truth of Jesus Christ against moral relativism and militant atheism.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a><a name="endref16" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Finally, in closing, let&rsquo;s return to Doctrine and Covenants Section 29, verse 5: &ldquo;Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We should all have glad hearts. Jesus Christ knows us, and he knows His work. He has gathered us here for a special and sacred purpose. What happens here is important to Him. <em>So much so He is in our midst, He is among us.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that each of you will see yourselves as your Heavenly Father sees you&mdash;His elect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that because of your special capacity of obedience to small and simple things you will develop and flourish at this special, sacred, and set apart place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are being prepared to be trusted, consecrated disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. You will be instruments in His hands to build His kingdom and establish Zion in preparation for His Second Coming. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My dear young friends, I am pleased to speak to this BYU-Idaho audience. I am conscious that I am also speaking to many in other places. In this time of the Internet, what we say in one place is instantly put before a wider audience, including many to whom we do not intend to speak. That complicates my task, so I ask your understanding as I speak to a very diverse audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In choosing my subject I have relied on an old military maxim that when there is a battle underway, persons who desire to join the fray should &ldquo;march to the sound of the guns.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref1" href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>So it is that I invite you to march with me as I speak about religious freedom under the United States Constitution. There is a battle over the meaning of that freedom. The contest is of eternal importance, and it is your generation that must understand the issues and make the efforts to prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An 1833 revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith declared that the Lord established the United States Constitution by wise men whom he raised up for that very purpose (Doctrine and Covenants 101:80). The Lord also declared that this constitution &ldquo;should be maintained for the rights and protection <em>of all flesh&rdquo;</em> (Doctrine and Covenants 101:77; emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1833, when almost all people in the world were still ruled by kings or tyrants, few could see how the infant United States Constitution could be divinely designed &ldquo;for the rights and protection of all flesh.&rdquo; Today, 176 years after that revelation, almost every nation in the world has adopted a written constitution, and the United States Constitution profoundly influenced all of them. Truly, this nation&rsquo;s most important export is its constitution, whose great principles stand as a model &ldquo;for the rights and protection of all flesh.&rdquo; On the vital human right of religious freedom, however, many constitutions fall short of the protections that are needed, so we are grateful that the United States government seeks to encourage religious freedom all over the world.<a name="_ednref2" href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of basic human rights in other countries, I refer to some recent history in Mongolia, which shows that the religious freedom we have taken for granted in the United States must be won by dangerous sacrifice in some other nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the perestroika movement in the Soviet Union, popular demonstrations in Mongolia forced the Communist government to resign in March 1990. Other political parties were legalized, but the first Mongolian elections gave the Communists a majority in the new parliament, and the old repressive attitudes persisted in all government departments. The full functioning of a democratic process and the full enjoyment of the people&rsquo;s needed freedoms do not occur without a struggle. In Mongolia, the freedoms of speech, press and religion &mdash; a principal feature of the inspired United States Constitution &mdash; remained unfulfilled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that precarious environment, a 42-year-old married woman, Oyun Altangerel, a department head in the state library, courageously took some actions that would prove historic. Acting against official pressure, she organized a &ldquo;Democratic Association Branch Council.&rdquo; This 12-member group, the first of its kind, spoke out for democracy and proposed that state employees have the freedoms of worship, belief and expression, including the right to belong to a political party of their choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Oyun and others were fired from their state employment, Oyun began a hunger strike in the state library. Within three hours she was joined by 20 others, mostly women, and their hunger strike, which continued for five days, became a public demonstration that took their grievances to the people of Mongolia. This demonstration, backed by major democratic movement leaders, encouraged other government employees to organize similar democratic councils. These dangerous actions expanded into a national anti-government movement that voiced powerful support for the basic human freedoms of speech, press and religion. Eventually the government accepted the demands, and in the adoption of a democratic constitution two years later Mongolia took a major step toward a free society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Latter-day Saints, this birth of constitutional freedom in Mongolia has special interest. Less than two years after the historic hunger strike, we sent our first missionaries to Mongolia. In 1992 these couples began their meetings in the state library, where Oyun was working. The following year, she showed her courage again by being baptized into this newly arrived Christian church. Her only child, a 22-year-old son, was baptized two years later. Today, the Mongolian members of our Church number 9,000, reportedly the largest group of Christians in the country. A few months ago we organized our first stake in Mongolia. Called as the stake president was Sister Oyun&rsquo;s son, Odgerel. He had studied for a year at BYU-Hawaii, and his wife, Ariuna, a former missionary in Utah, graduated there.<a name="_ednref3" href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great fundamentals of our inspired constitution, relied on by Oyun of Mongolia and countless others struggling for freedom in many countries in the world, is the principle that the people are the source of government power. This principle of popular sovereignty was first written and applied on the American continent over 200 years ago. A group of colonies won independence from a king, and their representatives had the unique opportunity of establishing a new government. They did this by creating the first written constitution that has survived to govern a modern nation. The United States Constitution declared the source of government power, delegated that power to a government, and regulated its exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with many other religious people, we affirm that God is the ultimate source of power and that, under Him, it is the people&rsquo;s inherent right to decide their form of government. Sovereign power is not inherent in a state or nation just because its leaders have the power that comes from force of arms. And sovereign power does not come from the divine right of a king, who grants his subjects such power as he pleases or is forced to concede, as in Magna Carta. As the preamble to our constitution states: &ldquo;We the People of the United States . . . do ordain and establish this Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This principle of sovereignty in the people explains the meaning of God&rsquo;s revelation that He established the Constitution of the United States &ldquo;that every man may act . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 101:78). In other words, the most desirable condition for the effective exercise of God-given moral agency is a condition of maximum freedom and responsibility &mdash; the opposite of slavery or political oppression. With freedom we can be accountable for our own actions and cannot blame our conditions on our bondage to another. This is the condition the Lord praised in the Book of Mormon, where the people &mdash; not a king &mdash; established the laws and were governed by them (see Mosiah 29:23&ndash;26). This popular sovereignty necessarily implies popular <em>responsibility</em>. Instead of blaming their troubles on a king or tyrant, all citizens are responsible to share the burdens of governing, &ldquo;that every man might bear his part&rdquo; (Mosiah 29:34).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the rights and protection of all flesh&rdquo; the United State Constitution includes in its First Amendment the guarantees of free exercise of religion and free speech and press. Without these great fundamentals of the Constitution, America could not have served as the host nation for the restoration of the gospel, which began just three decades after the Bill of Rights was ratified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The First Amendment reads: &ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&rdquo; The prohibition against &ldquo;an establishment of religion&rdquo; was intended to separate churches and government, to prevent a national church of the kind still found in Europe. In the interest of time I will say no more about the establishment of religion, but only concentrate on the direction that the United States shall have no law &ldquo;prohibiting the free exercise&rdquo; of religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guarantee of the free exercise of religion, which I will call religious freedom, is the first expression in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. As noted by many, this &ldquo;pre-eminent place&rdquo; identifies freedom of religion as &ldquo;a cornerstone of American democracy.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref4" href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a> The American colonies were originally settled by people who, for the most part, had come to this continent to be able to practice their religious faith without persecution, and their successors deliberately placed religious freedom first in the nation&rsquo;s Bill of Rights. So it is that our national law formally declares: &ldquo;The right to freedom of religion undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref5" href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The free &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; of religion obviously involves both the right to choose religious beliefs and affiliations and the right to &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; or practice those beliefs. But in a nation with citizens of many different religious beliefs, the right of some to act upon their religious principles must be qualified by the government&rsquo;s responsibility to protect the health and safety of all. Otherwise, for example, the government could not protect its citizens&rsquo; person or property from neighbors whose intentions include taking human life or stealing in circumstances rationalized on the basis of their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inherent conflict between the precious religious freedom of the people and the legitimate regulatory responsibilities of the government is the central issue of religious freedom. Here are just a few examples of current controversial public issues that involve this conflict: laws governing marriage and adoption; laws regulating the activities of church-related organizations like BYU-Idaho in furtherance of their religious missions &mdash; activities such as who they will serve or employ; and laws prohibiting discrimination in employment or work conditions against persons with unpopular religious beliefs or practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems are not simple, and over the years the United States Supreme Court, which has the ultimate responsibility of interpreting the meaning of the lofty and general provisions of the Constitution, has struggled to identify principles that can guide its decisions when government action is claimed to violate someone&rsquo;s free exercise of religion. As would be expected, most of the battles over the extent of religious freedom have involved government efforts to impose upon the practices of small groups like Mormons. Not surprisingly, government officials sometimes seem more tolerant toward the religious practices of large groups of voters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unpopular minority religions are especially dependent upon a constitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion. We are fortunate to have such a guarantee in the United States, but many nations do not. The importance of that guarantee in the United States should make us ever diligent to defend it. And it is in need of being defended. During my lifetime I have seen a significant deterioration in the respect accorded to religion in our public life, and I believe that the vitality of religious freedom is in danger of being weakened accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Religious <em>belief</em> is obviously protected against government action. The <em>practice</em> of that belief must have some limits, as I suggested earlier. But unless the guarantee of free exercise of religion gives a religious actor greater protection against government prohibitions than are already guaranteed to all actors by other provisions of the constitution (like freedom of speech), what is the special value of <em>religious</em> freedom? Surely the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of <em>religion</em> was intended to grant more freedom to religious action than to other kinds of action. Treating actions based on religious belief the same as actions based on other systems of belief should not be enough to satisfy the special place of religion in the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Religious freedom has always been at risk. It was repression of religious belief and practice that drove the Pilgrim fathers and other dissenters to the shores of this continent. Even today, leaders in all too many nations use state power to repress religious believers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greatest infringements of religious freedom occur when the exercise of religion collides with other powerful forces in society. Among the most threatening collisions in the United States today are (1) the rising strength of those who seek to silence religious voices in public debates, and (2) perceived conflicts between religious freedom and the popular appeal of newly alleged civil rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I address this audience of young adults, I invite your careful attention to what I say on these subjects, because I am describing conditions you will face and challenges you must confront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A writer for <em>The</em> <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> predicts that the coming century will be &ldquo;very secular and religiously antagonistic,&rdquo; with intolerance of Christianity &ldquo;ris[ing] to levels many of us have not believed possible in our lifetimes.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref6" href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a> Other wise observers have noted the ever-growing, relentless attack on the Christian religion by forces who reject the existence or authority of God.<a name="_ednref7" href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a> The extent and nature of religious devotion in this nation is changing. The tide of public opinion in favor of religion is receding, and this probably portends public pressures for laws that will impinge on religious freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atheism has always been hostile to religion, such as in its arguments that freedom <em>of</em> or <em>for</em> religion should include freedom <em>from</em> religion. Atheism&rsquo;s threat rises as its proponents grow in numbers and aggressiveness. &ldquo;By some counts,&rdquo; a recent article in <em>The</em> <em>Economist</em> declares, &ldquo;there are at least 500 [million] declared non-believers in the world &mdash; enough to make atheism the fourth-biggest religion.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref8" href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a> And atheism&rsquo;s spokesmen <em>are</em> aggressive, as recent publications show.<a name="_ednref9" href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a> As noted by John A. Howard of the Howard Center for Family, Religion, and Society, these voices &ldquo;have developed great skills in demonizing those who disagree with them, turning their opponents into objects of fear, hatred and scorn.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref10" href="#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such forces &mdash; atheists and others &mdash; would intimidate persons with religious-based points of view from influencing or making the laws of their state or nation. Noted author and legal commentator Hugh Hewitt described the current circumstance this way:</p>
<p>There is a growing anti-religious bigotry in the United States. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For three decades people of faith have watched a systematic and very effective effort waged in the courts and the media to drive them from the public square and to delegitimize their participation in politics as somehow threatening.<a name="_ednref11" href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, a prominent gay-rights spokesman gave this explanation for his objection to our Church&rsquo;s position on California&rsquo;s Proposition 8:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not intending it to harm the religion. I think they do wonderful things. Nicest people. . . . My single goal is to get them out of the same-sex marriage business and back to helping hurricane victims.<a name="_ednref12" href="#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious fact that this objection would deny free speech as well as religious freedom to members of our Church and its coalition partners, there are other reasons why the public square must be open to religious ideas and religious persons. As Richard John Neuhaus said many years ago, &ldquo;In a democracy that is free and robust, an opinion is no more disqualified for being &lsquo;religious&rsquo; than for being atheistic, or psychoanalytic, or Marxist, or just plain dumb.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref13" href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A second threat to religious freedom is from those who perceive it to be in conflict with the newly alleged &ldquo;civil right&rdquo; of same-gender couples to enjoy the privileges of marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have endured a wave of media-reported charges that the Mormons are trying to &ldquo;deny&rdquo; people or &ldquo;strip&rdquo; people of their &ldquo;rights.&rdquo; After a significant majority of California voters (seven million &mdash; over 52 percent) approved Proposition 8&rsquo;s limiting marriage to a man and a woman, some opponents characterized the vote as denying people their civil rights. In fact, the Proposition 8 battle was not about civil rights, but about what equal rights demand and what religious rights protect. At no time did anyone question or jeopardize the civil right of Proposition 8 opponents to vote or speak their views.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real issue in the Proposition 8 debate &mdash; an issue that will not go away in years to come and for whose resolution it is critical that we protect everyone&rsquo;s freedom of speech and the equally important freedom to stand for religious beliefs &mdash; is whether the opponents of Proposition 8 should be allowed to change the vital institution of marriage itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marriage union of a man and a woman has been the teaching of the Judeo-Christian scriptures and the core legal definition and practice of marriage in Western culture for thousands of years. Those who seek to change the foundation of marriage should not be allowed to pretend that those who defend the ancient order are trampling on civil rights. The supporters of Proposition 8 were exercising their constitutional right to defend the institution of marriage &mdash; an institution of transcendent importance that they, along with countless others of many persuasions, feel conscientiously obliged to protect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Religious freedom needs defending against the claims of newly asserted human rights. The so-called &ldquo;Yogyakarta Principles,&rdquo; published by an international human rights group, call for governments to assure that all persons have the right to practice their religious beliefs regardless of sexual orientation or identity.<a name="_ednref14" href="#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a> This apparently proposes that governments require church practices and their doctrines to ignore gender differences. Any such effort to have governments invade religion to override religious doctrines or practices should be resisted by all believers. At the same time, all who conduct such resistance should frame their advocacy and their personal relations so that they are never seen as being doctrinaire opponents of the very real civil rights (such as free speech) of their adversaries or any other disadvantaged group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, in conclusion, I offer five points of counsel on how Latter-day Saints should conduct themselves to enhance religious freedom in this period of turmoil and challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>First</em>, we must speak with love, always showing patience, understanding and compassion toward our adversaries. We are under command to love our neighbor (Luke 10:27), to forgive all men (Doctrine and Covenants 64:10), to do good to them who despitefully use us (Matthew 5:44) and to conduct our teaching in mildness and meekness (Doctrine and Covenants 38:41).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as we seek to speak with love, we must not be surprised when our positions are ridiculed and we are persecuted and reviled. As the Savior said, &ldquo;so persecuted they the prophets which were before you&rdquo; (Matthew 5:12). And modern revelation commands us not to revile against revilers (Doctrine and Covenants 19:30).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, we must not be deterred or coerced into silence by the kinds of intimidation I have described. We must insist on our constitutional right and duty to exercise our religion, to vote our consciences on public issues and to participate in elections and debates in the public square and the halls of justice. These are the rights of all citizens and they are also the rights of religious leaders. While our church rarely speaks on public issues, it does so by exception on what the First Presidency defines as significant moral issues, which could surely include laws affecting the fundamental legal/cultural/moral environment of our communities and nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must also insist on this companion condition of democratic government: when churches and their members or any other group act or speak out on public issues, win or lose, they have a right to expect freedom from retaliation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with many others, we were disappointed with what we experienced in the aftermath of California&rsquo;s adoption of Proposition 8, including vandalism of church facilities and harassment of church members by firings and boycotts of member businesses and by retaliation against donors. Mormons were the targets of most of this, but it also hit other churches in the pro-8 coalition and other persons who could be identified as supporters. Fortunately, some recognized such retaliation for what it was. A full-page ad in the <em>New York Times</em> branded this &ldquo;violence and intimidation&rdquo; against religious organizations and individual believers &ldquo;simply because they supported Proposition 8 [as] an outrage that must stop.&rdquo; <a name="_ednref15" href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a> The fact that this ad was signed by some leaders who had no history of friendship for our faith only added to its force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to note that while this aggressive intimidation in connection with the Proposition 8 election was primarily directed at religious persons and symbols, it was not anti-religious as such. These incidents were expressions of outrage against those who disagreed with the gay-rights position and had prevailed in a public contest. As such, these incidents of &ldquo;violence and intimidation&rdquo; are not so much anti-religious as anti-democratic. In their effect they are like the well-known and widely condemned voter-intimidation of blacks in the South that produced corrective federal civil-rights legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, we must insist on our freedom to preach the doctrines of our faith. Why do I make this obvious point? Religious people who share our moral convictions feel some intimidation. Fortunately, our leaders do not refrain from stating and explaining our position that homosexual behavior is sinful. Last summer Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke these words to a BYU audience:</p>
<p>We follow Jesus Christ by living the law of chastity. God gave this commandment, and He has never revoked or changed it. This law is clear and simple. No one is to engage in sexual relationships outside the bounds the Lord has set. This applies to homosexual behavior of any kind and to heterosexual relationships outside marriage. It is a sin to violate the law of chastity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We follow Jesus Christ by adhering to God&rsquo;s law of marriage, which is marriage between one man and one woman. This commandment has been in place from the very beginning.<a name="_ednref16" href="#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>We will continue to teach what our Heavenly Father has commanded us to teach, and trust that the precious free exercise of religion remains strong enough to guarantee our right to exercise this most basic freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, as advocates of the obvious truth that persons with religious positions or motivations have the right to express their religious views in public, we must nevertheless be wise in our political participation. Preachers have been prime movers in the civil rights movement from the earliest advocates of abolition, but even the civil rights of religionists must be exercised legally and wisely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints, we should never be reticent to declare and act upon the sure foundations of our faith. The call of conscience &mdash; whether religious or otherwise &mdash; requires no secular justification. At the same time, religious persons will often be most persuasive in political discourse by framing arguments and positions in ways that are respectful of those who do not share their religious beliefs and that contribute to the reasoned discussion and compromise that is essential in a pluralistic society.<a name="_ednref17" href="#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em> and finally, Latter-day Saints must be careful never to support or act upon the idea that a person must subscribe to some particular set of religious beliefs in order to qualify for a public office. The framers of our constitution included a provision that &ldquo;no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States&rdquo; (Article VI). That constitutional principle forbids a religious test as a <em>legal</em> requirement, but it of course leaves citizens free to cast their votes on the basis of any preference they choose. But wise religious leaders and members will never advocate religious tests for public office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fragile freedoms are best preserved when not employed beyond their intended purpose. If a candidate is seen to be rejected at the ballot box primarily because of religious belief or affiliation, the precious free exercise of religion is weakened at its foundation, especially when this reason for rejection has been advocated by other religionists. Such advocacy suggests that if religionists prevail in electing their preferred candidate this will lead to the use of government power in support of their religious beliefs and practices. The religion of a candidate should not be an issue in a political campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It was the Christian principles of human worth and dignity that made possible the formation of the United States Constitution over 200 years ago, and only those principles in the hearts of a majority of our diverse population can sustain that constitution today. Our constitution&rsquo;s revolutionary concepts of sovereignty in the people and significant guarantees of personal rights were, as John A. Howard has written,</p>
<p>generated by a people for whom Christianity had been for a century and a half the compelling feature of their lives. It was Jesus who first stated that all men are created equal [and] that every person . . . is valued and loved by God.<a name="_ednref18" href="#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Professor Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza reminds us:</p>
<p>The attempt to ground respect for equality on a purely secular basis ignores the vital contribution by Christianity to its spread. It is folly to believe that it could survive without the continuing aid of religious belief.<a name="_ednref19" href="#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Religious values and political realities are so interlinked in the origin and perpetuation of this nation that we cannot lose the influence of Christianity in the public square without seriously jeopardizing our freedoms. I maintain that this is a political fact, well qualified for argument in the public square by religious people whose freedom to believe and act must always be protected by what is properly called our &ldquo;First Freedom,&rdquo; the free exercise of religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear Brothers and Sisters, I testify to the truth of these principles I have expressed today. I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior, who is the author and finisher of our faith and whose revelations to a prophet of God in these modern times affirmed the foundation of the United States constitution, which as we have said, was given by God to His children for the rights and protection of all flesh. May God bless us to understand it, to sustain it, and to spread its influence throughout the world, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I am humbled by this assignment and feel a great responsibility as I speak with you.&nbsp; I invite your prayers&nbsp; that we may experience an outpouring of the Spirit; that thoughts and feelings will come into your mind and into your heart by the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 8:2).&nbsp; Such impressions, specifically tailored to you, will be more important than anything I might share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, having been baptized in my early 30s.&nbsp; But, when I was about five years old I had an experience that became a &ldquo;defining moment&rdquo;.&nbsp; I was outside with my mother.&nbsp; While she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, I was in the backyard swing, singing a song I&rsquo;d learned in Sunday School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&nbsp; Little ones to Him belong, we are weak, but He is strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not fully recognize all that was happening to me, but I literally felt His love. I began pumping and singing &ndash; harder and harder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, the Bible tells me so&rdquo; (Words By: Anna B. Warner; Music By: Wm. B. Bradbury).&nbsp; I was so filled with His love for me, I felt I could do anything &ndash; even go all the way over the top of the swing if I pumped hard enough!&nbsp; That didn&rsquo;t happen, but what did happen was much more significant:&nbsp; I felt Christ&rsquo;s love and I knew He knew me.&nbsp; I hope you have felt the reality of His love and especially that you might experience it today and have it confirmed again and again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While now Elder David A. Bednar, was serving as president here at Brigham Young University-Idaho he gave an address in which he said, &ldquo;I suspect [we] are much more familiar with the nature of the redeeming power of the atonement than we are with the enabling power of the atonement.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He suggested that most of us understand that Christ came to earth to die for us, to pay the price for our sins and to make us clean; to redeem us from our fallen state and to enable every person to be resurrected from the dead. In other words, we know the Atonement is for sinners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, Elder Bednar added, &ldquo;I frankly do not think many of us &lsquo;get it&rsquo; concerning this enabling and strengthening power of the atonement, and I wonder if we mistakenly believe we must make the journey from good to better and become a saint all by ourselves, through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline, and with our obviously limited capacities&rdquo; (David A. Bednar, &ldquo;<em>In the Strength of the Lord</em>&rdquo;, BYU-Idaho Devotional, Jan. 8, 2002).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the first to admit my guilt in believing that through &ldquo;sheer grit, willpower, and discipline&rdquo; I always think can manage just about anything.&nbsp; Preparing this talk is an example.&nbsp; I searched the scriptures, scanned articles and books, followed links on the Church Web site, and labored over an outline.&nbsp; I felt a tremendous burden as I struggled along working with &ldquo;sheer grit&rdquo;. I think this is not an uncommon feeling. &nbsp;&nbsp;We have a tendency to believe that we have to do everything all by ourselves.&nbsp; I know that nothing is further from the truth for I have repeatedly experienced the enabling power promised by the Savior, but I so easily forget and am so slow to remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the deadline approached I experienced increased stress and stress drives away the Spirit.&nbsp; I came to a point where I knew I could not do this alone; I desperately needed His help.&nbsp; I prayed for guidance, understanding, wisdom, and the enabling power of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why is this so difficult?&rdquo;&nbsp; I prayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With force and power these words came streaming into my mind: Because Satan does not want you to teach of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He knows that when we understand the enabling power of the Atonement, we will be changed; we will have strength beyond our natural abilities, our weakness will be turned to strength, and we will know that &ldquo;in the strength of the Lord [we] canst do all things&rdquo; (Alma 20:4).&nbsp; Christ will heal our feelings of fear, distrust, anger, self-doubt, sorrow, discouragement, and inadequacy.&nbsp; He will help us get through difficult days and trying times &hellip; if we but come unto Him, in faith, humility, and with repentance hearts.&nbsp; But if Satan can prevent us from learning the doctrine of and drawing upon the enabling power of Christ&rsquo;s atonement, he will leave us crippled, weak, and ineffective &ndash; basically, &ldquo;miserable like unto himself&rdquo; (2 Nephi 2:27).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My prideful thinking had led me to believe that I could prepare this talk without His help. However, as I sought forgiveness, a feeling of peace flooded over me, I felt great relief, and scriptures and thoughts came into my mind.&nbsp; I began to write, knowing I was being &ldquo;enabled&rdquo; by Christ&rsquo;s promised grace.&nbsp; I determined I would do everything within my power, relying upon the enabling power of Christ to foil Satan&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect many of you deal with things much more difficult than preparing a talk.&nbsp; In sharing my experience, I in no way want to minimize Christ&rsquo;s power to enable, empower, and strengthen us to deal with much harder things &ndash; things such as depression, friends who betray us, sickness, death of loved ones, and tragic accidents.&nbsp; Others might deal with a variety of addictions: substance abuse, bulimia, anorexia, pornography, or having suffered from abuse of a variety of kinds &ndash; emotional, physical, spiritual, and sexual. &nbsp;To quote Carlfred Broderick, LDS family therapist and author, &ldquo;The gospel of Jesus Christ is not insurance against pain. It is a resource in event of pain, and when that pain comes (and it will come because we came here on earth to have pain among other things), when it comes, rejoice that you have a resource to deal with your pain&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Uses of Adversity.&rdquo; <em>As Women of Faith</em>, 1988 Brigham Young University Women&rsquo;s Conference, Deseret Book, 1989.&nbsp; 172-73).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have come to know many incredible men and women who have struggled under very difficult circumstances and who have each prevailed by coming to rely on Christ, who has enabled them to carry on when burdens seemed too heavy and pain too intense to bear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A dear friend lovingly cared for her brilliant husband who experienced early onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.&nbsp; He also suffered physical illnesses.&nbsp; She was widowed at 55.&nbsp; She told me, &ldquo;There are times when the sadness is overwhelming.&nbsp; I get on my knees and plead, &lsquo;You have to carry this for a while.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do this alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I feel His strength - strength enough to allow me to move forward and face each day, one at a time.&nbsp; To me, this is the power of the Atonement.&nbsp; I know He will not change my situation; the only thing I can change is me &ndash; I have to humble myself and depend on Him for help.&nbsp; Through this experience, I am coming to know the Savior as a person &ndash; not just someone I read about in the scriptures - but someone with whom I am developing a comforting relationship.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Personal interview with author, Feb. 27, 2006).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime ago, I became acquainted with a woman in an institute class I was teaching.&nbsp; Frequently she would stop by my office after class.&nbsp; Over a period of many months, she shared bits of her life story.&nbsp; It was not pretty.&nbsp; As a child she had been ritually and sexually abused.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had spent years in therapy, at times institutionalized because she could not cope.&nbsp; I remember the day she came to my office pleading for help.&nbsp; I could see her pain, but I have no training in how to handle such things and I pled with the Lord to know how I might help.&nbsp; I played Church hymns and after a time, when she had finally calmed down, I invited her to sit in my office chair. On the wall, at eye level, was a large painting of Christ.&nbsp; I invited her to look into His eyes as I began reading to her from the scriptures:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear not, little flock; &hellip; Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 6: 34, 36).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. &hellip;For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?&nbsp; ... Behold, I<strong><em> </em></strong>have graven thee upon the palms of my hands&rdquo; (1 Nephi 21:13-15).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam (2 Nephi 9:21).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause... O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love&rdquo; (Jacob 3:1-2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I read to her, I knew without question I had been blessed by the mercy of Jesus Christ to do and say things beyond my natural ability. For my friend, it was a new beginning.&nbsp; Years later she wrote of that day, &ldquo;I felt an overwhelming feeling of love and peace. Intellectually, I knew about the Atonement, but that day I came to a &lsquo;heart knowledge&rsquo; as I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">felt</span> His healing power.&nbsp; Over time I came to know that ultimately true healing can only come from the Master Physician, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; (Personal correspondence to author, March 28, 2006).&nbsp; The healing which she experienced that day was only a beginning.&nbsp; Challenges still remain, but she is learning to trust in His promises as she turns to the scriptures and seeks His help through prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I became acquainted with a young mother with two active boys under the age of three.&nbsp; Her husband is in college and works two jobs.&nbsp; Both hold responsible callings in the ward.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ever remember seeing her without a smile on her face and a warm greeting for everyone.&nbsp; You can imagine my surprise when I learned that she suffers from the painful and debilitating disease of rheumatoid arthritis.&nbsp; How do you manage I asked her?&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to learn to submit to His will, especially when every joint aches and I only have energy enough to lie on the couch and watch my boys play.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But you never miss church and are always so pleasant,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was not prepared for the simplicity of her answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;We try to do what we are asked &ndash; to hold Family Home Evening, read the scriptures everyday, and pray.&nbsp; I am so grateful for prayer.&nbsp; Several months ago I wanted so badly to have a party for my son&rsquo;s first birthday.&nbsp; I prayed to Heavenly Father, &lsquo;You know how to help me.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t for me; it&rsquo;s for my son.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I finished that prayer, I knew I would be sustained&rdquo; (Personal interview with author, Feb. 27, 2006).&nbsp; This young mother understood the enabling power of the atonement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No doubt some of you deal with different, but equally concerning things specific to you.&nbsp; Things like, fear for the future; worry about getting or keeping a job in this difficult economy; feelings of insecurity or inadequacy. Perhaps you experienced a recent broken engagement and wonder if you will ever get over how you are feeling.&nbsp; Maybe you haven&rsquo;t had a date since coming here to BYU-Idaho and you wonder if you ever will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of you find yourselves standing alone in righteousness.&nbsp; You maintain the standards and live gospel covenants but friends or family mock you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear friends, I don&rsquo;t have all the answers, but this much I do know:&nbsp; Christ is mindful of you, He knows you, He knows of your challenges and circumstances.&nbsp; Look to Him, pray to the Father through Him, tell Him how it is with you.&nbsp; Ask with an honest and believing heart for His help, His promised strength and power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of so many I know who have not yet come to believe all that Christ promises.&nbsp; My heart goes out to them, and I share with them Christ&rsquo;s assurance and invitation: &ldquo;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you &hellip;Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid&rdquo; (John 14:27).&nbsp; Of this invitation, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland made this thought provoking statement, &ldquo;I submit to you, that may be one of the Savior&rsquo;s commandments that is, even in the hearts of otherwise faithful Latter-day Saints, almost universally disobeyed; and I yet I wonder whether our resistance to this invitation could be anymore grievous to the Lord&rsquo;s merciful heart&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come unto Me,&rdquo; <em>Ensign</em>, April, 1998, 19).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added, &ldquo;In [this] same spirit I am convinced that none of us can appreciate how deeply it wounds the loving heart of the Savior of the world when he finds that his people do not feel confident in his care or secure in his hands&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come unto Me,&rdquo; <em>Ensign</em>, April, 1998, 19).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we fully understand how sincere the Savior is when He offers to help us?&nbsp; He stands ever ready to have us come unto him that he might strengthen us and embrace us in the arms of his love.&nbsp; The scriptures bear record of this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has promised, &ldquo;I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; (2 Kings 20:5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the people at Zarahemla, Alma declared, &ldquo;Behold, [Christ] sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you&rdquo; (Alma 5:33).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord invites us all to &ldquo;Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love<strong>&rdquo;</strong> (Doctrine and Covenants 6:20).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 9<sup>th</sup> chapter of 3 Nephi, Christ says, &ldquo;Behold mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me&rdquo; (3 Nephi 9:14).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will you, for a moment, see yourself standing before Christ&rsquo;s outstretched arms as He waits for you to &ldquo;come unto Him&rdquo; and be encircled in the arms of His love?&nbsp; It is here you will be healed, nourished, loved, enabled, strengthened, and made whole.&nbsp; My dear young friends, we need to learn to let the Savior carry our burdens and go to Him regularly to seek His &ldquo;enabling power.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the faithful, Christ has declared, &ldquo;I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs &hellip; that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fulfillment of that wonderful promise, &ldquo;the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord&rdquo; (Mosiah 24:14-15).</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Please ponder the words of two hymns, each written as if Christ himself were speaking to us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lean on my ample arm,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou depressed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will bid the storm</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cease in thy breast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whate&rsquo;er thy lot may be</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On life&rsquo;s complaining sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou wilt come to me,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt have rest.&nbsp; (<em>Hymns</em> no. 120)</p>
<p>In another familiar hymn, Christ also speaks to us, saying:</p>
<p>Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,<br />For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.<br />I&rsquo;ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,<br />Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,<br />My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply.<br />The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design<br />Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.&nbsp; (<em>Hymns,</em> no. 85; versus # 3&amp; 5)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you notice the phrase, &ldquo;my grace all sufficient, shall be thy supply?&nbsp; The Bible Dictionary teaches that &ldquo;the main idea of the word [grace] is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, made possible by his atoning sacrifice, that mankind will be raised in immortality, every person receiving his body from the grave in a condition of everlasting life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please consider these next sentences:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means.&nbsp; This grace is an enabling power&hellip;&rdquo; (LDS Bible Dictionary, 697).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are heady thoughts, but true doctrine - doctrine, which if understood, will not only bless our daily lives but help us withstand the challenges and pressures of our time.&nbsp; But how do we begin to allow the Atonement to work in our lives?&nbsp; What do we need to do?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is simpler than most of us think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we feel troubled, unsure, afraid, or discouraged, we need to remember all He has promised to do for us.&nbsp; We are responsible to repent of any wrong doing and to obey his commandments.&nbsp; Partaking of the sacrament brings us strength beyond our own.&nbsp; Prayer, fasting, study of the scriptures, and temple worship also bring us close to Him where we can feel His love and know of His promises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of all we need to recognize our need for His grace &ndash; both for our ultimate salvation but also for His enabling power every day of our lives.&nbsp; Through His grace, each of us can be uplifted and strengthened (see Proverbs 3:34; 1 Peter 5:5; D&amp;C 88:78; 106:7-8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this statement from the church publication, <em>True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference</em>, &ldquo;If you ever become discouraged or feel too weak to continue living the gospel, remember the strength you can receive through the enabling power of grace&rdquo; (<em>True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference</em>, 78 ).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the very knowledge Satan does NOT want you to know, understand, or apply in your life! &nbsp;&nbsp;His goal is to make you miserable just like he is!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To each of you, I bear testimony that Christ stands ever ready to respond to our feelings of grief, despair, inadequacy, discouragement, pain, and temptation.&nbsp; He constantly offers us His comfort, peace, hope, love, and strength.&nbsp; I know this from personal experience.&nbsp; There are times when I feel a direct answer from the Lord.&nbsp; At other times I sense He allows me to wrestle for a time so that I might learn and grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, Jesus loves us! This we know, for the scriptures tell us so.&nbsp; All of us to him belong, we are weak, but He is strong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that we might realize the truth of Christ&rsquo;s promise to each of us and that we will come to learn and apply the essential doctrine of Christ&rsquo;s enabling power in our lives.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, I am reminded today of the first lecture I delivered when I was teaching gross anatomy to first year medical students many years ago.&nbsp; The medical students met in a large lecture hall that held around 180.&nbsp; The room was steeply sloped and in front there was a moderate sized stage upon which the lecturer stood.&nbsp; Back in those days, we didn&rsquo;t have the fancy electronic teaching tools we have today.&nbsp; All images were projected from a carousel projector from the back of the room.&nbsp; In order to control the projector, the lecturer had a remote control.&nbsp; Keep in mind this was nearly 20 years ago.&nbsp; There were no such things as wireless devices.&nbsp; This remote had a long wire that connected it to the back of the podium. &nbsp;In order to be heard, the lecturer had a microphone clipped to his lapel which also had a long cable connecting it to the back wall. The laser pointers of the day were these large cylinders approximately 10 inches long and over an inch in diameter.&nbsp; They were enormous compared to what we have today.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that the power cord for the laser pointer connected to a small nuclear reactor or particle accelerator or something, because when you turned it on, the lights in the auditorium dimmed visibly and the device began to emit an ominous hum.&nbsp; It was like some kind of first generation laser weapon prototype that had been decommissioned for use in the classroom.&nbsp; As if I wasn&rsquo;t already nervous enough facing 150 type A personality medical students, all of whom were poised on the edges of their seats ready to pounce on me at the first sign of weakness, now I had this train of cords running down my torso and around my feet.&nbsp; If I took so much as a step I would certainly get tangled in them, then in an act of total personal humiliation, I would topple from the stage into the first row of students who would very happily truss me up and carry me to the cadaver lab! The nights preceding the lecture were sleepless and the day of my lecture arrived I felt drained and haggard.&nbsp; This experience feels kind of like that . . . only worse!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this begs the question &ldquo; If this is such a terrifying experience, why on earth would you agree to do it? Believe me, I have asked myself that very question. Well, for three reasons. &nbsp;First, I love you.&nbsp; Second, I love this place, and third as a faculty member at BYU-Idaho, I am fundamentally committed to the process of learning and teaching as it relates to our spiritual and temporal lives.&nbsp; Refusing an invitation to do just that runs contrary to everything that I believe you and I are about at this place.&nbsp; So having said that, I am willing to give it the &ldquo;Old College Try&rdquo; as they say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to be accompanied by my wife.&nbsp; Her positive attitude and congenial outlook on life buoy me up and her support is so critical to me in my life.I am also pleased to have my parents here today.&nbsp; Much of what I hope to present, today was first learned from their teachings and examples in their home&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to begin today by sharing a poem. My father spent his professional life as an educator.&nbsp; He used to recite poetry to us as children.&nbsp; This is one of my favorites and it has stuck with me since I was very young.&nbsp; It is pertinent to what I want to talk about today.&nbsp; The language of the poem is a little &ldquo;country&rdquo; so some words may not be that familiar to you.&nbsp; When you hear the word &ldquo;fodder&rdquo;, that refers to feed, particularly for livestock. The word &ldquo;shock&rdquo; refers to a bundle or a sheave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poem is by James Whitcomb Riley and is entitled, &ldquo;When the Frost is on the Punkin&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHEN the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock,</p>
<p>And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin' turkey-cock,</p>
<p>And the clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the hens,</p>
<p>And the rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;</p>
<p>O, it's then the time a feller is a-feelin' at his best,</p>
<p>With the risin' sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest,</p>
<p>As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock,</p>
<p>When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;They's something kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere</p>
<p>When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is here&mdash;</p>
<p>Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossoms on the trees,</p>
<p>And the mumble of the hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the bees;</p>
<p>But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze</p>
<p>Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days</p>
<p>Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock&mdash;</p>
<p>When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,</p>
<p>And the raspin' of the tangled leaves as golden as the morn;</p>
<p>The stubble in the furries&mdash;kindo' lonesome-like, but still</p>
<p>A-preachin' sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill;</p>
<p>The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;</p>
<p>The hosses in theyr stalls below&mdash;the clover overhead!&mdash;</p>
<p>O, it sets my hart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock,</p>
<p>When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps</p>
<p>Is poured around the cellar-floor in red and yaller heaps;</p>
<p>And your cider-makin's over, and your wimmern-folks is through</p>
<p>With theyr mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and sausage too!...</p>
<p>I don't know how to tell it&mdash;but ef such a thing could be</p>
<p>As the angels wantin' boardin', and they'd call around on me&mdash;</p>
<p>I'd want to 'commodate 'em&mdash;all the whole-indurin' flock&mdash;</p>
<p>When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the imagery of this poem.&nbsp; I love the description of the Fall and of the especially the feeling of satisfaction and wealth that is described by the references to harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up on a small dairy farm.&nbsp; We milked a small herd of cows and we grew most of our own crops.&nbsp; My parents kept a large and well-tended garden and a small orchard adjacent to our home.&nbsp; So I am very familiar with the concept of harvest and it brings sweet memories to me.&nbsp; My mother adhered to the adage of gardening, &ldquo;You eat what you can and what you can&rsquo;t, you can!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the late summer we began canning and freezing.&nbsp; We made freezer corn, we canned green beans and pickles. We bottled peaches and pears and other fruits.&nbsp; Later in the fall we picked apples and made them into apple sauce, pie filling, apple juice and apple cider.&nbsp; Tomatoes were canned and stored as salsa, juice or other sauces. Finally, our potatoes were dug up and bagged for the winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these activities, my parents stored a number of other food items.&nbsp; Of course the hard red wheat had its place in our basement storage room along with other staples such as flour and sugar.&nbsp; In a small shed adjacent to our home were extra freezers filled with frozen meats, jams and other items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to visualize this with me.&nbsp; At the bottom of an old set of concrete steps in my parent&rsquo;s home is their basement storage room.&nbsp; When you open the doors you are met with a rich earthy smell. Turning on the light reveals a relatively small space packed with shelves and at the end of canning season, these shelves are filled with jars and cans and boxes and tubs of the items I just described to you.&nbsp; If you were to walk into the outside shed you would see bags of potatoes on the floor, boxes filled with apples, tomatoes, fall squash and freezers filled with meat.&nbsp; Can you get a sense of the satisfaction, safety, self reliance and wealth this type of resource represents?.&nbsp; It makes me hungry just thinking about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was our family food storage and it was used wisely.&nbsp; Once in place we didn&rsquo;t just sit back and wait for a famine to strike before we began to use it.&nbsp; Items from these shelves adorned virtually every meal.&nbsp; My mother would pull from these stores items for side dishes, main dishes, garnishes and desserts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I watched her practice her considerable home economy skills as she used this resource to bless the life of our family and many others.&nbsp; On many occasions we would be about to sit down to dinner when company would arrive.&nbsp; They would be invited to join us.&nbsp; With a few quick trips to the basement, a meal that was intended for 6 would easily feed twice that. It was literally like witnessing the miracle of the loaves and the fishes first hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On more than a few occasions when Amber and I were newly married and our children were young.&nbsp; Our budget was stretched thin.&nbsp; As we left my parents home following a visit, we were almost always presented with a box or several boxes of food items from storage.&nbsp; My parents just seemed to know what we needed.&nbsp; We loved going home!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I have played a bit of a mean trick on you today.&nbsp; We have brought you here shortly after lunch, turned off the lights, and talked to you about food storage.&nbsp; This is like a perfect recipe for a nap.&nbsp; If I were to now sprinkle in a few sentences about family history, I&rsquo;m certain that I could have you all dozing quite soundly.&nbsp; I am the first to admit that I possess a formidable power. My current and former students will tell you that my lecturing style is like the verbal equivalent of chloroform.&nbsp; A few well placed syllables from me and virtually no one is immune to the sleepiness they induce.&nbsp; If you wonder who my students are, they are the ones who showed up with pillows!&nbsp; I recognize that it is more power than one man should bear, but in my own defense, I do try use it for good and not evil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this, I need you to rouse yourself for the next part of my talk, because while it may not be rivetingly interesting, it is important.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;ve been speaking about so far is an extension of the Law of the Harvest.&nbsp; In my mind, implicit within the concept of harvest is the concept of storage.&nbsp; When we reap in abundance, we store the excess.&nbsp; This appears to be a natural law.&nbsp; When a plant produces more sugars than it can use immediately, it stores them.&nbsp; When you and I consume more nutrients than we can use immediately, our body stores those nutrients for a time of need. I have already talked with you about my experiences with growing and storing foods for our home storage.&nbsp; In the first devotional of this semester, Sister Clark spoke about spiritual nutrients and it began to stir an idea within me and I have been pondering it since.&nbsp; Can this template of reaping in abundance and storing the excess be applied to spiritual nutrients? Is there such a thing as a spiritual food storage?&nbsp; If so, what would it be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I brought with me today a few items that I consider as part of my spiritual food storage. The first is an old book of remembrance that my parents compiled for me.&nbsp; It contains a genealogy of my fathers as well as a history of some of my ancestors in their own words. It is also a record of God&rsquo;s dealings in their life as well as in mine.&nbsp; In it, I have copies of my baptismal certificate, my ordination records, my patriarchal blessing, my mission call, and our wedding certificate.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s almost like my very own set of Brass Plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love to pull this off the shelf and flip through the pages.&nbsp; I enjoy reading the experiences of my ancestors and the trials and blessings they experienced.&nbsp; When I see my baptismal certificates or certificates of ordinations, I reflect on the covenants that I have made with my heavenly father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another item that I have is one of several journals that I have kept in my life.&nbsp; This particular one is from my mission years.&nbsp; In it I have recorded my mission activities and the families my companions and I taught.&nbsp; It records episodes when my testimony grew and some of the challenges I faced.&nbsp; When I read these journals, I am prompted to remember how the Lord supported our efforts, how he opened doors for us and how he led us to families and strengthened our testimonies.&nbsp; It is an important part of my spiritual food storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Journals are a great way to add to add to our spiritual stores.In the October 2007, General Conference, President Henry B. Eyring spoke on Remembering. &nbsp;He related the following story:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our children were very small, I started to write down a few things about what happened every day. Let me tell you how that got started. I came home late from a Church assignment. It was after dark. My father-in-law, who lived near us, surprised me as I walked toward the front door of my house. He was carrying a load of pipes over his shoulder, walking very fast and dressed in his work clothes. I knew that he had been building a system to pump water from a stream below us up to our property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He smiled, spoke softly, and then rushed past me into the darkness to go on with his work. I took a few steps toward the house, thinking of what he was doing for us, and just as I got to the door, I heard in my mind&mdash;not in my own voice&mdash;these words: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giving you these experiences for yourself. Write them down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went inside. I didn&rsquo;t go to bed. Although I was tired, I took out some paper and began to write. And as I did, I understood the message I had heard in my mind. I was supposed to record for my children to read, someday in the future, how I had seen the hand of God blessing our family. Grandpa didn&rsquo;t have to do what he was doing for us. He could have had someone else do it or not have done it at all. But he was serving us, his family, in the way covenant disciples of Jesus Christ always do. I knew that was true. And so I wrote it down, so that my children could have the memory someday when they would need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: &ldquo;Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?&rdquo; As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, spiritual food storage includes any items that cause us to reflect, recall and remember the lord and his blessings in our lives.&nbsp; For example, I consider my family and friends as a type of food storage.&nbsp; I have been blessed with a wonderful family and with tremendous friends.&nbsp; Many of whom are here. &nbsp;I rarely look at my children without considering with deep gratitude that the Lord would bless my life with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work with a great group of people in my department.&nbsp; They are more than colleagues, they are treasured friends.&nbsp; Recently several of us were together sitting shoulder to shoulder and I began to reflect that over the past decade or so, I had sat with them in chapels, councils and classrooms. &nbsp;We had counseled, cried and laughed together.&nbsp; They are my brothers and sisters.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am strengthened every day by their examples and their testimonies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still other friends of mine have faced serious challenges in their lives and I am still strengthened by&nbsp; the grace and courage and strength with which they bravely faced their challenges.&nbsp; Whenever I am with them, I frequently reflect on how much I have learned from them about how the Lord comforts us in our afflictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, every robust home storage has some foundational element such as wheat or potato flakes or boxes of green jello powder.&nbsp; In a similar fashion our spiritual food storage must have some central elements.&nbsp; May I suggest to you these elements are the words of prophets both ancient and modern and the temple.&nbsp; With regard to the scriptures, please consider the Book of Mormon as an example.&nbsp; Language used to describe this book of scripture helps illustrate the nature of it as a storage form of spiritual nutrients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Nephi 5:21</p>
<p>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1 Nephi 3:20</p>
<p>And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.</p>
<p>2 Nephi 25: 21-22</p>
<p>Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I awrite shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never bperish as long as the earth should stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be ajudged of them according to the words which are written.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">Jacob 1: 2-3</p>
<p>And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Next time you are reading it, take a few moments to look for such key words as &ldquo;record&rdquo;, store, seal up, or preserve.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s not exactly like canning, bottling or pickling, but those words evoke the feeling of storage.&nbsp; This literally is a kind of storage that has been assembled for us by others.&nbsp; Specifically, the nutrients were hand picked by the prophet Mormon who &ldquo;saw our day&rdquo; (Mormon 8:25) &nbsp;and knew what we would need, just as my parents seemed to know what my wife and I needed from their food storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple is not just a type of spiritual food storage, it is &ldquo;The Storehouse&rdquo;.&nbsp; Everything about the temple is designed to cause us to remember our relationship to our heavenly father, his plan for us and his never ending efforts and interest in our spiritual progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for those of you that don&rsquo;t already have your eyes closed, please take a moment and close them.&nbsp; Imagine walking down the well-worn stairs leading to your spiritual pantry.&nbsp; Take a few moments to take stock of your spiritual stores.&nbsp; Are the shelves burgeoning with spiritual experiences and memories that you can call upon as you need them?&nbsp; Do you get a satisfying sense of sufficiency, preparation and spritual self reliance or are there gaps on the shelves?&nbsp; Is it dusty, somewhat barren and in need of stocking?&nbsp;&nbsp; Now evaluate how you have used this store.&nbsp; Are you pulling from it regularly to supplement your daily spiritual menu?&nbsp; Do you find yourself taking to time to reflect on your spiritual experiences and remembering the tender mercies of the Lord in your life and recognizing his hand in your life?&nbsp; Are you sharing your spiritual stores generously and appropriately with others by using your spiritual experiences and bearing your testimonies in both word and deed and using them to guide your actions as you work to spiritually nourish those around you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the parallels that I have suggested between a home food storage and a spiritual food storage.&nbsp; There is an interesting paradoxical difference between them.&nbsp; Unlike a home food storage, when you use or share from your spiritual food stores, the stores are amplified not diminished.&nbsp; Just as he widow who was blessed by Elijah, as she used and shared from her store of food, her cruse of oil and measure of meal were not depleted, they were replenished (1 Kings 17:16).&nbsp; Share from your spiritual stores regularly and generously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I conclude with a scripture and a challenge.&nbsp; Going back to the theme of storing what we can when we reap in abundance, may I suggest that you are at a time and a place of spiritual plenty.&nbsp; The theme of harvest is as deep within this institution. I do not believe that it is a coincidence that a place like this is set in a valley where the law of the harvest is such an integral part of our heritage, so much so that the symbol of sheaves of wheat are incorporated into the decorations of our temple on the hill.&nbsp; It may be that you will never again be in a place of such abundance. &nbsp;The entire focus of the administration, staff and faculty of this place is upon your temporal and spiritual well-being.&nbsp; Your access to spiritual good will, and wealth of testimony is part of what sets this place apart.&nbsp; If you do not feel within your heart of hearts that this is the case, then you have yet to discover the true nature of this place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all this in mind, let us read together this scripture.&nbsp; I am taking it out of the context in which you typically hear it, but I believe it is applicable to the thesis of my talk.&nbsp; Please turn to Doctrine and Covenants 4:4:</p>
<p>For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Next turn to a similar scriptures in Doctrine and Covenants 6:3:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Will you accept a challenge from me to do just as these scriptures suggest?&nbsp; While you are here, thrust in your sickle.&nbsp; Take advantage of as many spiritual opportunities as you can. Harvest deeply and lay up in store.&nbsp; Learn to take time every day to look at how richly the Lord has blessed you.&nbsp; Record your impressions and reflect upon them frequently.&nbsp; May the Lord of the Harvest who watches over all who labor in his vineyard bless our bounty for our good.&nbsp; I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with a quiz.&nbsp; The quiz is easy; it only has one question, and the answer is obvious.&nbsp; Here is your quiz:</p>
<p>Multiple choice:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I prefer my life to be filled with . . . &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;order and security </em></p>
<p><em>B.&nbsp; disorder and insecurity</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there are a few mavericks among you who selected option B, &ldquo;disorder and insecurity,&rdquo; and did so simply to be contrary.&nbsp; But down deep, even those few would not really agree with that answer.&nbsp; By our very nature, we both crave and seek a sense of order and security in our lives.&nbsp; That remains true independent of the fact that many of you live in apartments that resemble certified disaster zones and many of you regularly fail to lock your apartment doors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why did I give you such a simple quiz?&nbsp; <strong>The reason is because the implications of the answer are not near as obvious as is the answer itself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Many years ago, Brother Hugh Nibley taught that &ldquo;Order and security are the exception in this world.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>&nbsp;I find that to be a most interesting thought.&nbsp; We can easily recognize its truth, but how often do we consciously consider just how completely foreign this telestial world is to our eternal natures?&nbsp; Without question, people living in all nations of the earth are regularly confronted with disorder and insecurity at every turn. &nbsp;Truly, &ldquo;order and security are the exception in this world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father desires that we have order and security in our lives.&nbsp; And He has provided abundant guidance to help us do so.&nbsp; With that in mind, let&rsquo;s consider Doctrine and Covenants 52:14.</p>
<p><em>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.</em></p>
<p>I wish to spend most of the time today talking about a few aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s pattern&ndash; a pattern given to help us avoid being deceived by Satan and to help us have order and security in our lives.&nbsp; But before we reflect on the Lord&rsquo;s pattern, let&rsquo;s first consider the thought that Satan also has what we might think of as a pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Satan&rsquo;s pattern we see constant evidence of disorder and insecurity.&nbsp; His pattern is one of destruction, temptation, deception, and distraction.&nbsp; It is a pattern evidenced by being acted upon and by being seduced to yield our agency one subtle step at a time.&nbsp; Rarely are Satan&rsquo;s tactics in-our-face, so-to-speak, but rather they target us from behind or to the side with the intent of catching us off-guard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago in a luncheon setting on this campus, President Henry B. Eyring, who was then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, was asked what are the primary concerns currently facing the Church.&nbsp; He replied that one of the more serious concerns impacting many Church members, particularly those the age of university students, is <strong><em>&ldquo;an unrelenting creep of worldliness into the lives of active members.&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp; His answer struck me powerfully, and I have thought about it many times in the intervening years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In parallel to President Eyring&rsquo;s comment are the words of President Boyd K. Packer when he taught:</p>
<p><em>The trend [in the world] to more noise, more excitement,&hellip; less restraint, less dignity, less formality </em><em>is not coincidental, nor innocent, nor harmless.&nbsp; The first order issued by a commander mounting a military invasion, is the jamming of channels of communication of those he intends to conquer.</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Each of us has seen ample evidence of the truth of President Eyring and President Packer&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; But I wonder, if we are as inclined as we should be in looking inward, at our own lives, to determine the degree to which their concerns apply to us?&nbsp; Please consider how easy it is for any of us to get attracted to various aspects of the ways of the world and to be pulled toward them&ndash;even while remaining unaware of the degree to which it is happening to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In being drawn toward the things of this world, we can be misled in how we view <em>righteousness </em>verses how we view<em> wickedness.&nbsp; </em>We can easily come to the erroneous conclusion that if something is not wicked then it must be okay.&nbsp; As my wife and I raised our six children, we tried to help them understand the reality that if something is not wicked then it may or may not be okay.&nbsp; It is not as simple as many would like to make it.&nbsp; There is, I believe, a gap between righteousness and wickedness.&nbsp; The gap between righteousness and wickedness is filled with things that are frivolous and with things that are foolish.&nbsp; As we honestly reflect on the reality of such a gap, we can rightfully conclude that merely avoiding wickedness is not the same thing as living righteously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a brief experience that illustrates this point.&nbsp; Several years ago, in a priesthood meeting discussion that became sidetracked in considering the differences between righteousness and wickedness, a sincere brother observed that he didn&rsquo;t feel that deliberately speeding would keep someone out of the celestial kingdom.&nbsp; Others in the class disagreed with him.&nbsp; Back and forth the discussion went for a couple of minutes.&nbsp; The answer was made clear when a very wise, older brother stated, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the <em>action</em> of speeding will keep you out of the Celestial kingdom, but I am confident that the <em>attitude</em> that will allow you to speed will keep you out.&rdquo;&nbsp; All of us in the class instantly knew that we had heard a profound truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the spirit of that truth ringing in your ears, consider again the thought that merely avoiding wickedness is not the same thing as living righteously. &nbsp;Down deep we know that is true.&nbsp; Down deep we know that we are not here simply for a casual visit to obtain a body, to do a few spiritual calisthenics, and to top it off with having a great time.&nbsp; Down deep, we intuitively know the essential purposes of being upon this earth go far deeper.&nbsp; But we don&rsquo;t always behave as though we do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are we so inclined to hold onto many of the ways of this world?&nbsp; Why are we so easily distracted from the core purposes of this life?&nbsp; Well, of course a major part of the answer is that <em>distraction</em> is one of best tactics used by Satan.&nbsp; If he can&rsquo;t successfully tempt us with one thing or another, then he will work to distract us.&nbsp; For his purposes, distraction can serve just as well as temptation.&nbsp; Satan is a master of deception.&nbsp; He is adept at placing non-wicked, worldly things and behaviors before us to compete for our attention.&nbsp; In and of themselves, these worldly things may not keep us from eternal life, but instead they can keep us from tending to those things that are essential to our eternal welfare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us now consider the Lord&rsquo;s pattern for us.&nbsp; I begin by acknowledging that I am neither qualified enough nor eloquent enough to describe it well, but I feel that my deep love for the gospel qualifies me sufficiently to make a sincere attempt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s pattern is indeed a pattern of order and security.&nbsp; We can recognize it by the feelings of calm it brings to our lives.&nbsp; We are blessed to receive comforting confirmation from the Holy Ghost as we adhere to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also recognize the Lord&rsquo;s pattern by the responsibility it brings.&nbsp; It requires something from us.&nbsp; It requires effort and commitment.&nbsp; It is a pattern of invitation where we must exercise our agency in receiving it into our lives.&nbsp; While we have many commandments given to us and we are blessed as we keep them, our greater opportunity is to do as we are admonished in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 58:26-27.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</em></p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s pattern is also a pattern of serving others.&nbsp; This is particularly true in this dispensation. &nbsp;No other people in the history of this earth have had the opportunity to do so much for so many people as we have today.&nbsp; What an exceptional blessing you have as students at this university to be learning how to serve others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all else, the Lord&rsquo;s pattern is a pattern of learning how to reverence and to honor those things which are sacred.&nbsp; As we learn more fully to keep the ways of the world out of our hearts and increase our reverence for things sacred, then we may be blessed in having order and security as a part of our lives independent of whatever level of turmoil is present upon the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we learn the Lord&rsquo;s pattern?&nbsp; I believe the structure already set forth for us as members of the Church will show the way.&nbsp; We have opportunities to attend our church meetings and to keep the Sabbath day holy, to hold our family home evenings, to pray regularly and sincerely, to study the scriptures, to study the words of living prophets, to faithfully fulfill our callings and assignments, to attend the temple, and to do many other things expected of us.&nbsp; All of these are given to assist us in learning and living the Lord&rsquo;s pattern.&nbsp; You will note that my list contains nothing new. &nbsp;It is the same outward expectations you have grown up with.&nbsp; However, please consider that there are inward dimensions involved in each of those things listed&ndash;truly our greater task is to internalize all that we have been given.&nbsp; This task of internalizing the gospel, or as the Apostle Paul phrased it, &ldquo;having it written &lsquo;in the fleshy tables of [our] hearts,&rsquo;&rdquo; <sup>3</sup> is where we increasingly need to be putting faithful and consistent effort all the days of our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me the temple has been an ideal place to see the Lord&rsquo;s pattern and to observe how to internalize it.&nbsp; In the balance of our time together today I wish to share some of what I have learned from the temple in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, it is instructive to consider that the word <em>temple</em>, from its Latin root word,<em> templum</em>, denotes a template or a pattern.<sup>4</sup> The word temple can also suggest an <em>observatory</em> where one can take a bearing on things.<sup>5</sup> Certainly, for us, the temple is a place that should become a template or a pattern from which we can view and guide our lives.&nbsp; It is a place where we can observe and, more importantly, feel constant and correct patterns and take an unerring bearing on things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many of you know being in the temple can touch our feelings very deeply, perhaps more deeply than others of you might suppose.&nbsp; During the open house of the Rexburg Temple in early 2008, I was blessed to lead a few tours.&nbsp; In doing so, I had an unforgettable opportunity to witness just how quickly and how profoundly the temple can touch people.&nbsp; A temple open house will attract many different kinds of people.&nbsp; In an area such as this, many will be active members of the Church wishing to bring their children or other family members to experience the beauty and serenity of the temple.&nbsp; However other people, inactive members and those of other faiths, will also attend, perhaps only out of simple curiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp; They might not be interested in the Church but just be curious to walk through a building that soon will be inaccessible to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you about one such family.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a family of three&mdash;a father, mother, and an approximately sixteen or seventeen-year-old daughter.&nbsp; Each of them had the definite appearance of being very worldly.&nbsp; Certainly they did not look like folks you would remotely expect to see in your Church meetings on Sunday.&nbsp; They stood out distinctly among the other people on the tour.&nbsp; While they were respectful as we proceeded through the tour, they maintained a steady demeanor of aloofness and indifference.&nbsp; Their very manner repeatedly seemed to say, &ldquo;We are not buying into what you are telling us.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, this changed quite suddenly when we got to the celestial room in the temple.&nbsp; I was not expecting the change that came upon them, and they were expecting it even less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just prior to entering the celestial room, tour groups were informed that while in that room there would be no talking, but that each person on the tour could use the quiet minutes there to contemplate the reality of a loving Heavenly Father and the concern He has for them.&nbsp; As we entered the room I found myself standing directly opposite this family, where I was able to discretely observe them.&nbsp; Within 30 seconds of being in the celestial room, the wife, with a sudden look of surprise upon her face, began to cry.&nbsp; Her husband, sensing this, looked at her in disbelief, and then he too started to cry.&nbsp; The daughter then turned toward them both and her jaw literally dropped in astonishment as she just stared at them for several seconds before she abruptly burst into tears as well.&nbsp; I watched as this family then fell into each other&rsquo;s arms and wept quietly together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How beautiful a contrast in attentiveness they showed when we went next to a sealing room.&nbsp; You could see in each of their eyes a depth of earnest interest regarding the message that families may be sealed together for time and for all eternity.&nbsp; I would love to know if other changes in their lives have come from the feelings they jointly experienced in the temple that day. &nbsp;Of one thing I am certain, they walked out of the temple with very different feelings from the feelings they had when they walked in earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That family was able to get an initial feeling for the very things from which we need to be regularly and intensely feeling.&nbsp; The temple will indeed help us see our lives from a correct perspective.&nbsp; The temple helps us sort through or avoid the myriad of worldly distractions that compete for our attention in this demanding and perplexing telestial world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple helps us see order, purpose, and beauty amidst the blur of chaos and wickedness that surrounds us.&nbsp; The temple provides us a vista where we might see, and hear, and feel the calm, the peace, and the promise of eternity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me the pattern of learning begins upon entering the temple.&nbsp; The requirement to provide evidence of our worthiness has a reassuring dimension.&nbsp; Upon contemplation, we can see that the level of worthiness that allows us to enter the temple is not a price to be paid but an investment in ourselves and in our families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the temple we can learn from the basic process of setting aside the attire of the world and clothing ourselves to do the work of a better one.&nbsp; In the course of changing clothes, we should learn to leave within our lockers all the cares and concerns that accompany us on a given day.&nbsp; Certainly there is a wonderful lesson or two in this thought alone that we can teach and apply within the walls of our own homes.&nbsp; Our homes should be a refuge, and many of the issues and problems of this world should be left at our doorstep as we return home to our families each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the designated manner of dress within the temple, we can observe an appropriate pattern for our manner of dress outside of the temple.&nbsp; The lesson I learn is that our clothing should be (1) modest, (2) conservatively tasteful, and (3) not used to draw attention to ourselves.&nbsp; I have found it wise to allow these three considerations to have a significant influence on my clothing decisions.&nbsp; Overall though, I have learned that our attire is not nearly as effective in showing who we are as is having the image of the Savior in our countenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can readily observe that throughout the temple there are many good people in place to assist and instruct us.&nbsp; In daily life, we should strive to maintain this pattern&mdash;hence the opportunity to see home teaching and visiting teaching as much more than just a monthly visit.&nbsp; Further, there are opportunities to draw from this pattern in striving to be better roommates, friends, husbands and wives, more effective parents, and more dedicated teachers and leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the vital lessons of the temple is observing how the Lord responds individually to His children.&nbsp; Temple experiences are one-by-one experiences.&nbsp; We can take great comfort from this pattern in learning that the Lord, indeed, does know us individually and seeks to teach us and guide us accordingly.&nbsp; How evident this is as we discover that in the temple, the true teacher is the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; And in the temple, more than perhaps any other area of gospel learning, we find that the deeper lessons are individually felt rather than voiced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all things on the face of the earth, we see that all things within the temple denote that there is a God and that He has provided a Savior for us.&nbsp; At every turn, we feel of the love our Father has for His children.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the temple we can observe that the very commandments are but a reflection of the attributes of God that we need to develop while on this earth.&nbsp; Therefore, we can see that the commandments have been given only for the purpose of blessing us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the temple we find ample witness that all of the promises of the Lord are sure.&nbsp; There, we feel the reality of increased faith as we move forward in our lives.&nbsp; There, we feel the reality of added hope&ndash;the unequaled and unqualified assurance and confidence&ndash;that we can succeed as we persevere in our efforts to gain education, to launch a career, to marry, to raise righteous families, and to endure whatever trials may come to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the temple we are able to learn that all things possessed by the Lord, and promised to us as His children if we are true and faithful, are things that can be given freely, without limit.&nbsp; Unlike the physical things of this world, the gifts of God increase and enlarge when shared.&nbsp; And unlike the things highly valued in this world, their value does not increase in relation to their exclusiveness.&nbsp; Rather, the value of the gifts of God appears to increase based on their inclusiveness.&nbsp; Hence, when we share of our worldly substance, the outcome will be that we will have less of whatever it was that we shared.&nbsp; In contrast, when we share of the gifts of God&ndash;things such as faith, hope, charity, truth, wisdom and knowledge &ndash;the outcome will be that we enlarge our portion of the very things which we share.&nbsp; This reality should guide us regularly with respect to those things we set our hearts and energies upon.&nbsp; Consequently, we can learn to be more content with the limited range of the things of this world that we truly need and to be increasingly free in sharing all that we possess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learn in the temple that the Lord has placed His messengers here upon the earth.&nbsp; And we have confirmed to us that His messengers are apostles and prophets.&nbsp; We see the pattern, that in many things (perhaps in most things), the Lord provides direction to His children through those messengers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the temple we have confirmed to us that our natural-man tendencies have bounds placed upon them.&nbsp; From this we can conclude that we would be wise to cease to seek out the outer edges of what is acceptable within the requirements of the gospel.&nbsp; Rather, we should increasingly seek to find ways to strengthen, deepen, and broaden the range of our commitment.&nbsp; Thereby, we will find ourselves continually growing rather than simply holding the line at a minimal level of acceptance.&nbsp; I am confident that in this increasingly wicked world we need to personally be raising our own bar of righteousness and continually distancing ourselves from anything that might harm us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the temple we can observe that the commandments, like the covenants that flow from them and which we take upon ourselves, are ascending in nature.&nbsp; Each takes us to a higher level and provides us with a more expansive perspective.&nbsp; As we progress in this way, we learn that not only do the commandments and our covenants not limit or restrict us, but we see that they free us more completely.&nbsp; Keeping them will, line-upon-line, allow us the expanding privilege and blessing of seeing what God sees, knowing what He knows, and feeling what He feels.&nbsp; It is truly the path of becoming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all that we learn in the temple, nothing in my awareness is of greater significance than what we learn of our Savior and of the breadth and depth of His works and His atonement.&nbsp; That remains the pattern of the temple that we need most to be seeking to comprehend and to be led in following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is both a privilege and a responsibility to attend the temple.&nbsp; I testify that we should attend regularly and, in the course of so doing, we should continually take our bearing on matters of eternity and observe patterns we can apply in our homes and in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us take from the temple the pattern of how to live within our own homes and families.&nbsp; Let us increasingly strive to have our homes become places of refuge within a wilderness of wickedness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the pattern found in the temple, let our homes be peaceful and purposeful.&nbsp; Let our homes be places of unpretentious beauty, free of disorder, distractions, and discord.&nbsp; Let them be places where love and concern for others is fundamental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the pattern found in the temple, let us build and bind the family circle both within the walls of our homes and beyond.&nbsp; Let us teach our children and others to recognize how individually precious they are to the Lord.&nbsp; Let us also teach the blessings and duties of being part of eternal family units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the pattern found in the temple, let us foster within our lives an understanding of and commitment to the eternal purposes of our Heavenly Father and His Son.&nbsp; Let us build settings where the Holy Ghost is ever invited and ever included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is our right and our privilege to experience these things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m thrilled and somewhat terrified to be here with you today!&nbsp; You may not believe this, but I think I&rsquo;ve actually lost more of my hair since learning about this assignment&hellip; That actually works in my favor because with the lighting in here all you&rsquo;re likely to see is a glowing ball on top of my shoulders!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like you, I truly desire to learn together today, and so I add my prayers to yours that the Holy Ghost will attend to us and teach us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my lifetime I&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time wondering about the future &ndash; anxious to know how everything will turn out. &nbsp;I remember pausing in front of my bathroom mirror when I was in Jr. High &ndash; staring intently at my face and body &ndash; even posing and flexing as only a 14 year old can.&nbsp; I wondered what I might look like as an adult &ndash; and what <em>she</em> would look like!&nbsp; I tried to imagine where this body would take me, and what I would do with it.&nbsp; In those especially turbulent years I had a pervading fear of mortality&rsquo;s randomness, and a keen and painful awareness of my own failings and weakness.&nbsp; Perhaps as a cover for those fears, during my adolescence I held romantic notions about the &ldquo;test&rdquo; of life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a little embarrassed to admit that I sometimes play-acted in my mind how I would bravely stick out my chest as I faced nefarious enemies, boldly refusing to deny my testimony as I died a thousand different deaths.&nbsp; I figured that if I could land myself in one of these life-or-death situations then I would be assured a place among the greats in heaven.&nbsp; In my heart of hearts, I worried that unless I had such an epic end, my mortal days would not add up to an invitation to enter the Celestial Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we begin, I have felt impressed to share with you two experiences I had when I was your age.&nbsp; As you will see, I had much to learn about the true nature of God&rsquo;s plan of salvation!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One night in the Missionary Training Center while preparing to preach the gospel in Japan I had an unusual dream.&nbsp; I found myself striding down a beautiful tree-lined path.&nbsp; &nbsp;The sun was setting amid lightly falling leaves and I realized I was walking on a rich-red carpet.&nbsp; Suddenly I heard the clear notes of royal court trumpets and I had the sense that I&rsquo;d just passed through one of those idealistic life-on-the-line tests I fantasized about.&nbsp; I immediately understood that I was ascending up to the throne of God!&nbsp; As I passed between rows of noble-looking people on either side, I was filled with wonder over what I sensed would be my final judgment.&nbsp; As an aside, keep in mind that I&rsquo;m just 19, I&rsquo;m in the MTC, and I&rsquo;ve been a fan of King Arthur since I was old enough to know what swords and fair maidens were! &nbsp;As I climbed the steps on that deep red carpet I saw a jewel-encrusted gold crown resting on a luxurious purple pillow.&nbsp; I envisioned Heavenly Father taking the Sword of Laban and tapping me on each shoulder as if I were being &ldquo;knighted&rdquo;!&nbsp; I anticipated receiving the keys to some corner of the cosmos and told, &ldquo;Go and be awesome.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that very moment, everything ended abruptly.&nbsp; In the darkness a clear voice declared, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Sleeplessly, I was left to ponder&hellip; so, if the Judgment isn&rsquo;t like that, what is it like?!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Even though I asked that night, I didn&rsquo;t receive an answer to that question immediately&mdash;in fact, it has been a significant part of my personal gospel searching ever since.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to explore with you today what I&rsquo;ve been learning about how the gospel really works since that dream in the MTC when the Lord kindly, but firmly dashed my romantic and idealistic notions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the second experience: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d only been home from my mission a couple days when I stopped in to see my mother who was just finishing up another academic year of teaching Spanish and English at my high school.&nbsp; As I passed under sagging banners swaying from the ceiling I reminisced about the three somewhat angst-filled years of my life I&rsquo;d spent there.&nbsp; Without warning I suddenly found myself nose-to-nose with one of my former teachers.&nbsp; She had absent-mindedly entered the hallway with a stack of papers in her hands and we nearly collided.&nbsp; As she looked up into my face she said one of the more memorable things I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&nbsp; She said: &ldquo;You look holy&rdquo;! &nbsp;What?! Me&hellip; Holy?&hellip; &nbsp;Her unexpected greeting was particularly surprising because she was not a member of the Church, and it had been no secret that she harbored negative feelings about Church as well.&nbsp; As I recovered from my shock, I was pleased to tell her that I&rsquo;d just returned from a mission. &nbsp;I was hopeful that this experience might be a seed to better things regarding the restored gospel for her.&nbsp; As we parted, I was floored by the implications of her observation.&nbsp; &hellip; Me&hellip; Holy&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2005 October General Conference, Sister Susan W. Tanner serving as the Young Women&rsquo;s General President explained,</p>
<p>When we become other-oriented, or selfless, we develop an inner beauty of spirit that glows in our outward appearance. This is how we make ourselves in the Lord&rsquo;s image rather than the world&rsquo;s and receive His image in our countenances.&rdquo; (Sister Susan W. Tanner, &ldquo;The Sanctity of the Body,&rdquo; <em>Ensign</em>, Nov 2005, 13).<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2009_12_08_Allred.htm/#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>[</sup></a><a name="endref2" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref2" target="_self"><sup>2]</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>I had seen this happen in other&rsquo;s lives in the mission field, but up that point I had no idea that such a change was also happening in me! <a href="#ref3" target="_self"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a name="endref3" target="_self"></a> &nbsp; However preliminary and unfinished it was, I had begun to receive Christ&rsquo;s image in my countenance &ndash; in a literal and discernable way.&nbsp; Over the years since my teacher&rsquo;s startling statement, I&rsquo;ve searched the gospel to understand this dynamic connection between our spirits and our bodies; and, by extension just how that informs our real test of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following four sentences are my distillations of gospel doctrines and principles relating to our bodies and their spiritual properties.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we contemplate each of these statements today, I will lean heavily on the teachings of the modern Prophets.&nbsp; Their words will both warn and comfort us.&nbsp; As President Harold B. Less once said, &ldquo;&hellip;this is what the Church is all about&mdash;to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comforted&rdquo; (<em>New Era</em>, Jan 1971).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure representatives of each camp are among us.&nbsp; I know I&rsquo;ve spent time among both groups at different times in my life.&nbsp; Wonderfully, the Spirit will direct and inspire each of us to appropriately apply these principles so that we are sufficiently enabled to come unto Jesus and become perfected in him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I remember as a child seeing all the creative &ldquo;you are what you eat&rdquo; lunch-room posters that humorously portrayed people turning into walking Twinkies or Cupcakes.&nbsp; Between you and me, all that did was sour my appreciation for the banana in my lunchbox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here follow five Prophet&rsquo;s statements that teach us about this spiritual recording property of our bodies and attest to the fact that we&rsquo;re not only what we eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>From President John Taylor: </em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;</em>I could show you upon scientific principles that man himself is a self-registering machine, his eyes, his ears, his nose, the touch, the taste, and all the various senses of the body, are so many media whereby man lays up for himself a record&hellip;&rdquo; (Pres. John Taylor, <em>Journal of Discourses,</em> 26:32.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>From Elder Bruce R. McConkie: </em></p>
<p>In a real though figurative sense, the book of life is the record of the acts of men as such record is written in their own bodies. It is the record engraven on the very bones, sinews, and flesh of the mortal body. That is, every thought, word, and deed has an effect on the human body; all these leave their marks&hellip; (Elder Bruce R. McConkie, <em>Mormon Doctrine,</em> 97.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Again from Pres. Taylor: </em></p>
<p>God has made each man a register within himself&hellip;. Your eyes and ears have taken it in, and your hands have touched it&hellip; (Pres. John Taylor, <em>Journal of Discourses, </em>11:77-80).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>From President David O. McKay: </em></p>
<p>Psychology assures us that &lsquo;We are spinning our own fates, good or evil&hellip; Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little scar&hellip;. Down among his nerve cells and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering and storing it up to be used against him when the next temptation comes. (Pres. David O. McKay, quoting William James in <em>Conference Report, </em>April 1956, 7-8.) <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>From Spencer W. Kimball: </em></p>
<p>There are dark, deep corners, locked rooms, isolated spots, but no act, good or bad; no thought, ugly or beautiful ever escapes being seen or heard.&nbsp; [Each] one will make the imprint on the individual and be recorded, to be met and paid for.&nbsp; (Pres. Spencer W. Kimball, <em>Teaching of Spencer W. Kimball</em>, 155.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&rsquo;d imagine that we&rsquo;ve all had experiences with people whose countenance revealed something of their spiritual state &ndash; be it &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; or &ldquo;beautiful.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember being shocked by one man I met in the music-recording industry.&nbsp; He showed up one day when I was working as a disc jockey at a radio station.&nbsp; He was hoping I&rsquo;d play his song on the air, but as we talked, I became unnerved by the darkness in his whole person; particularly in his eyes and face.&nbsp; He told me that I wouldn&rsquo;t believe what he&rsquo;d done to get there.&nbsp; I thought to myself, you&rsquo;d don&rsquo;t have to tell me friend, you&rsquo;re whole body is blaring it!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Well did Isaiah say it anciently:&nbsp; &ldquo;The shew of their countenance doth witness against them&hellip; Woe unto their soul! For they have rewarded evil unto themselves.&rdquo; (Isa. 3:9-11).&nbsp; How tragic that this son of God had wasted his precious time on earth misunderstanding the true &ldquo;recording industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t just been recording a song &ndash; he was recording himself!&nbsp; And so are we all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, our scientists are beginning to understand how biochemical changes in our brains take place via our physical senses.&nbsp; It appears we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface of how profoundly we are daily creating and changing ourselves.&nbsp; Just between us, I&rsquo;d sure love to know what senses I need to engage to pave my mathematical neuropath ways!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t shock you with my ACT score on that one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Prophets are saying that our bodies have been recording everything.&nbsp; In his second letter to the Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10, Paul attests to these modern prophets when he wrote: &ldquo;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:10).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider how the following three teachings shed light on the fact that these bodies of ours will be instrumental in our Final Judgment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>From our Church-produced manual Gospel Principles: </em></p>
<p>There is another record that will be used to judge us.&nbsp; The Apostle Paul taught that man himself is the most complete record of his life (see Romans 2:15; 2 Cor. 3:1-3).&nbsp; Stored in our body and mind is a complete history of everything we have done.&nbsp; (<em>Gospel Principles</em>, 284.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>From Pres. John Taylor: </em></p>
<p>Man sleeps for a time in the grave, and by-and-by he rises again from the dead and goes to judgment &hellip; it would be in vain for a man to say then, I did not do so-and-so; the command would be, Unravel and read the record which he has made of himself, and let it testify in relation to these things, and all could gaze upon it. It is not because somebody has seen things, or heard anything by which a man will be judged and condemned, but it is because that record that is written by the man himself in the tablets of his own mind&mdash;that record that cannot lie&mdash;will in that day be unfolded before God and angels, and those who shall sit as judges&hellip; (Pres. John Taylor, <em>Journal of Discourses, </em>11:78-79).</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>From Elder Bruce R. McConkie: </em></p>
<p>When the book of life is opened in the day of judgment (Rev. 20:12-15), men's bodies will show what law they have lived. The Great Judge will then read the record of the book of their lives; the account of their obedience or disobedience will be written in their bodies. (quoted in <em>LDS Church News</em>, 26 June, 1993; from <em>Mormon Doctrine</em>, 97).</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Alma taught his spiritually-struggling son Corianton that our resurrected bodies will carry their record forward into our final judgment. <a name="endref6" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref6" target="_self"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&nbsp; You remember how this young missionary had strayed from his duties and debauched himself with a local Zoramite siren.<em>&nbsp; </em>In Alma chapter 40 verse 21 and chapter 41 verses 4 and 13, Alma taught,&nbsp;</p>
<p>that there is a time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be <em>reunited</em>, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works&hellip;. and if their works are evil they shall be <em>restored</em> unto them for evil.&nbsp; Therefore, all things shall <em>be restored</em> to their proper order, everything to its natural frame&hellip;. the meaning of the word <em>restoration</em> is to bring back again evil for evil&hellip; [or] good for that which is good (Alma 40:21; 41:4, 13; emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul put it even more succinctly in his first letter to the Corinthians, chapter six verse eighteen:&nbsp; &ldquo;he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:18).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think now how profoundly simple and true it is when Alma states in Alma chapter 41 verse 7, that &ldquo;they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil&rdquo; (Alma 41:7).&nbsp; President Harold B. Lee explained,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are our own judges of the place we shall have in the eternal world. Here and now in mortality, each one of us is having the opportunity of choosing the kind of laws we elect to obey. We are now living and obeying celestial laws that will make us candidates for celestial glory, or we are living terrestrial laws that will make us candidates for either terrestrial glory, or telestial law. (Elder Harold B. Lee, <em>Conference Report, April 1947</em>, 46). <a href="#ref7" target="_self"><sup>[7]</sup></a><a name="endref7" target="_self"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Because this is true, we should be taking advantage of this incomparable self-registering gift in our physical bodies because as Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Godly] attributes and skills are portable, [they] are never obsolete; they will be much needed in the next world.&nbsp; If we ponder just what it is that will rise with us in the resurrection, it seems clear that our intelligence will rise with us, meaning not simply our IQ, but also our capacity to receive and apply truth.&nbsp; Our talents, attributes, and skills will rise with us; certainly also our capacity to learn, our degree of self-discipline, and our capacity to work. (Elder Neal A. Maxwell, <em>We Will Prove Them Herewith</em>, 11-12).</p>
<p>When I first came across these prophetic and scriptural statements, I was stunned.&nbsp; For some reason I hadn&rsquo;t really connected the dots!&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;d incorrectly assumed some things about the resurrection. <a href="#ref8" target="_self"><sup>[8]</sup></a><a name="endref8" target="_self"></a> &nbsp; But, being confronted with this doctrine that I will stand <em>in this body</em> before the Lord to be judged, I honestly thought, &ldquo;Well, so much for that gold crown and those keys to the cosmos!&rdquo;&nbsp; I know all too well what I&rsquo;ve done in this body.&nbsp; It is easy to see how this reality might engender feelings of defeat and hopelessness in those without a more developed gospel understanding.&nbsp; However, it is the same gospel that humbles us with these realities that also brings us the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; about Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; Our next two principles show us how the Lord can help us rewrite our lives &ndash; literally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught that through the Savior&rsquo;s atoning sacrifice there is a way to exchange our sinfulness for His righteousness.&nbsp; Let us turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verses 19 and 21.&nbsp; In verse 19 Paul explained to the Corinthians that Heavenly Father won&rsquo;t <em>impute</em> &ldquo;[our] trespasses unto [us]&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:19) because, as he so beautifully describes the atonement in verse 21: Jesus was &ldquo;made to be sin for us&hellip; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21).&nbsp; The Greek word translated as &ldquo;made&rdquo; (KJV) is <em>genometha</em>, and it means <em>to become, be, be born, be created</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of our modern prophets offer insight into how we can be <em>made</em> into &ldquo;the righteousness of God&rdquo; in spite of all the unrighteousness we have written in our bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>From Brigham Young: </em></p>
<p>&hellip;if we take a course to promote the principles of life&mdash;seek unto our Father and God, and obtain his will and perform it, the spirit will become purified, sanctified, cleansed, and made holy in the body, and the grave will cleanse the flesh. When the spirit overcomes the evil consequences of the fall, which are in the mortal tabernacle, it will reign predominant in the flesh, and is then prepared to be exalted&hellip; (Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 7: 287.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Again from Brigham Young: </em></p>
<p>&hellip;by obedience to the Gospel of salvation, and the renovating influences of the Holy Ghost, and the holy resurrection, we shall put on the image of the heavenly, in beauty, glory, power and goodness. (<em>Discourses of Brigham Young,</em> 373-74)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>From Joseph Fielding Smith: </em></p>
<p>If we will just be true and faithful to every covenant, to every principle of truth that he has given us, then after the resurrection we [will] come back into his presence and we [will] be just like he is.&nbsp; We [will] have the same kind of bodies&mdash;bodies that [will] shine like the sun. (Joseph Fielding Smith, <em>Take Heed to Yourselves!</em>, 345.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Again from Joseph Fielding Smith: </em></p>
<p>This idea, which has so often been taught by saying that the holes remain after the nails are withdrawn, is a false doctrine when applied to the atonement for the truly repentant sinner.&nbsp; (Joseph Fielding Smith, <em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 2:332; emphasis added.)</p>
<p>Alma actually uses this same language with Corianton in Alma chapter 40 verse 25 that through the restorative powers of the atonement &ldquo;then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; How remarkable it will be to stand before the Lord in that kind of resurrected body!&nbsp; And truly, through the grace of Christ and the power of his Atonement, this remarkable offer remains open to every one of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>You know, it wasn&rsquo;t long after my &ldquo;you look holy&rdquo; experience, however, that I painfully realized as the great poet Robert Frost so eloquently put it that I had &ldquo;miles to go before I sleep.&rdquo; <a name="endref9" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref9" target="_self"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp; There were multiple personal exhibits, of course, but I learned how just how far I yet needed to go in my discipleship and real conversion one terrible night years ago as a young father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early in my married life, one of my toddler sons would not go to bed without several hours of painstaking coddling every night.&nbsp; All our efforts that worked with our other children were fruitless with him.&nbsp; As the days, weeks, and months went by I came to dread bedtime and one night I snapped.&nbsp; After several hours of trying to settle him without success I caved in to the frustration and roughly picked him up, yelled in his face, and tossed him back down onto the bed.&nbsp; As I strode out of the room broiling with anger, the horror and shame of what I&rsquo;d done washed over me as I collapsed on the stairs and openly wept.&nbsp; I felt utterly hopeless and weak &ndash; all my worst fears over being a father seemed to be confirmed.&nbsp; It was awful.&nbsp; As I groped around in my mind for something, anything, to answer this terrible weakness toward anger and frustration that I had dealt with since I was a child, I felt the gentle tugging of the Spirit.&nbsp; As I listened with my freshly broken heart, I received a key gospel insight about how to receive the Lord&rsquo;s help, along with a spiritual invitation.&nbsp; Wonderfully, my helplessness turned to hope as I began that night to ponder and apply His invitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had come face to face with the crushing truth that Elder Oaks taught so well in his landmark address aptly titled &ldquo;The Challenge to Become&rdquo; in the October 2005 General Conference.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Jesus&rsquo; challenge shows that the conversion He required for those who would enter the kingdom of heaven (see Matt. 18:3) was far more than just being converted to testify to the truthfulness of the gospel. To testify is to <em>know</em> and to <em>declare.</em> The gospel challenges us to be &ldquo;converted,&rdquo; which requires us to <em>do</em> and to <em>become</em>&rdquo; (<em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 2000, 33).&nbsp; While I had testified of and knew and even loved the gospel truths, they had not yet worked their acceptable conversion in me, because somehow I was missing the Savior in all my doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very soon after this experience, I found an exciting statement about how to become truly converted by President George Q. Cannon.&nbsp; His fervent exhortation seemed to confirm what the Spirit had invited me to do the night of my extremity.&nbsp; Pres. Cannon urged us to be &ldquo;seeking for [the] gifts that God has promised to bestow&rdquo; instead of&nbsp;</p>
<p>[going] along day by day like a door turning on its hinges, without having any feeling on the subject, without exercising any faith whatever; content to be baptized and be members of the Church, and to rest there, thinking that your salvation is secure because you have done this? &hellip;If any of us are imperfect, it is our duty to pray for the gift that will make us perfect.&nbsp; Have I imperfections?&nbsp; I am full of them.&nbsp; What is my duty?&nbsp; To pray to God to give me the gifts that will correct these imperfections. (<em>Millennial Star</em>, 1894, 260-61.) <a name="endref10" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref10" target="_self"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>That night I had come so close to my imperfection and a life-changing accident that I felt sick!&nbsp; But, the Lord knows exactly each of our weaknesses and capacities as unique children of God.&nbsp; And so, as I began more earnestly and faithfully to seek for the Lord&rsquo;s perfecting gifts for me specifically, I learned that He often responds to our pleadings with very specific directions detailing an invitation for us to enter the next phase of our conversion.&nbsp; As we&rsquo;ve discussed today, since our bodies are constantly recording and registering, it only makes sense that the Savior will know perfectly what we need to do in order to receive more of His image in our countenances. <a name="endref11" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref11" target="_self"><sup>[11]</sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it significant that our last two presidents here at BYU-Idaho have both taught about this perfecting process by highlighting the Lord&rsquo;s use of what has been termed <em>personal commandments</em>.&nbsp; In a Devotional here in 2004, President David A. Bednar taught us, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is one thing to perform the <strong>outward actions </strong>of obedience; it is quite a different thing to<strong> become inwardly</strong> what the commandments are intended to help us become. It is one thing to obey the <strong>institutional</strong>, <strong>public</strong>, and <strong>shared</strong> commandments associated with the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom on earth&mdash;commandments such as the law of chastity, the law of tithing, and the Word of Wisdom; it is an even greater thing to receive and respond to the <strong>individual</strong>, <strong>private</strong>, and <strong>personally revealed</strong> commandments that result from continual and faithful obedience&hellip;. Such instructions typically are proactive and anticipatory in nature. (Elder David A. Bednar, &ldquo;In a State of Happiness,&rdquo; <em>Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho Devotional</em>, January 6, 2004; emphasis original)</p>
<p>&nbsp;And in 2006, President Kim B. Clark quoted Elder Bednar about these personal commandments and further taught that,</p>
<p>&nbsp;[The Lord] sends us promptings and impressions to raise our personal bar, over and over again.&nbsp; The impressions that come may be about fasting with a purpose, or forgiving one who has hurt us, or sharing the gospel, or searching the scriptures more diligently, or being more thoughtful and kind to neighbors and friends, or praying with real intent.&nbsp; They will be what the Lord wants you to do to become a stronger, more effective disciple.&nbsp; And they will not come just once.&nbsp; If you are true and faithful, they will come all through your life. (Pres. Kim B. Clark, &ldquo;God Hath Prepared A More Excellent Way,&rdquo; <em>BYU-Idaho Devotional, </em>September 5, 2006)</p>
<p>These two presidents of our University have verbalized and illustrated the very same process of literal conversion that the Lord invited me to engage in that awful night of my crisis with my son.&nbsp; I can tell you that it has been an exhilarating experience for me to receive and respond to the Lord&rsquo;s commandments to me since then.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found for myself that these personal commandments are tenderly and uniquely suited to our circumstances because they are designed to write the next and most needful good in us for that particular time in our lives &ndash; and they build upon each other over time.&nbsp; Both Presidents referred to the Lord&rsquo;s promise in the 59<sup>th</sup> Section of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, in verses 3 &amp; 4, those &ldquo;who have obeyed my gospel&rdquo; and &ldquo;are faithful and diligent before [Him] will &ldquo;be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with <em>commandments not a few</em>, and with <em>revelations in their time</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence our developing happiness is contingent upon the sequential nature of the Lord&rsquo;s commandments.&nbsp; Perhaps this helps explain what Joseph Smith meant when he taught that &ldquo;we cannot keep all the commandments without first knowing them, and we cannot expect to know all, or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we have already received.&rdquo; (Joseph Smith, Jr., <em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, 255; emphasis added.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Oaks explains that,</p>
<p>&nbsp;This spotless and perfected state will result from a steady succession of covenants, ordinances, and actions, an accumulation of right choices, and from continuing repentance. (Elder Dallin H. Oaks, &ldquo;The Challenge to Become&rdquo; <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 2000)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Considering all we&rsquo;ve been taught today about our incredible bodies, note the crucial role of the Spirit in facilitating these godly changes <em>in</em> us according to President Brigham Young.&nbsp; He promised that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cleave to holy, godlike principles, you add more good to your organization&hellip; And when you have been proved, and when you have labored and occupied sufficiently upon that, it will become in you&hellip; a fountain of revelation.&nbsp; That is true.&nbsp; After a while the Lord will say to such, &ldquo;My son, you have been faithful, you have clung to good, and you love righteousness, and hate iniquity, from which you have turned away, now you shall have the blessing of the Holy Spirit to lead you, and be your constant companion, from this time henceforth and forever.&nbsp; Then the Holy Spirit becomes your property. (Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses:</em> 2:134.)</p>
<p>In Alma chapter 18, Ammon confirms the remarkable <em>addition</em> capacities of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Alma 18, verse 35 reveals that &ldquo;a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.&rdquo; <a name="endref12" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref12" target="_self"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazingly, as we more fully immerse ourselves in discipleship by continually striving to incorporate the Lord&rsquo;s public and private commandments into our lives, we find our bodies becoming more and more holy as temples for the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit.&nbsp; This is why the Apostle Paul beseeched us - in his epistle to the Romans, chapter 12 verses 1 and 2 &ndash; to &ldquo;present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God&hellip;. Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is so exiting to realize how the gospel&rsquo;s public and personal commandments allow the Lord to really transform us.&nbsp; Elder Packer has suggested the Word of Wisdom is &ldquo;only incidentally to keep us healthy&rdquo; &ndash; and reminded us that the promise associated with this principle is &ldquo;personal revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, he continued, &ldquo;If you will keep your body in a worthy, receptive circumstance, you will be prompted, even have angels attend you&rdquo; (<em>CES Fireside for Young Adults</em>, 2 Feb. 2003). Keeping our bodies in this spiritually tuned state enables us to receive his personal commandments.<a name="endref13" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref13" target="_self"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining our best efforts and following His tutoring directions, think on the goodness is recorded in us when we worthily and mindfully partake of the Sacrament?&nbsp; Think of the godliness that is registered in us when we attend to the sacred, saving ordinances of the Lord&rsquo;s temples?<a name="endref14" target="_self"></a><a href="#ref14" target="_self"><sup> [14]</sup></a>&nbsp; In fact, notice how the <em>power of</em> <em>godliness</em> comes to us through the Melchizedek priesthood as taught by the Lord in D&amp;C 84:19-22, which reads,&nbsp;</p>
<p>therefore in the ordinances [of the Melchizedek] priesthood], the power of godliness is manifest. And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.</p>
<p>Two great prophets from dispensations past illustrate how literal that promise is.&nbsp; In Mosiah chapter 13 verse 5 &ndash; remember how Abinadi&rsquo;s &ldquo;face shone with exceeding luster, even as Moses&rsquo; did while in the mount of Sinai&rdquo; because of&nbsp; &ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord [that] was upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly the &ldquo;steady succession&rdquo; of faithful obedience by these two sons of God had transformed their bodies.&nbsp; By the way, in our study of the books of Moses and Exodus, we discover that Moses&rsquo; lustrous condition was not attained through a single climb up the mount.&nbsp; Rather, we can document no less than twelve separate ascents up Sinai logged by the Prophet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though it is truly sacred to me, I have felt the Lord&rsquo;s approval in sharing one final experience with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly a decade later after my terrible night with that son (he lived through it by the way), he and I participated in a 20-mile day-hike in preparation for our Ward&rsquo;s 50-mile super-activity.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see us in the photograph displayed.&nbsp; As the day went along, it became agonizingly apparent that my 12 year-old was physically and emotionally unprepared for the ordeal.&nbsp; I must tell you that he was complaining and murmuring to rival the Israelites with Moses.&nbsp; Normally when he would act this way, I would start to feel all kinds of mental and physical turmoil and tension that I knew could boil over at any time.&nbsp; Yet, mile after mile as we trudged along with his frustration and pain reaching greater and greater heights, I was amazed to notice my own feelings becoming deep, profound, and poignant. I felt a refining, purging and purifying power infuse in me a sanctifying love for my son.&nbsp; Because we were so slow, the group had gone ahead and it was just the two of us.&nbsp; As we slogged through the last five excruciating miles, it broke my heart to see my son struggle so much as I tried to help him in any way I could.&nbsp; It was during those final terrible yards that my dear son tearfully thanked me for staying with him.&nbsp; As I heard him thank me, I felt an overwhelming sense of love for him.&nbsp; Here was my son thanking me for staying with him!&nbsp; He had no idea that I could no more have left him and gone ahead with the others than I could have sprouted wings.&nbsp; Leaving him was simply not in me &ndash; not any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Then I knew that the Lord had worked a miracle in me.&nbsp; In those intervening years, the Savior had fashioned me into a true father to my son as He took &ldquo;the stony heart out of [my] flesh&rdquo; and &ldquo;put a new spirit within [me]&rdquo; (Ezekiel 11:19).&nbsp; By following his personal commandments his grace had become infused into my whole soul.&nbsp; His healing and converting powers were enabling me beyond my previous natural capacities to be what my son needed me to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have learned that life isn&rsquo;t as mysterious and random as I worried as a youth.&nbsp; Instead, I have found that the Lord is willing to lead me along, line upon line, grace for grace.&nbsp; How exciting the gospel of Jesus Christ is!&nbsp; There is a perfect brightness of hope for me and for you because of the redeeming and refining gospel principles and ordinances, directed so lovingly and individually by our Lord who holds the divine authoring and finishing powers (see Hebrews 12:2; Moroni 6:4).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gospel of Jesus Christ affirms that matter what we have done in our past &ndash; what ungodly and unworthy things we have recorded in us through our weakness and sin, the Lord desires us to come unto Him now and be converted that he may heal us and fashion us after his own perfect image.&nbsp; Pres. Dieter F. Uchtdorf from our general conference last April beautifully invites each of us to know that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step on the path of discipleship begins, luckily enough, in the exact place where we stand! We do not have to prequalify to take that first step. (Pres. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, &ldquo;The Way of the Disciple,&rdquo; <em>General Conference</em>, April 2009)</p>

<p>To stand at this pulpit in the presence of such a concentration of devoted, righteous graduates, parents, and loved ones is to be filled with gratitude and appreciation. I am deeply moved as I contemplate what can occur in the coming years from what you graduates will do with what you have learned at this unique university. You have the potential for making critically important contributions throughout the world. You can form eternal families, orient and raise righteous children, strengthen a host of professions, give caring service, and be a potent force for good in a world that desperately needs it. You can share the message of the Restoration by precept and example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With profound feelings of thankfulness I warmly greet each one of you we honor at this commencement service. Each has met the lofty standards of personal worthiness and academic achievement to qualify to be at the Brigham Young University in Idaho. You have kept strict standards of righteousness. Through many long, arduous days and nights of devoted study, exacting testing, and other rigorous qualifying effort, you have well earned the degree that will be conferred. You have not only attained an outstanding secular education, but you have done it while meeting the highest standards of integrity and spirituality. I am truly humbled to be in your presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are unique among graduating students in the world for having been schooled in this Church university. Therefore, we expect of you future accomplishments far beyond those asked of a graduating class elsewhere. We are extremely proud of you. Your presence here indicates you are a singular man or woman of great value and potential. You have found among your fellow students enduring friendships with others of noble characteristics similar to yours. Your preparation here has provided an exceptional foundation for you to accomplish worthwhile ambitions and realize much good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of you have been supported by noble parents and family and some by a loving spouse. You have been encouraged by a most competent faculty where individual instructors have become impressive sources of professional knowledge as well as worthy role models. Often the devoted staff has eased the way through the bewildering challenges of a college education. All of this activity at BYU&mdash;Idaho has been guided by an exceptionally gifted university president, Kim Clark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will use an example familiar to each of you to emphasize the importance of what is now occurring in your life and how to benefit the most from it. Consider the impressive launching of a spacecraft. This is the culmination of a tremendous combined effort of planning, training and hard work. It is likewise the beginning of a journey that will place its astronaut crew at their destination where they will fulfill their worthwhile assignments. When the mission is completed the spacecraft will facilitate their return with honor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An enormous structure, called the gantry crane, supports and aligns the rocket. It provides essential functions as the rocket is prepared to begin its path into space. A vital umbilical cable connects the rocket to the control center and monitors the readiness of critical systems and performs functions essential to the safe launching of the astronaut into the desired orbit. As the countdown proceeds, fueling is completed, support systems are checked out, and the operational condition of every significant system is carefully verified. As the moment of launch approaches, the gantry crane is moved aside, the umbilical cord disconnected, so that, at launch, the pilot is virtually in complete control of his destiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent weeks you have been experiencing a similar countdown to a very real launching into the orbit of life, where you have substantially increased control of your destiny. Your parents, loved ones, university professors and priesthood leaders have performed support functions similar to those of the gantry crane. For the obedient, the Holy Spirit has provided direction from the Lord as from a divine control center. With this commencement program, you are launched into the trajectory of life. You have increased freedom as well as increased responsibility for your decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider an astronaut programmed for a launching to the moon to accomplish a vital mission there. What would you think if, as he begins his journey impressed by his personal control of the power of the gigantic rocket that propels him into space, were he to radio to earth saying: "I am in command now. I don't want to listen to anymore of your directions. I am going to do what I please. By the way, I'm not going to the moon, I'm going to Mars." Certainly that decision if not rectified, would prove fatal. All his preparation and training together with the tremendous direction and support of others would be wasted unless he follows the trajectory for which he has been prepared. Be certain that the freedom of choice you now have is used wisely, productively by continuing to live righteously to enjoy the guidance of the Holy Spirit to achieve your worthy goals in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early days of the space program, skeptics often criticized the plans to place a man on the moon by observing that no matter how carefully executed the launching, the smallest deviation from the true path would cause the astronaut to miss the target by enormous distances. The project engineers responded that the astronaut would be given the ability to detect even the smallest deviation from the true course as well as the power to take corrective actions to return to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Father in Heaven has given you incomparably powerful gifts of discernment. Our Father&rsquo;s plan of salvation marks the trajectory to growth, fulfillment and happiness in life. As a worthy member of His Church, you have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. I testify, therefore, that you can be inspired to know what to do in every important-phase of personal and professional life. Moreover, I know that you can receive power from God to expand your faculties and strength to accomplish His inspired will. I have repeatedly enjoyed such blessings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may remember, that on one occasion, the crew of a spacecraft in return flight toward earth encountered a severe challenge. They had extended solar panels to convert energy from the sun into electrical power needed for the re-entry. This equipment jammed as they tried to store it. They realized that unless the panels could be retracted, the resistance they would create in the earth's atmosphere at reentry would cause their capsule to veer out of control and be destroyed. Unable to correct the situation themselves, they communicated with the control center. Through the night, design engineers labored with similar equipment until the cause of the malfunction was identified and a corrective procedure developed. This information was communicated by radio to the astronauts. Their obedient compliance to these instructions corrected the error and saved their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you use the newly acquired freedoms that begin this day, you will likewise encounter challenges in your life that will test severely your strength and ability. You will find that the education you have received at this campus will provide great capacity to resolve some challenges. You will confirm that your education is a key to help you open the doors of opportunity. You will likewise prove that it is not, however, a guarantee for success. It must be coupled with hard work, consistency and, above all, inspiration and power from a loving Heavenly Father. Like the astronauts, you will find some challenges that can only be resolved by communication with Him and by being sensitive to the impressions that come as a result. Faithful obedience to those spiritual promptings will protect, guide, motivate, strengthen, and crown your efforts. You will find success, joy, and happiness for yourselves and great blessings for those whom you serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I close with a few concrete suggestions for you who graduate today. They are simple yet profound. They are drawn from the doctrine of the Lord and personal experience that has brought happiness and success to my dear wife, Jeanene, and to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use Correct Principles</strong>. From the teachings of Jesus Christ, establish a set of guiding principles for your life, and never compromise them. Difficulties in life begin when small deviations from true standards are made to justify a quick move to a greater accomplishment. Over time, that pattern brings failure. Strength comes from making no exceptions to foundation principles. Without such guidelines, an individual lives for the moment, making decisions according to current circumstances. Such an one is doomed to violate eternal truths and lose by rationalization many of the marvelous opportunities of life that bring great achievement and happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Faith in Jesus Christ.</strong> It is understandable that you feel some anxiety about your future. Because you are exceptional young men and women the Lord will accelerate your growth by giving you experiences that will stretch your current capacity to the limit. Let your predominant attitude be faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, confidence in His teachings, trust in His ability to keep His promises and reliance on His capacity to inspire, motivate, and guide you. Stay close to Him through faith and obedience. Then, through the Holy Ghost, He will help you find the solution to every perplexing problem you will face. The answers to major challenges will likely come after considerable prayer and pondering. Usually, portions of the answer will be given a piece at a time until the full answer is received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Have an attitude of continuing happiness.</strong> The challenges you face, the growth experiences you encounter, should be like temporary scenes played out on the stage of continuing peace and happiness. Don&rsquo;t become so absorbed in a single event that you can&rsquo;t think of anything else. Challenges are not intended to be the substance of life. It is by understanding and the teachings of God that your life will fulfill its glorious purpose. That perspective keeps challenges confined to their proper place&mdash;stepping stones to further growth and attainment. Life should be wondrously beautiful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Establish a home and family.</strong> Make your home a haven of peace free of conflict and dissention. It is in your own home where the gospel is most effectively taught and lived. Make the place where you live, no matter how humble or temporary, the embodiment of a clean and righteous environment where the Spirit can dwell and guide you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make one of the highest priorities of life the formation of an eternal family. Then live to permit the Lord to guide you to that objective while accepting His timing. Some of you have begun to reach that sacred objective as wife and husband. Others are in the process of finding that special eternal companion. Some of you may have feelings that you will not have such a blessing. Do not cheat yourself that way. Decide now to live to be led to an eternal companion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trust in the Lord.</strong> Be obedient to His counsel. Follow His commandments, and you will be filled with inspiration and power. You will obtain goals beyond your personal capacity. Do not judge your potential by what you are today, but by what you can become under the guidance of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Material things do not of themselves produce happiness and satisfaction and the joy of attainment on earth. Nor do they lead us to exaltation. It is nobility of character, that fabric of inner strength and conviction woven from countless righteous decisions, none of which is difficult to make, that gives life its direction. A consistent righteous life produces an inner power and strength that can be permanently resistant to the eroding influence of sin and transgression. Your faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments will strengthen your character. Your character is a measure of what you are becoming. It is the evidence of how well you are using your time on earth in this period of mortal probation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be honest and loyal.</strong> Keep your word and keep your commitments. If your responsibility is to provide an income for a family, acquire work with good leadership in a field that really matters. Give more than is expected. With your background from this university, minimum or average work is not acceptable. Admit mistakes when you make them, for we all do. That act builds character and also respect. Accept full responsibility for your actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Live so as to be trusted.</strong> Trust opens wide the gate to exceptional opportunity and success. Seek to be challenged in what you do. Don&rsquo;t look for a safe haven where you have no risk, for you will not grow nor have real satisfaction. Do not compartmentalize your life into segments that apply to profession, Church, and family with different standards for each segment, as is done in the world. Live uniform high standards of truth, integrity, and hard work. That pattern will bring success in every aspect of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow Proper Traditions.</strong> Some traditions fortify families others severely challenge them. Let the traditions you make part of your home bring blessings by making your first priority your membership in the Church of Jesus Christ and His teachings the foundation of your life. Where family or national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God throw them away. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, cherish and follow them to preserve your culture and heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Smile.</strong> Everyone has problems, but nobody wants to know about yours. Smile a lot. It&rsquo;s a beautiful way to let sunshine into your life and to spread it to the joy and benefit of others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t complain.</strong> There will be times when life just isn&rsquo;t fair. Some others may make unfair decisions that affect you professionally or otherwise. Don&rsquo;t waste time complaining. Life is charged with opportunity when you seek the help of the Lord to find it. Look for the gold nuggets of opportunity around you, mine them, and use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve others.</strong> Immense happiness comes from serving others selflessly. Always have a Church assignment. Always. Don&rsquo;t request specific callings but ask to be used so that you are constantly connected to the reality of eternal truth. That effort will keep your life in balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express Gratitude.</strong> The Lord has declared</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments&rdquo; (D&amp;C 59:21).</em></p>
<p>Give thanks for the Atonement. Peace and happiness are the precious fruits of a righteous life. They are only possible because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that with unimaginable suffering and agony at an incalculable price, the Savior earned His right to be our Intermediary, our Redeemer, our Final Judge. Through faith in Him and receipt of the required ordinances and covenants you can earn your right to the blessings of eternal marriage made possible through His Infinite Atonement and qualify through continuing obedience for the glorious privilege of eternal life in the Celestial Kingdom with qualified loved ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today as you commence the balance of your life, recognize that the Lord has placed divine influence in your life that will lead you along the individual plan He would have you fulfill here on earth. Through much prayer and pondering seek through the Spirit to identify and carefully follow that influence. It is most easily identified by humbly seeking the will of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spoken from my heart because of the appreciation and love I have for each one of you. My desire is that the counsel given will not only benefit you who graduate, but you who continue your education at this exceptional university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I invoke a blessing upon each one of you, conditioned on your faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments, that the Lord will guide you through the Holy Ghost to make the correct choices in important decisions you now face, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
