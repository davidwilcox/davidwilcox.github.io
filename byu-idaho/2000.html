<p><font color="#000080">Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. To both 		new and returning students, welcome to Ricks College. Sister Bednar and 		I are delighted you are here, and we look forward to meeting and 		visiting and serving with you in the weeks and months ahead.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to be with 		us this afternoonthat together we may understand both the content and 		intent of the message I hope to communicate. The topic of my message is 		important, it is serious, and it is sensitive; and I cannot recall a 		time when I have yearned for the assistance of the Spirit of the Lord 		more than I do today. I also need and ask for your help. I need your 		earnest attention as well as your faith and prayers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In family home evening lessons, Primary 		classes, Sunday School lessons, and Young Women and priesthood classes, 		we have all learned about the fundamental purposes of our mortal 		existence. If you or I were asked the question, &quot;<i>Why are we here on 		the earth</i>?&quot; I believe each and every one of us would give basically 		the same answer: &quot;<i>to receive a physical body, to live by faith rather 		than sight, and to be tested.</i>&quot; As the Proclamation on the Family 		explains, we as spirit sons and daughters of our Eternal Father &quot;. . .		<i>accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body 		and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately 		realize [our] divine destiny as . . . heir[s] of eternal life.</i>&quot; 		These answers are profound in both their power and in their simplicity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Today I invite you to consider with me one 		particular element of these answers. Have we ever really considered why 		having a physical body is so important? Now I know we can all say the 		right words when answering the question about why we are here on the 		earth, but do we really understand why a body is so central to the 		Fathers plan of happiness? Do we perhaps recite this answer so 		frequently and routinely that we fail to recognize its true importance? 		I would like for us this afternoon to dig a bit deeper into this 		eternally important question about why a body is so important. 		Ultimately the answer to this question affects everything we dowhat we 		think, how we act, where we go, what we eat, what we drink, and what we 		wear and how we look.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught with great 		clarity about the importance of our physical bodies:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We came to this earth that we might 				have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial 				kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a 				body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is 				pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man, and when cast 				out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine, showing 				that he would prefer a swine's body to having none.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">All beings who have bodies have power 				over those who have not. The devil has no power over us only as 				we permit him. The moment we revolt at anything which comes from 				God, the devil takes power.</font> <br />(<i> </i> <font color="#000080"><u>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, 				Section Four 183942, p. 181)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, I do not claim to know the complete answer 		to the question of why a physical body is so important. But let me share 		with you a few basic reasons why a body is essential to our spiritual 		development and our eternal progression.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i><b><u>Reason #1</u>.</b></i> Obtaining a 		tabernacle of flesh is an essential step in the process of becoming like 		our Heavenly Father. Our physical bodies make possible a breadth and a 		depth and an intensity of experience that simply could not be obtained 		in our premortal estate. As President Boyd K. Packer has taught, &quot;<i>Our 		physical body is the instrument of our spirit</i>&quot; (<font color="#000080"><u>Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled</u>, p. 211). Thus, our 		relationships with other people, our capacity to recognize and respond 		to truth, and our ability to obey the principles and ordinances of the 		gospel of Jesus Christ are amplified through our physical bodies. In 		this classroom of mortality we experience tenderness, kindness, 		happiness, sorrow, disappointment, pain, and even the challenges of 		physical limitations in ways that prepare us for eternity. Simply 		stated, there are lessons we must learn and experiences we must have, as 		the scriptures describe, &quot;<i>according to the flesh</i> . . .&quot; (1 Nephi 		19:6; Alma 7:12-13).</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><u><i><b>Reason #2</b></i></u>. Our Heavenly 		Father and His Beloved Son are, by nature, creators. As the sons and 		daughters of God, we have the potential to become like them. The Father 		and the Son have entrusted us with a portion of their creative power and 		provided specific guidelines for the proper use of that sacred ability 		to create life and establish an eternal family. How we feel about and 		use that sacred power in this life, in large measure, will determine 		whether additional creative power will be ours in the life to come.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><u><i><b>Reason #3</b></i></u>. As we attempt 		to answer the question about why we are here on the earth, we usually 		consider &quot;<i>receiving a physical body</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>being tested</i>&quot; as 		two related but separate parts of the answer. However, an essential part 		of the test of mortality is having and properly using a physical body. 		Please listen carefully to the following statement by President Brigham 		Young:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You are aware that many think that the 				Devil has rule and power over both body and spirit. Now, I want 				to tell you that he does not hold any power over man, only so 				far as the body overcomes the spirit that is in a man, through 				yielding to the spirit of evil. The spirit that the Lord puts 				into a tabernacle of flesh, is under the dictation of the Lord 				Almighty; but the spirit and body are united in order that the 				spirit may have a tabernacle, and be exalted; and the spirit is 				influenced by the body, and the body by the spirit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the first place the spirit is pure, 				and under the special control and influence of the Lord, but the 				body is of the earth, and is subject to the power of the Devil, 				and is under the mighty influence of that fallen nature that is 				of the earth. If the spirit yields to the body, the Devil then 				has power to overcome the body and spirit of that man, and he 				loses both.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Recollect, brethren and sisters, every 				one of you, that when evil is suggested to you, when it arises 				in your hearts, it is through the temporal organization. When 				you are tempted, buffeted, and step out of the way 				inadvertently; when you are overtaken in a fault, or commit an 				overt act unthinkingly; when you are full of evil passion, and 				wish to yield to it, then stop and let the spirit, which God has 				put into your tabernacles, take the lead. If you do that, I will 				promise that you will overcome all evil, and obtain eternal 				lives. But many, very many, let the spirit yield to the body, 				and are overcome and destroyed. </font>(<font color="#000080"><u>Discourses 				of Brigham Young</u>, p. 69-70)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, please turn with me to 2 Nephi chapter 2 		and follow along as I read verses 26 through 29.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And the Messiah cometh in the fullness 				of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. 				And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have 				become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for 				themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the 				punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to 				the commandments which God hath given.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Wherefore, men are free according to 				the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient 				unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, 				through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity 				and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; <b>				for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto 				himself.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And now, my sons, I would that ye 				should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great 				commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal 				life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And not choose eternal death, <b>				according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein</b>, 				which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to 				bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own 				kingdom</font> <font color="#000080">(emphasis added).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now brothers and sisters, the statement of 		Brigham Young and these verses from 2&nbsp;Nephi must be studied thoroughly 		and pondered prayerfully. Neither the statement by President Young nor 		the scriptures we just read assert that the physical body is inherently 		evil. Rather, we live in a fallen world. The very elements out of which 		our bodies were created are by nature fallen and ever subject to the 		pull of sin, corruption, and death. Thus, the Fall of Adam and its 		consequences affect us most directly through our physical bodies. And 		yet as President Young stated, we are dual creatures, for at the same 		time that we inhabit a physical body that is subject to the Fall, we 		also have a spirit that represents the eternal part of us; we are the 		spirit sons and daughters of God and have inherited divine qualities 		from Him. The precise nature of the test of mortality, then, can be 		summarized in the following questions: Will my body rule over my spirit, 		or will my spirit rule over my body? Will I yield to the enticings of 		the natural man or to the eternal man? That, brothers and sisters, is 		the test. We are here on the earth to develop godlike qualities and to 		learn to bridle all of the passions of the flesh (Alma 38:12).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Principle: Our Bodies Are Not Our Own</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I now want to try and explain a principle that 		is fundamental to our knowledge about and understanding of the 		importance of a physical body. The principle is this: Our bodies are not 		our own. Please turn with me in the New Testament to 1 Corinthians 		6:19-20.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What? Know ye not that your body is the 				temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, 				and ye are not your own?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">For ye are bought with a price: 				therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which 				are Gods.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">King Benjamin also taught with great clarity 		the truth that our bodies ultimately are not our own. Please turn with 		me in the Book of Mormon to Mosiah 2:23-25. In this chapter King 		Benjamin describes how we are blessed through service and indebted to 		our God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And now, in the first place, he hath 				created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are 				indebted to him.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And secondly, he doth require that ye 				should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth 				immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye 				are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and 				ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And now I ask, can ye say aught of 				yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as 				much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust 				of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Both our agency and our physical body, through 		which we exercise that agency in mortality, are truly &quot;<i>bought with a 		price</i>&quot; through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We are called to be, 		as the Apostle Peter wrote, &quot;<i>. . . a royal priesthood, an holy 		nation, a peculiar people . . .</i>&quot; (1 Peter 2:9). To be sure, we 		should be peculiar in the sense that we are distinctive, set apart from, 		and uncontrolled by the world. In addition, we are peculiar in a more 		powerful sense. As the Greek word implies, we are peculiar in that we 		are a <i><b>purchased</b></i> people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Interestingly, I have heard many young people, 		both outside and inside of the Church, declare, &quot;<i>Its my body and I 		can do to it what I want.</i>&quot; The correct doctrinal response to such a 		statement is quite simple. No, your body is not your own; it is a loaner 		from God. As we read in 1 Corinthians 3:16-17:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Know ye not that ye are the temple of 				God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If any man defile the temple of God, 				him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which 				temple ye are.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And the choices we make about the use of our 		personal temples will affect us throughout all eternity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Because the physical body is so central to the 		Fathers plan of happiness and our spiritual development, we should not 		be surprised that Lucifer seeks to thwart our progression by enticing us 		to use our bodies improperly. It is to me one of the ultimate ironies of 		eternity that the adversary who is miserable precisely because he has no 		physical body, and therefore cannot progress, seeks to make us miserable		<i>&quot;. . . like unto himself . . .</i>&quot; (2 Nephi 2:28) through the 		improper use of our bodies. The very tool he does not have and cannot 		use thus is the primary instrument through which he attempts to lure us 		to spiritual destruction. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our physical bodies indeed are temples of God. 		Consequently, brothers and sisters, you and I must carefully consider 		what we take <i><b>into</b></i> our temple, what we put <i><b>on</b></i> 		our temple, what we do <i><b>to</b></i> our temple, and what we do <i> <b>with</b></i> our temple. And we can learn a number of important 		lessons by comparing the Churchs temples to our physical bodies as 		temples.</font></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What We Take <u><i>Into </i></u>Our Temple</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A member of the Church who desires to enter a 		dedicated temple must be worthy to do so. The requirement of worthiness 		for all who enter the House of the Lord preserves the sacred nature of 		these special buildings and permits the ongoing presence of the Lords 		spirit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now please consider the importance of 		worthiness to enter the House of the Lord as we review the following 		counsel from President Boyd K. Packer:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our physical body is the instrument of 				our spirit. In that marvelous revelation the Word of Wisdom we 				are told how to keep our bodies free from impurities which might 				dull, even destroy, those delicate physical senses which have to 				do with spiritual communication.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Word of Wisdom is a key to 				individual revelation. It was given as &quot;a principle with 				promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of 				all saints&quot; (D&amp;C 89:3).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The promise is that those who obey will 				receive &quot;great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures&quot; 				(v. 19). If we abuse our body with habit-forming substances, or 				misuse prescription drugs, we draw curtains which close off the 				light of spiritual communication. </font>(<font color="#000080"><u>Let 				Not Your Heart Be Troubled</u>, p.&nbsp;211-212)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The primary blessing that comes from obedience 		to the Word of Wisdom is spiritual in nature, not necessarily physical. 		Certainly, we all recognize the physical benefits of adhering to the 		lifestyle and dietary guidelines contained in the Word of Wisdom. But 		please notice how President Packer emphasized the link between what we 		take into our bodies and our ability to receive spiritual communication. 		The Word of Wisdom is about readiness and receptiveness to receive 		revelation. And secondarily the Word of Wisdom also produces physical 		benefits. Just as only worthy persons are permitted to enter into the 		House of the Lord, so we should likewise be careful to take into our 		bodies only those things that will positively affect us both spiritually 		and physically.</font></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What We Put <u><i>On </i></u>Our Temple</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Churchs temples are recognized throughout 		the world for their beauty. The buildings themselves are made of the 		finest materials and constructed with true craftsmanship. And the areas 		immediately surrounding a temple always are neat, orderly, and 		well-groomed and maintained. Please consider the impact of the 		appearance of a temple and its grounds as we now review the following 		counsel from President Harold B. Lee:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do not underestimate the important 				symbolic and actual effect of appearance. Persons who are well 				groomed and modestly dressed invite the companionship of the 				Spirit of our Father in Heaven and are able to exercise a 				wholesome influence upon those around them. Persons who are 				unkempt and careless about their appearance, or adopt the visual 				symbols of those who often oppose our ideals, expose themselves 				and persons around them to influences that are degrading and 				dissonant. Outward appearance is often a reflection of inward 				tendencies.</font> (<font color="#000080"><u>The Teachings 				of Harold B. Lee</u>, p. 219-220)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Just as the Churchs temples portray light and 		an inner beauty through their outward appearance, so we must be 		thoughtful and careful about how we dress and what we put on our 		personal temples. Full-time missionaries have a distinctive style of 		dress that differentiates them from the world and is intended, in part, 		as an outward manifestation of their discipleship. It would never be 		appropriate for the appearance or the demeanor of these special 		messengers to in any way detract from the sacred message they are called 		to deliver. Full-time members should be no less distinctive. Like it or 		not, other people make judgments about the restored gospel by what they 		see or feel in you and me. One of the most tragic lines in scripture was 		spoken by Alma to his errant son, Corianton: &quot;. . . <i>Behold, O my son, 		how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your 		conduct they would not believe in my words</i>&quot; (Alma 39:11). In 		appearance and demeanor, defenders of the faith should not seek to 		emulate or imitate offenders of the faith.</font></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What We Do <u><i>To </i></u>Our Temple</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Imagine the reaction you or I might have if we 		saw defacing graffiti on the exterior of one of our Churchs temples. 		The very thought of finding such inappropriate markings on a temple is 		offensive and repulsive to all of us. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, we must be particularly 		careful as the fads and fashions of the world entice us to mark or to 		pierce or to otherwise deface or disfigure our personal temples. 		Consider the following counsel from President Spencer W. Kimball:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How far, we wonder, will men and women 				go to pay ovations to the god of style? Will men wear rings in 				their noses when style dictates? Will young people still fall 				prey to their god of style, which they worship?</font> (<font color="#000080"><u>Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</u>, p. 380)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">That comment by President Kimball was made 26 		years ago, and I wonder what he would think if he were alive today. We 		now live in a world where people routinely do wear rings and other items 		in their noses, in their tongues, in their navels, and in their eyebrows 		because that is the current fad and the style. President Kimballs 		question is still valid for us today. &quot;<i>How far, we wonder, will men 		and women go to pay ovations to the god of style</i>?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is interesting to me that these fashions and 		trends of the world frequently promote a false individuality that is 		nothing more than a shallow, superficial, and curious outward 		conformity. True individuality is the product of spirituality and is not 		a function of trinkets or ornaments attached to or hanging from parts of 		our body. The spiritual basis of individuality is never more evident to 		me than when I worship in the House of the Lord, and everyone is dressed 		in similar white clothing and looks essentially the same. In that 		setting, no fads or fashion statements are necessary. The unity and 		outward sameness of appearance in the temple permits the individual 		spirit to shine through. That, brothers and sisters, is the only type of 		individuality that really matters. Remember, our bodies are not our own; 		they are loaners from God. Indeed, they are temples and the Spirit of 		the Lord should dwell therein and shine through. And, may I quickly add, 		it is impossible for the Spirit to shine in and through our physical 		bodies when we are dozy and dull from foolishly going to bed at 		1:30&nbsp;a.m. or 2:30 a.m. or later night after night after night (see D&amp;C 		88:124).</font></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What We Do <u><i>With</i></u> Our Temple</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The temples of our Church are built and 		dedicated to accomplish righteous purposes. Sacred ordinances, including 		the endowment and eternal marriage, are available only in the Lords 		House. You and I are fortunate to live at a time when temple 		construction rapidly is accelerating around the world; many members who 		previously had great difficulty receiving temple blessings can now do so 		much nearer to their own homes and communities. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please consider the sacred ordinances offered 		and righteous purposes accomplished in the Churchs temples as we review 		the following teachings by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the 		Twelve Apostles:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the &quot;plain and precious&quot; truths 				restored in this dispensation is that &quot;the spirit and the body 				are the soul of man&quot; (D&amp;C 88:15)<i> and that when the spirit 				and body are separated, men and women &quot;cannot receive a fullness 				of joy&quot; </i>(D&amp;C 93:34)<i>. That is the reason why obtaining a 				body is so fundamentally important in the first place, why sin 				of any kind is such a serious matter (namely because it is sin 				that ultimately brings both physical and spiritual death), and 				why the resurrection of the body is so central to the great 				triumph of Christ's Atonement. </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The body is an essential part of the 				soul. This distinctive and very important Latter-day Saint 				doctrine underscores why sexual sin is so serious. We declare 				that one who uses the God-given body of another without divine 				sanction abuses the very soul of that individual, abuses the 				central purpose and processes of life, &quot;the very key&quot;</font> 				(<font color="#000080">In <u>Conference Report</u>, Apr. 1972, 				p. 139; or <u>Ensign</u>, July 1972, p.&nbsp;113)<i> to life, as 				President Boyd K. Packer once called it. In exploiting the body 				of anotherwhich means exploiting his or her soulone desecrates 				the Atonement of Christ, which saved that soul and which makes 				possible the gift of eternal life. And when one mocks the Son of 				Righteousness, one steps into a realm of heat hotter and holier 				than the noonday sun. You cannot do so and not be burned.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please, never say: &quot;Who does it hurt? 				Why not a little freedom? I can transgress now and repent 				later.&quot; Please don't be so foolish or so cruel. You cannot with 				impunity &quot;crucify Christ afresh&quot;</font> (<font color="#000080">See Heb. 6:6<i>). &quot;Flee fornication,&quot; Paul cries, </i>				(1 Cor. 6:18)<i> and flee &quot;anything like unto it,&quot; (</i>D&amp;C&nbsp;59:6)<i> 				the Doctrine and Covenants adds. Why? Well, for one reason 				because of the incalculable suffering in both body and spirit 				endured by the Savior of the world so that we could flee (see 				especially </i>D&amp;C 19:15-20<i>). We owe Him something for that. 				Indeed, we owe Him everything. &quot;Ye are not your own,&quot; Paul says. 				&quot;Ye [have been] bought with a price: therefore glorify God in 				your body, and in your spirit, which are God's&quot; (</i>1 Cor. 				6:19-20; see also verses 13-18)<i>. In sexual transgression the 				soul is at stakethe body and the spirit. (</i><u>Conference 				Report</u>, October 1998, p. 99-100<i>)</i></font></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, both the Churchs temples and our personal 		temples must be used to accomplish the righteous purposes for which they 		were created. Our physical body is a marvelous blessing and a timeless 		trust. The most sacred of all our divine powers is to become a 		co-creator with Heavenly Father in providing physical bodies for His 		spirit sons and daughters and in establishing a righteous and 		Christ-centered family. Nothing is more holy; nothing deserves more 		reverence; nothing is more central to the plan of happiness. And our 		very souls are at stake.</p>
<p>Now, lets return to where we began this afternoon. If you or I were 		asked the question, &quot;<i>Why are we here on the earth,&quot; I believe each 		and every one of us would give basically the same answer: &quot;to receive a 		physical body, to live by faith rather than sight, and to be tested.&quot; I 		hope we now better understand why &quot;to receive a physical body&quot; is the 		first element of the answer to this important question.</i></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the doctrines Lucifer works most diligently to 		distort and attack are the ones that really matter the most to us 		individually, to our families, and to the world. Please consider what we 		have discussed today. The great plan of happiness requires that each of 		us obtain a physical body and makes possible a forever family. Consider 		the popular philosophy that many voices in our modern world would 		persuade us to believe: &quot;. . . Eat, drink, and be merry, nevertheless, 		fear Godhe will justify in committing a little sin; . . .&quot; (2&nbsp;Nephi 		28:8). Such an ideology is a lie inspired by the great deceiver. Where 		is the adversary presently directing his most direct and diabolical 		attacks? Upon our beliefs about and uses of the physical body and upon 		the family. Remember, Satan does not have a body and he cannot have a 		family. He desires that all of us would become miserable like unto 		himself. And the adversary relentlessly works to distort the two 		doctrines he hates the most.</p>
<p>I conclude with the following statement by Elder Melvin J. Ballard, a 		member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the early 1900s:</p>
<p>The body that has been given to us was for the purpose of 				allowing the spirit to exalt itself to a nobler condition. The 				lightning that is seen flashing from cloud to cloud, from 				mountain top to mountain top, is an electrical force that may 				tear down buildings, set fire to property, and destroy life. 				Conduct electricity through the dynamo wire, and motor, and 				behold its wonderful results working for the service of man, 				accomplishing something under the control of a physical 				instrument, it thus becomes a power for good. So with steam, if 				allowed to evaporate freely it does little good, but restrain it 				in the boiler, send it through the engine, and under its power 				you may travel across the continent or sail from shore to shore. 				And so, too, with this highest, most potent of all spiritual 				forces, the intelligence that is in man: enshrine it in a 				spiritual body, that it may have the experiences of spiritual 				life; and then give it a physical body, that it may enter into 				and obtain the joy and experiences of physical life, and you 				have enlarged its powers immeasurably.

<p>I testify we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. His 		plan for our eternal progression is perfect. I witness that the Only 		Begotten Son of the Father offered himself as the infinite atoning 		sacrifice required by the plan. I know the Savior lives, and He directs 		the affairs of His living Church through living apostles and prophets. I 		so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><font color="#004040">Brothers and sisters, it is a privilege to be here with you this
    morning.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">My desire today is to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
    It is not my intent to give a lecture nor to give a talk; rather, I hope to share with you
    some things from my own personal study of the Book of Mormon. I will describe both a
    method of study that I frequently use and some of the results the method produces.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Let me begin with a recommendation. Please do not write down
    anything I say today. Let me explain why. The eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants
    is a revelation given to Oliver Cowdery through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In that section
    we learn very specifically about the spiritual gift of revelation. We learn that most
    typically the gift of revelation comes as thoughts to the mind and feelings to the heart.
    I suggest you have a pencil or a pen and a piece of paper, and I hope you have your
    scriptures on your lap and are ready to use them. But what you and I should really pay
    attention to this morning is certainly not what I will say but the thoughts and feelings
    that will come in this very special setting. We are meeting in a dedicated chapel; we are
    members of the Church who have made sacred covenants; we have sung a hymn of Zion; we have
    united in prayer; and, as we continue to pray for each other&#151;even as I now pray for
    you and you continue to pray for me&#151; that we will have the Holy Ghost and its
    influence here, there will come to you and to me inspired thoughts and feelings. They will
    be placed in our minds and in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. And that is what we should pay
    attention to today, not what I will say. If you will consider this principle and the
    recommendation about how the spirit of revelation works, then indeed we will have an
    edifying and uplifting experience together.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Before beginning, however, I need to make a brief comment to
    those who will read this message from a hard copy without having first heard it at the
    symposium. During my presentation, I will use both slides and a series of animations to
    illustrate and summarize key points. While the PowerPoint slides have been printed and
    attached to this copy (noted throughout the text), I anticipate the full impact of the
    message will be somewhat diminished in text form when compared to the initial oral and
    visual presentation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">I want to begin with my testimony of the Book of Mormon. I will
    end with my testimony as well, but I want to begin by declaring that I love the Book of
    Mormon. I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God and want to take just a minute or two
    to describe a personal experience that relates to my testimony of the Book of Mormon. I
    know by the witness of the Spirit and by personal experience that the Book of Mormon is
    true.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Before coming to Ricks College, I was a business professor for
    almost 20 years. As a part of my work, I wrote books. I brought with me today one of the
    books I authored with a colleague when I was a faculty member at the University of
    Arkansas. This book is 650 pages long, it contains 17 chapters, and it took us two years
    to write. The colleague with whom I wrote this book also has a Ph.D., which means that we
    each went to college for eight years or more--a total of more than 16 years of formal
    higher education between the two of us. It is a remarkable experience to receive a box of
    these brand-new books from the publisher. I was seated in my office at Texas Tech
    University when my box of books arrived. I opened up the box and thumbed through one of
    the books. As I did so, I looked out the window of my office and asked myself the
    question, &quot;Why did you write this book?&quot; When you really think about it,
    investing so much time and effort in a project that so quickly becomes obsolete is rather
    foolish. As I posed that question to myself and as I was pondering, the thought came to
    me, &quot;Because now you know by experience that Joseph Smith could not have written the
    Book of Mormon.&quot; That conclusion clearly was influenced by the fact that for all of
    my professional career we lived in Arkansas and Texas. We, as members of The Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, were the religious minority in the middle of the Bible
    Belt. We relentlessly were confronted by people of other faiths who said, &quot;The Book
    of Mormon is not necessary; the Bible is all that you need. And Joseph Smith wrote the
    Book of Mormon.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">With eight years of university training, with two years of very
    dedicated work, with an editorial staff, with personal computers, with spell checkers and
    thesauruses on-line, with the Internet and the other resources that are so readily
    available, when I picked up the book that I had written and opened it up, I still found
    mistakes. And within a matter of twelve months, this book upon which I had worked so hard
    and so long was obsolete and had to be revised.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Brothers and sisters, you could take a team of the brightest
    people on the earth, as large a team as you might want, with all of the support staff, all
    of the computer technology, and all of the assistance that you can imagine, and such a
    team could not produce one page of a Book of Mormon. Consider the power of the following
    phrases: <em>&quot;. . . men are that they might have joy&quot;</em> (2&nbsp;Nephi 2:25); <em>&quot;.
    . . wickedness never was happiness&quot;</em> (Alma 41:10); and <em>&quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;press
    forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope&quot;</em>
    (2&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;31:20). We could go on for a long, long time quoting simple but
    powerful phrases that no one could have generated without divine assistance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">The best summary I have ever found about the Book of Mormon is
    from George Cannon, the father of George Q. Cannon. This is what he said, &quot;No wicked
    man could write such a book as this, and no good man would write it unless it were true
    and he were commanded of God to do so&quot; (LDS Biographical Encyclopedia, Andrew Jenson,
    Vol. 1, pg.&nbsp;42).</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Well, brothers and sisters, intellectually I know the Book of
    Mormon is true; and I know it through personal experience as an author. And that type of
    knowledge is nice. But what is most important is the witness of the Spirit. And I know by
    the witness of the Spirit, I know intellectually, and I know as an author and by personal
    experience that Joseph Smith could not and did not write the Book of Mormon.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now I want to describe a method of scripture study. What I
    frequently do as I study the scriptures is search for phrases. A specific scriptural
    phrase is the topic that I am going to be discussing with you this morning. The Book of
    Mormon contains a promise, it contains a warning, and it contains an invitation. The
    promise is that if we are obedient, we will prosper in the land. The warning is to avoid
    pride and blindness in our minds and hardheartedness in our hearts. And the invitation is
    to come unto Christ. That is the phrase that I will focus on today--the invitation to
    </font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">If I were to ask you about the mission of the Church, I hope you
    would not say it is to proclaim the gospel and redeem the dead and perfect the Saints.
    That is not the mission of the Church. The mission of the Church is to invite all to come
    unto Christ. There is a perfect alignment between the central message and the invitation
    of the Book of Mormon and the overarching mission of the Church. We perform the work of
    inviting all to come unto Christ in three major arenas. If we are inviting those who have
    not yet received the ordinance of baptism to come unto Christ, we are proclaiming the
    gospel. If we are inviting those to come unto Christ who have already received the
    ordinance of baptism, we are laboring to perfect the Saints. And if we are assisting those
    who have passed through the veil to come unto Christ, we are redeeming the dead. There is
    only one work: inviting all to come unto Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">The Book of Mormon is a handbook about that process of coming
    unto Christ. I want to emphasize that coming unto Christ is a process; it is not a single
    or discrete event. It is an ongoing, continuing process throughout our lives. That one
    principle will be a key element to what I am going to be discussing with you today.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">My goal today is that we will leave here able and motivated to
    ask better and more penetrating questions. Consequently, my remarks and my discussion with
    you today will not provide you with all of the information you need to know about the
    process of coming unto Christ. Rather, I will pose questions that we ought to pursue and
    consider. Questions are one of the most powerful teaching tools. The Savior used questions
    as one of His primary teaching tools. Perhaps, then, if we strive to ask inspired and
    effective questions, you and I can subsequently engage in the process that will help us
    find our own answer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Let me now describe what I have done. I looked in the standard
    works for all of the verses that contains the following phrases: <em>Come unto me, come
    unto Christ, come unto the Holy One of Israel, come unto God, come unto the Lord</em>. How
    many do you think there are? All together, there are 124. Let me show you a breakdown of
    those verses (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0002.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide
    2</a>). The phrase <em>come unto me</em> is found 74 times; <em>come unto
    him</em>, 24 times; <em>come unto Christ</em>, 5 times. The phrases <em>come unto the Holy
    One of Israel</em> and <em>come unto God</em> are found 11 times. Other variations of the
    word <em>come</em> are <em>cometh unto me</em> and <em>cometh unto the Lord</em>; there
    were six and four of those phrases respectively.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">It was necessary to eliminate some of the 124 verses from my
    analysis because the phrase <em>come unto me</em> is not always used in relation to the
    Savior (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0003.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 3</a>). For example, in Exodus 18:15 we find the episode wherein Jethro teaches
    Moses that it is not wise for him to have all of the people come to him for answers to
    their problems. <em>&quot;And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people <strong>come
    unto me</strong> to inquire of God&quot;</em> (emphasis added). So I took the 124 verses
    that contain the phrase <em>come unto me</em>, and I eliminated the ones like Exodus 18:15
    that refer to persons other than the Savior. Sixty-seven verses were left when I completed
    the initial analysis.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now let us look at where these 67 verses come from (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0004.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 4</a>).
    Forty-two of the verses are found in the Book of Mormon. That fact alone is very
    significant. Where do you think the majority of those verses are found within the Book of
    Mormon? Fifteen are found in 3 Nephi--a fact that should not be terribly surprising. What
    we now know is that the Book of Mormon is the handbook about how we come unto Christ, and
    the most focused instruction in the Book of Mormon about this process is found in
    3&nbsp;Nephi as the Savior appeared to and taught the people on the American continent.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now let me show you where the other verses are located
    (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0005.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide&nbsp;5</a>). Eighteen of the 67&nbsp;verses are found in the Bible. Of those verses,
    one is found in the Old Testament, ten are found in the New Testament, and seven are found
    in the Joseph Smith translation. I might point out that six of the seven found in the
    Joseph Smith translation are also in the New Testament; one of the seven is unique to the
    Joseph Smith translation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Seven of the 67 verses are found in the Doctrine and Covenants
    (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0006.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 6</a>). None are found in the Pearl of Great Price. One of the things I think will be
    quite interesting in my future study is to examine the seven verses from the Doctrine and
    Covenants and review them in their totality to see how they are different from or similar
    to the verses in the Book of Mormon or in the New Testament.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now let me describe what I did with the 67 verses that contain
    some variation of the phrase <em>come unto me</em> and are related specifically to the
    Savior (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0007.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 7</a>). While I will use the word <em>analysis</em> to describe the process I
    used, analysis is far too sophisticated of a term and suggests a level of precision <u>far
    beyond</u> anything I actually did. So please do not conclude that I used a rigorous or
    overly systematic method.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">I took the 67 verses, printed them, and cut them out one by one.
    Prior to cutting them out, I color coded the verses. I referred to a key element in the
    verse that came before the phrase <em>come unto me</em> as a <strong>preparatory condition</strong>.
    In other words, a preparatory condition was assumed to be something that one would do in
    the beginning or initial stages of this process of coming unto Christ. Everything in the
    verse that came after the phrase <em>come unto Christ</em>, I called an <strong>ongoing
    requirement</strong>. I also identified <strong>promised blessings</strong> that are
    linked to the process of coming unto Christ. Thus, I used three colors as I read each of
    the verses. If a statement were highlighted in blue and came before the phrase <em>&quot;come
    unto Christ,&quot;</em> it was classified as a preparatory condition. If a statement were
    yellow, it was classified as an ongoing requirement. And if a statement were green, it was
    classified as a promised blessing. Then I reviewed the 67 verses looking for patterns and
    relationships I had not previously noticed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">What I have described thus far is my method for identifying and
    studying key phrases, and in the Book of Mormon you can find a number of fascinating
    phrases. For example, you find the phrase <em>and thus we see</em> 17&nbsp;times in the
    Book of Mormon. <em>And thus we see</em> is an editorial exclamation point by Nephi or
    Moroni or another compiler who is saying in essence, &quot;Given this episode, given this
    experience, here is my summary of what you ought to learn.&quot; Any place in the Book of
    Mormon we find the phrase <em>and thus we see</em>, we ought to pay particular attention
    to what follows because a prophet scribe is summarizing what he has learned in the process
    of recording the material. Back to my method: I look for phrases, then I sort and group or
    cluster them by themes or common features. I learn a great deal by looking for patterns
    and associations.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">One of the first things I noticed and learned in this analysis is
    that the requirement to come unto Christ is universal (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0008.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 8</a>). It is summarized in 1
    Nephi 13:40. <em>&quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;These last records . . . shall establish the
    truth of the first, . . . and shall make known the plain and precious things which have
    been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that
    the Lamb of God is the son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that
    all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.&quot;</em> The requirement to come
    unto Christ is universal.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">On the right-hand side of the next slide (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0009.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 9</a>) is a column of
    numbers. These numbers indicate the frequency with which a particular phrase or topic was
    found in the 67&nbsp;verses. Please do not let these numbers become the principal focus of
    your attention. The numbers are helpful, but they merely point to relationships and
    patterns that are much more important. In addition, there could be errors in the way I
    grouped this information and summarized it. Nonetheless, I think they do show some
    interesting patterns.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">I want to first talk about <strong>preparatory conditions</strong>.
    Please remember that in the verses I studied, a preparatory condition came before the
    statement <em>come unto Christ</em>. <strong>Repentance</strong> is the most frequently
    mentioned preparatory condition; it is found 16 times. The nature of our approach to the
    process of coming unto Christ is mentioned next. Being <strong>humble, meek, having a
    broken heart and a contrite spirit, being heavy laden and poor in spirit</strong>, and
    verses with similar themes are found 13 times. I do not think either one of these first
    two findings, viewed individually, is very surprising or even very illuminating; but as
    you begin to link them together and see the frequency with which they are mentioned, that
    to me is very instructive. We next find references to <strong>doing the works of
    righteousness</strong>, i.e., <strong>conduct thyself wisely</strong>, a very
    action-oriented theme or requirement, mentioned four times. I would like you to especially
    pay attention to this next finding because what we will see as we move from preparatory
    conditions to ongoing requirements is a very subtle but significant difference. The
    phrases in these verses that precede the statement <em>come unto Christ</em> are <strong>believe
    in me</strong> (meaning the Savior), <strong>believe on my name</strong>, and <strong>be
    believing</strong>. The final thing that was mentioned as a preparatory condition was <strong>desire</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">I suspect that if you took the same verses and applied my method
    of analysis, you would obtain some of these same results. They might be a bit different.
    That is why I am cautioning everyone not to think that somehow these numbers are exact.
    But look at the totality of those requirements and consider the preparatory conditions as
    we begin the process of coming unto Christ, i.e., repenting, having a broken heart and a
    contrite spirit, believing in Christ, having a desire, and doing the works of
    righteousness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now, I would like to move to the <strong>ongoing requirements</strong>
    (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0010.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 10</a>). These are the phrases in the verses I studied that came after the phrase <em>come
    unto Christ</em>. The most frequently mentioned ongoing requirement is to <strong>be
    baptized for the remission of sins</strong>. That is not very surprising. Next is a
    category that includes a wide range of clearly defined, action-oriented phrases: <strong>hear,
    do, remember, offer, drink, call, endure, continue</strong>. At least eight words fall
    into this category. Please look at the next requirement very carefully: <strong>believe on
    me</strong> (which is similar to the preparatory condition), <strong>believe in all things
    which are good</strong>, and <strong>have faith in me</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">This is where I want to show a very subtle but significant
    distinction. Please turn to Omni in the Book of Mormon to verse 25. You will need to
    remember what I said about the preparatory condition, i.e., that it is faith focused in
    Christ and on his name and that we are to be believing. As we read verse 25, notice how
    the requirement for our faith is much broader, more expansive, and more comprehensive.
    Yes, it is faith; but it is a developing and evolving faith. It is an expanding faith that
    we are required to have. <em>&quot;And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having
    no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall
    deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all men to come unto God, the Holy One of
    Israel, [now watch what we are to have faith in] and believe in prophesying, and in
    revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues,
    and in the gift of interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for there is
    nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord: and that which is evil cometh from the
    devil.&quot;</em> It is not only believing in Christ, which is the preparatory condition,
    but we must continue to believe in Christ and in his gospel and in the gifts of the
    Spirit. It is a much more comprehensive requirement for our faith. Let us continue reading
    in verse 26: <em>&quot;And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto
    Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his
    redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, [watch
    for the action-oriented things that are required of us] and continue in fasting and
    praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.&quot;</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Our experience with the principle of faith should change as we
    develop spiritually and as we gain additional light and knowledge. Faith grows and
    develops. And that is a part of what I began to see as I looked at faith and belief as
    preparatory conditions. I could see that it is also an ongoing requirement as we press
    forward in the process of coming unto Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now, let us continue with the remainder of the ongoing
    requirements: <strong>obedience</strong>; <strong>keep the commandments</strong>; <strong>touch
    not the unclean thing</strong>; do so with <strong>full purpose of heart</strong>; and
    then <strong>receiving, being sanctified by, and being filled with the Holy Ghost</strong>.
    To me, the real value of these findings is not any one of them in isolation. Rather,
    increased understanding grows out of recognizing themes and patterns across the findings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">If you look at the ongoing requirements compared to the
    preparatory conditions, you will not find the word <em>repentance</em>. Does that mean you
    only need to repent before coming unto Christ and then you do not have to worry about
    repentance anymore? I believe repentance is a part of the ongoing requirement of <strong>doing</strong>.
    I think it is included in and distributed through a number of the ongoing requirements. In
    the same way that faith is an ever-increasing expectation as we are coming unto Christ, so
    is repentance. Repentance is repentance, but repentance changes. And as our faith is
    increasing and our knowledge is expanding, our repentance is changing as we are engaged in
    the process of coming unto Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now let us talk about <strong>promised blessings</strong> (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0011.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide
    11</a>). The first blessing is that we are <strong>redeemed, saved, spared, and rescued from
    our fallen condition</strong>. The second blessing is that we will <strong>find a place in
    the kingdom of God or in the kingdom of heaven</strong>. I found the third blessing to be
    particularly fascinating--that we will have <strong>greater knowledge</strong>, that we
    will <strong>be taught of God</strong>, that we will <strong>eat and drink of the waters
    of life freely</strong>. Some of these promised blessings are clearly &quot;there and
    then&quot; in the kingdom of God; some are clearly &quot;here and now&quot; as we are in
    the process of coming unto Christ in mortality. What follows are some of the &quot;here
    and now&quot; blessings: <strong>our soul shall live</strong>, <strong>we will have
    everlasting life</strong>, and <strong>we will experience rest and peace</strong>. I had
    never really considered the next theme until I recognized a number of verses emphasizing
    the same concept: <strong>him will I receive, I will receive him, will be numbered among
    my people</strong>. This is the Savior describing the sense of inclusion that will come as
    we receive the promised blessings. Think of the rest and the peace and the security that
    flows from the inclusion of being numbered among the Savior's people. I found that to be
    very powerful. And the final promised blessing: <strong>Mine arm of mercy is extended</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">What we have discussed thus far are the preparatory conditions,
    ongoing requirements, and promised blessings related to the invitation to come unto Christ
    that were found in the 67&nbsp;verses contained in the standard works.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now please ask yourself the following question: &quot;So what can
    I learn from all of this information?&quot; I have attempted to highlight a couple of key
    points as we went along, i.e., faith is faith, but faith changes; spiritual expectations
    are increased and elevated as we come unto Christ; and repentance is repentance, but
    repentance changes in some very significant ways. Can I give you an illustration of how
    repentance might change? It is one thing to turn away from sin in the process of
    repentance, but it is quite another to turn to God. It is one thing to seek for
    forgiveness of our sins; it is another thing to seek for our hearts to be purified. It is
    one thing to receive a remission of our sins; but it is an even greater thing, a more
    spiritually demanding thing, to always retain in remembrance the greatness of God. It is
    one thing to have our sins removed; it is a different thing to have the desire to sin
    removed. The process of coming unto Christ is not a process that is sequential with
    little, separate steps. In a Gospel Doctrine class we typically diagram spiritual progress
    with boxes and arrows, i.e., you do this first and then you do this. And we get the notion
    that we move through this series of sequential steps. In a few minutes I am going to show
    an illustration of a helix. A helix is like a coil; but as it spirals upwards, it expands
    and becomes broader. For me, the answer to the so what question is that these preparatory
    conditions and ongoing requirements are not sequential; they are continuous. We exercise a
    particle of faith, and we come unto Christ. We receive ordinances, and we continue in the
    process of coming unto Christ. And we believe in prophesying and in the gift of tongues,
    and it becomes broader and more expansive. The same thing is true with repentance as we
    continue to cycle upward in a very significant way.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">At this point I want to incorporate the teachings of Elder
    Merrill J. Bateman of the Seventy. Elder Bateman made a presentation by assignment to the
    Quorum of the Twelve Apostles entitled <em>Developing Faith in Christ</em>. In his work he
    summarizes several key principles about the process of developing faith in Christ. Part of
    what Elder Bateman suggests is that there are many levels of faith (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0012.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 12</a>). And there
    are steps within each level of faith that help us move to the next level (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0013.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 13</a>). For
    example, Alma 32 describes the steps that must be used within each level of faith. The
    first step is to have a hope or belief that something is true, i.e., <em>&quot;. . . if ye
    can no more than desire to believe . . .&quot;</em> (v. 27). So here we see that we must
    hope or believe that something is true. The second step is an action reflecting a
    willingness to believe and live this truth--in other words: <em>&quot;. . . experiment
    upon my words, . . . let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that
    ye can give place for a portion of my words&quot;</em> (v. 26-27). That is the action. And
    the third step is the witness of the Spirit or the confirmation that something is true.
    That is the swelling motions talked about in Alma 32. So we have the hope or the desire to
    believe, the willingness to experiment, and the swelling motions that come as a spiritual
    confirmation that something is true. These three steps are the same in each level of
    faith. They do not change. The steps are to have (1) a hope, (2) a willingness to
    experiment and take action, and (3) the spiritual confirmation from the Holy Ghost that
    what we have done is indeed true.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now let us look at some of the levels of faith (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0014.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 14</a>). The
    first level of faith is faith as hope. Think of the definition of faith in Hebrews: <em>&quot;.
    . . Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&quot;</em>
    (Hebrews 11:1). This is the hope of the investigator. This is the hope of one paying
    tithing for the first time. This is the hope of a convert giving up Word of Wisdom habits
    with the hope that indeed, as he/she is obedient, there will come promised blessings. This
    faith begins with hope and matures with righteousness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">The second level of faith is a combination of belief and
    knowledge. At this level of faith, evidence is added to our hope. Having paid my tithing,
    having lived the Word of Wisdom, having heeded the teachings of the living prophets, there
    comes a confirmation and evidence that indeed the principle is true. It is tender, it is
    young, it has not yet sunk deep into gospel soil. But the roots are beginning to sprout.
    This is the development of a tender testimony into continuing conversion. The seed of
    testimony <em>&quot;. . . swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow . . .&quot;</em>
    as talked about in Alma 32:33.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">The third level of faith is exceeding faith in Christ's redeeming
    power. Over time there comes an accumulation of evidence, significant and substantial
    spiritual confirmations, and our faith increases and becomes exceedingly strong. It might
    be that this is the faith talked about in 2 Nephi 31:20. <em>&quot;. . . press forward
    with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope . . . .&quot;</em>
    Once we have the desire and demonstrate a willingness to act, the spiritual confirmation
    will come. And the confirmation is the evidence of things not seen. As we have those
    experiences across a wide range of settings and in relation to many gospel principles,
    then there comes a perfect brightness of hope and exceeding faith in Christ. This is also
    reflected in the action aspect we identified in the ongoing requirements because then we
    are willing to do whatever God asks--whatever God asks, we will not withhold. </font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">The fourth level of faith is the fullness of all things. Here the
    person becomes a partaker of the divine nature. As happened to the brother of Jared, his
    faith became so strong that he could no longer be kept from within the veil. Perhaps this
    is the level of faith required for one to have his/her calling and election made sure.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">So we have discussed four levels of faith. Now I would like to
    illustrate how these levels and steps build (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0015.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 15</a>). Instead of boxes, it is a helix.
    Level one: faith is hope. The next level: faith is a combination of belief and knowledge.
    The next level: exceeding faith in Christ's redeeming power. Now notice that the process
    of coming unto Christ is continuing. It is not something we did on June 3, 1983, and then
    it is over. <em>&quot;. . . [coming] unto Christ, and [being] perfected in him . . .&quot;</em>
    (Moroni&nbsp;10:32) is an ongoing process. But the faith required to continue in that
    process develops and evolves and changes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now can I tell you what is wrong with this animation? It has some
    things that are right about it, but it also has some things that are lacking. It is right
    in that it is not portrayed through a series of sequential boxes, i.e., do this step, move
    to step two, and then you move to step three. That is a vast improvement. The bad thing
    about this illustration is that in real life the process does not work this smoothly. The
    better way to portray this process would be to have the line going all over the screen--it
    goes down a little bit, and it moves forward and up a little bit, and then it drops
    somewhat, and eventually it goes to the next level and begins dipping again. So we need to
    agree that, although this illustration is better than boxes on the board, it has some
    inaccuracies as well. But it does show how the levels of faith escalate. You never totally
    move beyond faith as hope; it is not a box we check off and say, &quot;I am done.&quot;
    Rather, we begin again and gain experience with a new principle. It spirals upward as a
    helix, building and continuing. Here is how that occurs. We move from level of faith to
    level of faith through desire, a willingness to experiment and act, and then receiving a
    spiritual confirmation as evidence of things not seen. This process and experience bolster
    our faith. Consequently, we exhibit an increased willingness to experiment and receive an
    even greater confirmation. Our confidence waxes stronger, line upon line, precept upon
    precept, here a little and there a little.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Let's look at another illustration (<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/President/_superceded/ComeUntoChrist_files/Slide0016.gif" target="_self" style="color: #0078F0">Slide 16</a>). We also have
    talked about levels of repentance. The principle is exactly the same. I previously
    presented a series of scriptural phrases that highlight the differences in how we repent.
    As we are coming unto Christ, we repent. We continue in the process of coming unto Christ.
    Our repentance is changing. The spiritual requirements and expectations are elevated, and
    we continue to come unto Christ. We continue to repent, but the focus of our repentance is
    changing; and we see it escalate and spiral in exactly the same way. I suspect at the low
    end of the helix that we are repenting of many sins of commission. The farther up the
    helix we go, the more we are repenting of sins of omission. So repentance is repentance,
    but it changes as we are engaged in the process of coming unto Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Brothers and sisters, David O. McKay taught and President
    Hinckley frequently quotes this statement by President McKay: &quot;. . . the purpose of
    the gospel is . . . to make bad men good and good men better, and to change human
    nature&quot; (Film &quot;Every Member A Missionary,&quot; as acknowledged by Franklin D.
    Richards, Conference Report, October 1965, p.&nbsp;136-137). May I suggest to you that the
    Book of Mormon contains the handbook of instructions on how to travel the path from bad to
    good to better to the mighty change of heart. We will be blessed and benefitted by
    recognizing both similarities and differences in fundamental principles such as faith in
    Christ and repentance. Although they are the same, they will change as we progress along
    the pathway of bad to good to better. A particular type of faith is required to go from
    bad to good, to receive the ordinances of the Aaronic priesthood, to be cleansed from sin.
    That takes a certain kind of faith. But it takes an even greater faith to go from good to
    better, to receive the ordinances of the Melchizedek priesthood in the house of the Lord,
    and to seek for sanctification. That is a part of what I learned as I studied and pondered
    the very subtle differences between preparatory conditions, ongoing requirements, and
    promised blessings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">I find the patterns and distinctions we have discussed this
    morning to be an additional confirmation that Joseph Smith could not have written the Book
    of Mormon. He did not have the capability to express such concepts with his rudimentary
    education and the amount of time he had to work on the translation, which was perhaps 80
    days. Opponents and critics of the Church have claimed, &quot;He had the plates for much
    longer than 80 days.&quot; To which I have told them: &quot;I do not care. He could have
    worked on such a book for 50 years. If you want to argue about the time period, fine. Give
    him 100 years. Give him 200 years. Give him a staff of 80 of the best editors and
    assistants on the earth. But it would not make any difference. He could not have used
    language that eloquent, that precise, and which highlighted such important spiritual
    distinctions. It just could not be done.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">But more than the logical conclusion that comes from my study is
    the witness of the Spirit that testifies that these things are true. I conclude today
    where I began. Brothers and sisters, I know God lives. I witness that Jesus is the Christ.
    I know the Father and the Son appeared to the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, and that their
    visitation was the beginning of the restoration of the fullness of the gospel in these
    latter days. The Book of Mormon is the tangible evidence that those events really
    occurred. You cannot discount the book. It came from someplace. A person inquiring after
    truth must answer the question, &quot;Where did this book come from?&quot; It either had
    to come as a deception from an evil source or as a tangible testament of truth from a
    heavenly source. Let me quote again the statement of George Cannon, the father of George
    Q. Cannon: &quot;No wicked man could write such a book as this, and no good man would
    write it unless it were true and he were commanded of God to do so&quot; (LDS Biographical
    Encyclopedia, Andrew Jenson, Vol. 1, pg. 42).</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">I testify that the Book of Mormon is true; it came from God. It
    was written for our day, and its central theme is the invitation for all to come unto
    Christ. I pray that each of us may be more diligent in our efforts to come unto Christ. I
    appreciate your attentiveness, I appreciate your faith and prayers, and I express
    gratitude for the assistance of the Spirit this day in attempting to communicate this
    message. I declare this witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font>

<p><font color="#000080">Brother and sisters, you have inspired leaders. And we were
      touched and I and our daughter Mindy that remarkable rendering of an anthem
      written by Crawford Gates. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am here, having set aside the prepared talk that I had, and
      hope you will permit me to open my heart on another topic.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let's begin with a glimpse of Church history. One day in Nauvoo,
      Brigham Young (not long in the Church) approached the Prophet's father who was the
      Patriarch. "I would like," he said, "a patriarchal blessing." For some
      reason the senior Joseph Smith was committed to something, could not pull away, and said
      to Brother Brigham Young: "Here. Here is a piece of paper. Sit down at this table and
      write down every good thing you seek in righteousness, and I will sign it and that will be
      your patriarchal blessing." Staggering.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I was a little boy we used to get into the contest of what
      you would wish if you only had three wishes. But somebody ended the game by saying,
      "Well, if I had only one wish, I would wish for all the wishes I could ever wish
      for." </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, in the heritage of the House of Israel we
      receive and give patriarchal blessings. "A paragraph," as one of my great and
      admired mentors taught, "a paragraph from the book of our possibilities." That
      was Karl G. Maeser.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Without asking that you open your scriptures (which I now know
      you all have), I want to refer to three other patriarchal blessings besides your own that
      I believe were given for you and should be as clearly written in your aspirations as any
      specific promise or counsel you have from your own personal blessing. Before I do, may I
      mention that in the course of my life, which is stretching out, I have known many
      patriarchs in the Church and have had the privilege of counseling with them. Most
      recently, as a stake president, I have had the association of Brother Bruce R. Clark who
      has been a patriarch for more than 20 years. He is now in his eighty-second year and still
      clear and inspired. He has taught me that the anguish and the initial shock of such a call
      is overwhelming responsibility of not only giving a blessing but knowing that every
      word of it will be recorded and that for the rest of the person's life it will be sought
      after, and probed, and prayed over, and that, therefore, he is in effect speaking
      scripture. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He, among the many that I have talked to, was not surprised at
      his call. It's one of the interesting common elements in the lives of most of our
      patriarchs that at some point in their lives there is a premonition, a herald, a
      whispering<i>this calling will come to you.</i>"&nbsp; I know even of one case
      where the General Authority walked in on a brother the morning of a Sunday and said,
      "Do you know why you're here?" And he replied, "Yes." &nbsp;&nbsp;
      "Are you willing?"&nbsp; "Yes."&nbsp; "Sit down."&nbsp; And
      he put his hands on him and ordained him a patriarch. He knew in advance. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Well that same challenge rests upon any in our history who have
      served in the callingswith Joseph Smith leading. And the blessing I have in
      mind that reflects your past, which all patriarchal blessings sooner or later do, is
      section 86 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Don't open. But on a future occasion you might
      look at what precedes the verses I am going to quote. It's a reference to the great
      parable of the tares and the wheat. And you live in a generation where the tares are
      winning tare getting "tarier" and the wheat getting "wheatier."
      &nbsp; And the contest is real. It says:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"[Blessed are ye] with whom the priesthood hath continued
          through the lineage of your fathers."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And now listen: </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"For ye [this is talking about you] are lawful heirs,
          according to the flesh [meaning you have been born in this dispensation in the House of
          Israel either by adoption or birth you are now in it] . . .</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"For ye are lawful heirs according to the flesh, and have
          been hid from the world with Christ in God</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and
          must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things . . .
          "</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And then skipping just a little:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness
          ["continue" means you didn't begin in his goodness in this world]Blessed
          are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto the Gentiles, and through this
          priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">That is your first patriarchal blessing in the Doctrine and
      Covenants. Now another.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are verses in "The Vision." Brother Crawford
      Gates wrote a magnificent pageant of "Visions of Eternity" which is his musical
      arrangement of the section we call 76, sung and performed where it was first commissioned
      here at Ricks College. We have it on video and audio, and I have occasionally played it
      for my stake family and said: "Look at those young people and listen to their music.
      And then ask yourself if their faces aren't different than some of the rock groups you see
      on television." It says, among other things, that you will receive after your
      testimony of Jesus, baptism ". . . being buried in the water . . ." as was
      Christ before you. It says that you will ". . . receive the Holy Ghost . . . [under]
      the hands of him who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [has been] ordained and sealed unto this power."
      And then it says of you: "And who overcome by faith [and it means faith in Christ]
      are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the father sheds forth upon all those who
      are just and true." And then there are verses that have so many <i>alls</i> and 
		<i>everys</i>
      it is incomprehensible. "Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or
      things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is
      God's. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[Therefore] they shall overcome all things."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And now the last one. There are verses in section 84 of the
      Doctrine and Covenants. I have heard these verses quoted to explain why it is possible
      that some of our aged men and women still seem to have an effervescent youth and are
      quickened and strengthened in their service. Yes, that is one application. I insert that
      it is striking to me that we have both the most incredibly young leaders in this Church
      and the most incredibly old. Do you know the average age of the men called to the First
      Council of the Twelve in this dispensation? Twenty-six; twenty-six. Do you know the
      earliest age of a man called to the Twelve? Twenty-three. Do you know when at least a
      dozen that I have studied first had their intimations that they had a mission in life and
      had dreams and/or visions of their unfolding lives? Age, on average, nine; nine! It is
      almost as if the heavens could not wait. The years of accountability, nine,
      immediately! On the other hand, we have a president who is coming up on his ninetieth
      year. Vigorous. Inspired. Blessed. And that is because living the gospel has begun to
      regenerate the race. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, back to my third blessing. " . . . .whoso [it says]
      [receiveth] . . . these two priesthoods" the Aaronic and the Melchizedek, and
      it applies to the sisters because it applies <i>whoso receive the blessings through these
      two priesthoods </i> ". . . and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by
      the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There is an interesting anecdote of two little girls in Sunday
      School. One turns to the other and says with a bit of pride, "My grandfather is the
      prophet." The other little girl thinks about that and then says, "My grandfather
      is God."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listen to this promise. Who is your father?&nbsp; Listen to
      this." [You] are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of [your] bodies."
      [Verse 33] And now the deeper meaning of that transformation: They become the sons and or
      daughters. "They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and
      the church and kingdom, and the elect of God." [Verse 34] Wherefore, and I am jumping
      a little, ". . . all that [the] father hath shall be given unto [them]." [Verse
      38] <i>All</i>. There is that word again. <i>All</i>. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Having been, as I have, a stake president and before that a
      faculty member and, as you've heard, long associated with missionary work. I probably have
      interviewed over 3,000 missionaries coming or going or both. Students want to know what
      they'll be when they grow up, and they have become particularly anxious about that since
      they have grown up. I have learned a couple of things about preparing for a life
      mission not just a two-year or eighteen-month mission. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have learned, first of all, from serious academic work that
      (though you may not believe me and I put it so starkly) everyone sitting here today is a
      genius at something. Every one of you has an intellectual gift. It is indirectly related
      to what we are so intimidated by, which is the IQ (which, by the way, does not measure
      everything and even what it does measure can be changed; so it is often misleading). You
      are a genius at something. You may not have discovered it, but it is there. And every one
      of you, according to the teachings of the modern restoration, has at least one spiritual
      giftat least one. And you have been counseled to pray on the behalf of your leaders
      that they may have of all gifts the gift of discernment which enables them to see in you
      as the Lord would see: the good when others cannot, the promise when others cannot, the
      gold that is in the mine when other people treat you in other ways. In addition to that
      knowledge, I have the testimony that there are a cluster of gifts and talents that all of
      us are more or less good at, all of which are needed in the work of the kingdom. No matter
      what you do in life or vocation, whatever you do to earn and supply and support, these
      will be needed. Just this week we have learned (I hardly dare state these because they
      change so quickly), we know that there will be100 temples if President Hinckley has his
      way. I predict he will. One hundred temples before this year ends! The growth is becoming
      exponential. There will be need within five years for us to ordain in any one week 1500
      bishops. There will be need within the same five years to have at least 600 General
      Authorities just to administer the affairs of a worldwide Church which is now in 170
      countries. What are the talents everyone needs to cultivate in recognizing these needs?
      Well, among others, it is obvious you allone of you going to have to be a
      teacher. You are going to have to communicate and teach. That is even if you have no other
      singular calling than home teaching, visiting teaching, or your home and family. But,
      likely, you will have dozens of calls to teach and/or speak. There is a worldwide Church
      program to upgrade teaching. And the letter from the First Presidency says: &nbsp;
      "You who call yourselves leaders [stake presidents, bishops], you also must
      understand you are teachers. And you must become better teachers." </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, it is obvious that every one of you will need to be, as
      we say out of Harvard Business School, <i>administrators</i> who can organize, and
      plan, and implement, and follow up. That is the nature of any organization. This is an
      organization. It is said that if three Mormons bail out of an airplane, before they hit
      the ground they will have a president and two counselors. True, except that does not quite
      cover the ground. (If they were Mormons they would have organized before they jumped and
      had somebody waiting for them.) </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Third, it is obvious, and this is more important even than the
      other two, that if the Lord is going to have witnesses and leaders and faithful parents
      they have to be worthy; and worthy means pure. And the blessings I have quoted, and I
      suspect your own in most instances, refer to the needabsolute needget the
      power of the Lord Jesus Christ into the very veins of your blood and transform you and
      purge you of whatever is amiss or whatever poisons you have taken. On the word poison,
      indulge me for a brief visit to the Holy Land.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here was a group of BYU students sent out to have a
      "kibbutz" experience, which meant cutting back certain trees. They were warned
      when they went into this grove. "Somewhere out there you may run onto a thing,
      black. They are known as vipers. Don't touch them! As soon as you see one, call us; and we
      will take care of it." We had an older student who'd had some experience with snakes.
      He came onto one. He took hold of it right up by the top of the neck. Instantly the viper
      turned and bit him, and his arm began to swell almost visibly. They ran. They ran for what
      they thought was the antidote. They gave him a shot. It wasn't the antidote. It was a
      tetanus shot. And by the time he realized he had not been given the antidote, he was
      already in critical condition. They took him to the hospital. Ann and I both visited. He
      barely survived after a priesthood blessing. The pain, the anguish, the swelling, the
      almost black-looking hand were unspeakably horrible. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You live, as the Master said you would, in a generation of
      vipers. And I won't dwell on it except to tell you that the use of drugs is addictive; the
      use of pornography is addictive; the use of other substances that are now being called
      date drugs are not only poison, they will kill you. They will burn your brain ultimately.
      They will destroy your conscience. And you get to the point where you care about only one
      thingown habit. And you will hurt your loved ones, and you will be unworthy of
      serving the Lord in His kingdom. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now there is always through Christ a way of starting back, but
      preventive medicine is better than medicine. I plead with you. If you don't start, you
      never have to stop. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now I was talking of talents. I will just name six that a man
      named Calvin Taylor classifies. There is actually a book on this that has 120 talents
      listed. It would be interesting for you to read that sometime and find out if you fit
      anywhere. The educational system often teaches you fairly early, like about kindergarten,
      where you are weak. And you assume that you are no good across the board and figure you
      are going to have to work harder than anybody else. It would be marvelous if we had a
      system that could help you find out at age five where your strengths are and then
      cultivate them. I do not believe they were given to be abused; I think they were given to
      be used, and you have them. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here are the six he talks about: </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He talks about <i>academic. </i>That is a talent in a way. There
      are people who seem to have a special gift for getting through school, for pleasing their
      professors, writing the right kinds of papers, getting grades. I do not like the grading
      system, but I do not know any other way to deal with this problem. Some people are just
      specially blessed to academics; they are the ones who end up being the teachers. Well,
      that is a blessing. And I repeat the statement <b>you all will be teachers</b> no matter
      what else you ever do. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, he talks about <i>creative talents</i>. And those are the
      sort of glamour ones we all think about. The power of music and singing, sculpture,
      painting, the arts, dancing, and all the spinoffs of those. Some of you have those gifts,
      greatly. Some of you may be as my grandfather was, tone deaf. (In the resurrection it is
      promised that you will be able to make a joyful noise.) </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then he talks about three that are closely related: 
		<i>planning</i>,
      which I suspect would lead you into architecture, engineering, and other things; 
		<i>wisdom</i>,
      which no one can quite define but some people have it. They may not know any specifics
      about a problem, but they are wise in counsel (sometimes comes with age). And then there
      is what they call <i>forecasting</i>. I suppose this is the weatherman phenomenon, being
      able to anticipate certain trends or movements or activities. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Finally, <i>communication</i>. The evidence is that those who are
      good at conveying ideas or a vision or a gift to others are also remarkably able in
      listening. In the real world, communicationall of its advertised power, and it is
      powerfuloften a weakness if we're talking about spiritual things. For ultimately, it
      isn't a performance the Lord wants from any of you; it's the worthiness to stand and have
      the Spirit of the Lord go through you so that you who teach and you who listen are as
      section 50 says Aboth edified" and "both rejoice together." <i>Both. 
		</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As a professional teacher I have been puzzled over two
      things. One, that sometimes after all the preparation I know how to make, including
      spiritual preparation, I have gone into a class and even though I've tried to do it
      rightdoesn't quite go over. And I know it. And I think the students do, but they're
      kind enough not to say too much. On the other hand, I have gone in not as well prepared in
      the intellectual sense but humbled with the responsibility (maybe didn't even have time to
      offer a genuine full prayer), and the Spirit of the Lord comes into the meeting. And I go
      home saying to myself: I was blessed, but somebody else was blessed. My theory is that
      happens because the Lord wants to bless you recipient he uses an instrument,
      however incompetent, to do that. Well, your strength (in that sense) is your weakness.
      Your strength is to acknowledge before the Lord that you are dependent upon him and that
      if you do not receive the Spirit, you will not teach. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The other thing that I marvel at is that when the Spirit of the
      Lord is present in a meeting, it isn't just words that carryover. It is the face. It is
      the person himself. I said once to a man, who had touched me deeply, that he could have
      stood up and counted to ten and I would have been inspired just because of the majesty of
      the spirit that was with him. I feel that way at times when I am truly sensitive in a
      general conference. President Hinckley, to me, is a beautiful man; and he would say he is
      homely. But when the Spirit is with him, he is magnificent. And his very face and his
      smile and his expressions carry a message, and it rings true. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now brothers and sisters, one of the patriarchs I knew told me
      this story. He said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I was hesitant to give blessings at first; and until I had had
          the experience, I hardly slept. One day a girl came in. Though I had never designated
          Judah as a lineage, I placed my hands upon her head and it came to me 
				<i>she is of the
          House of Judah</i>. And immediately she began to weep. And for the rest of the blessing
          she was sobbing. When I finished I thought that it was because she was surprised and
          perhaps disappointed at what I had said. I said, "Sister, Judah is a wonderful
          lineage to be from." And she said: "Oh. It wasn't that. I had impressions in my
          early life of this but there is no evidence in our family history that I am of
          Judah." </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Well, he went on to tell me that he has given (let's say)
      hundreds (I think it is thousands) of blessings and that he has come away from those with
      two convictions which apply to everyone, whatever their differences. The first is that in
      every case when he has given a patriarchal blessing, he has known that the Lord our God
      loves this person. He has felt it. He has yearned to transmit it. And he has stated it
      often: "You are beloved of God." That has been true even when he has sensed
      under inspiration that the person is not fully worthy and perhaps is even involved in
      deception and some self-deception because of transgression. He still feels the love of
      God. The other is that in every case he has felt and has most of the time said that, that
      person has a lifetime mission for which he or she was prepared before the foundations of
      the earth. Let's see, how far back do we go in our memory? We have amnesia. We do not know
      our name and rank and serial number from before. We have a name we received in this world.
      Yes, a name and a blessing. But a patriarch is gifted sometimes to see earlier than that
      and to speak of that prior world. It is real. We were nurtured there. And we were sent at
      this time and in these circumstances and perhaps to the very families we came, however
      traumatic some of the experiences are, because the Lord knew that is what we needed to
      experience. That exactly defines our lifetime mission. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have a conviction from retrospect of my own life that all these
      blessings we are talking about, and they ultimately become <i>all</i> blessings, are
      indeed conditional. But the Lord surely knows who he has sent into the world and where
      they are. And the Lord surely knows, even when you do not, that the gold is in the mine.
      In my case, I received what one of my friends would call an "iffy" blessing. So
      many "ifs" that I wondered if I could ever really inherit the promises.
      "If," one paragraph begins, "you are faithful" (this is when I was 17)
      . . . "If you are faithful and true and studious and diligent and humble and
      prayerful then . . . ." Well, good heavens. But the "then" came true
      because I tried to be those things. And that is true of youof you. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Another patriarch whom I greatly honor whose name was Winslow
      Farr Smith (close relative of George Albert Smith and related to that remarkable twosome,
      the Joseph F. Smith and the Joseph Fielding Smith, each of whom rose high in the kingdom)
      said to me: "You know, more patriarchal blessings are not fulfilled than are."
      And that struck me. I did not like to hear that. He said: "Because [finishing his
      sentence] the persons do not fulfill the conditions, and then the promises fail."
      See, the glory of it is the Lord never, ever breaks his word. He never breaks a covenant,
      he never breaks his word. But we, being free, can do so.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now in summing up and in closing: The late President Wilford
      Woodruff gave a blessing to a missionary about to depart, and it was recorded. In due time
      he, Wilford Woodruff, saw to it that it was published because said he: "This blessing
      doesn't just apply to Elder [so and so] but generally to the youth of Zion." Several
      of our presidents were so (in their late years) grateful, impressed with their blessings
      and their fulfillment that they made them public knowledge. In the case of President
      Lorenzo Snow, he saw to it that for a time while he was president of the Salt Lake Temple
      his blessing was put on the wall. Now that is not what most of you are counseled to do.
      You are counseled to keep it to yourself; but he was the president, and he wanted the
      Church to know that the blessings pronounced upon him had been vindicated. I am
      paraphrasing slightly, but this is the paragraph I wanted to share with you:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord has reserved a number of choice spirits out of all the
          creations of God [I remind you that the creations of God are extensive and even, by our
          reckoning, numberless] . . . Out of all those creations he has selected a group of choice
          spirits and has kept them in the Spirit World for 6000 years [which I take it means since
          the time of Adam or approximately] in order for them to come into the Church and the world
          in this last dispensation. [Now listen to his summary of why.] That they may receive the
          testimony of Jesus Christ; that they may receive the eternal and everlasting priesthood
          and its blessings; that they may build up the kingdom of God unto him and prepare
          themselves and the world for the second coming of Jesus Christ. Brother [so and so, he
          finished] you are one of these. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My testimony to you today is: Brothers and sisters, you are among
      those. You are in the time when the very most valiant will be needed in the final
      struggle; and, not only that, you are equipped amidst those who are untried and who are
      faltering and failing and who have not even comprehended the beginnings of the gospel of
      Jesus Christ. I bear you my witness that the Lord Jesus Christ lives; that He loves you;
      and that a patriarchal blessing is His message to you in His time. He wants you to serve
      him at your best. He wants you to rise to the majesty of your privileges which always
      involve responsibilities. He wants you to avoid the vipers that are in the world today and
      live close to Him. And He promises that He will be with you and be before you and ahead of
      you in the unfolding of your life. I bear that witness in the name of Jesus Christ, 
		amen.</font></p>

        AM THE LIGHT WHICH SHINETH IN THE DARKNESS&quot;</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#004040"><b>Ricks College Campus Education Week Devotional<br />
</b>
<strong>June 1, 2000<br />
President David A. Bednar</strong><br />
<font color="#004040" size="2">©2000 by Ricks College. All rights reserved</font></font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Good morning, brothers and sisters.  The theme for this year's Education Week, <em>I am
the light which shineth in the darkness</em>, is an important one.  And it is a challenging one.  I
began my preparation for my visit with you this morning by finding all of the verses in the
standard works that contain both the words <em>light</em> and <em>darkness</em>; there are 117.  I have read
them all, and what I would like to do this morning is share with you three specific scriptural
episodes.  I invite you to have your scriptures on your lap and follow along.  If you do not
have your scriptures, please be aware that many of the verses I refer to will be projected on
the screen over head.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The real purpose of what we will try to accomplish in these few minutes together is to
increase our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in the light that comes from him.  The wish of
my heart is that my presentation this morning will not be perceived as a "speech."  I am not
interested in talking at you.  I would much rather talk <span style="text-decoration: underline">with</span> you.  It is a little difficult in an
auditorium of this size to achieve that objective, but I hope we will be able to create that
feeling together.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The first scriptural episode I want to highlight begins with verses 10 and 11 in
3&nbsp;Nephi, chapter 11.  "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into
the world.  And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; . . ." (3 Nephi 11:10-11).  I
would like to emphasize two things in these verses.  First, please consider the phrase <em>light and
life of the world</em>.  The light that comes through the atonement of Jesus Christ enables us to
overcome spiritual death.  The life that comes through the resurrection of Jesus Christ enables
us to overcome physical death.  Now please note the significance of His first pronouncement
after declaring who He is, "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, . . . [and] I am the light and the life
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."  In other words, through the light and life of the Savior, the way is provided for
overcoming both spiritual and physical death.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now let us consider a second element of these particular verses.  Please consider the
setting and the context for the Savior's declaration, ". . . behold, I am the light and the life of
the world."  This statement occurs after the Father introduces and declares who Jesus Christ
is.  In verse&nbsp;7 we read, "Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have
glorified my name--hear ye him."  We have already read in verse 10 where Jesus declares who
He is and describes Himself as the light and the life of the world.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Would you consider what it must have been like to witness the Savior descending from
the heavens and making these declarations?  Please assume that you and I were there then and
each of us was 45 years of age at the time this supernal event took place.  Now, what we are
going to do is examine the context and the power of that statement by going back in time and
then coming forward.  If you were 45 years of age at the time the Savior appeared, consider
how old you would have been when Samuel the Lamanite prophesied about the coming of
Jesus Christ.  You will find a portion of that prophesy recorded in Helaman&nbsp;14:3.  If at the
time of the Savior's appearance you were 45, then you were approximately 5 or 6 years of age
when Samuel the Lamanite made this prophesy:  "And behold, this will I give unto you for a
sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that
in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto
man as if it was day" (Helaman 14:3).  Continuing on in verse 4:  "Therefore, there shall be
one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be
unto you for a sign; . . . nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night
before he is born" (Helaman 14:4).  Remember, you heard this prophesy when you were 5 or
6 years old.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now five or six years after Samuel the Lamanite made that prophecy, you were
perhaps 11 or 12 years of age, and circumstances had changed.  You will recall, as recorded
in 3 Nephi, chapter 1, a day was set apart by the unbelievers that all of those who believed in
the coming of Christ would be put to death.  You and I were awaiting the sign of His coming
and also were faced with the impending deadline.  And then, indeed, the sign foretold by
Samuel the Lamanite appeared.  In the midst of this religious persecution and at the tender age
of 11 or 12, you marveled one evening as the sun went down but there was no darkness. 
Consider the impact of that experience upon your 11- or 12- year-old mind and heart, and
consider the power of that memory upon you many years later as a 45-year-old adult as the
Savior appears and declares, ". . . behold, I am the light and the life of the world."  As a
small child, you literally saw the light associated with the birth of the Lord, Jesus Christ. 
Now, 34&nbsp;years later, you are a mature adult, you have lived a life of faith and obedience, and
you behold the face of the Lord and hear His voice.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	As we read in 3 Nephi, chapter 8, prior to the coming of the Savior to the American
continent, there had been great upheaval. You survived tempests and earthquakes and fires and
whirlwinds and dramatic physical upheavals, all of which attest to the crucifixion and death of
the Savior in the Old World.  Even some of your friends and family died in this tremendous
physical upheaval.  It is in this setting that you now experience, as one of the signs of His
death, three days of intense darkness.  We read in 3&nbsp;Nephi 8:20 a description of the darkness
that accompanied His death.  "And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the
face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could feel the vapor
of darkness."  I think that darkness is something that none of us has experienced with quite the
intensity that is described in this verse.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Let us read together in verse 21:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles,
neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and
exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the
sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which
were upon the face of the land.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there
was no light seen; . . . yea, great were the groaning of the people, because of
the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them (3&nbsp;Nephi
8:21-23).</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now consider what it must have been like to experience those three days of intense
darkness.  In the midst of that darkness, you then hear the voice of the Savior proclaim His
divinity, announce that the law of Moses is fulfilled, and He invites all to come unto Him and
be saved.  The three days of darkness pass away, and at some later time--we do not know
exactly how much later--you are gathered with the multitude of 2,500 people at the temple in
the land of Bountiful.  Brothers and sisters, imagine if you can, the majesty of the moment as
the Savior descends from the heavens and declares, "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. . . . I am the
light and the life of the world."  Can you imagine being 5 or 6 at the time of Samuel, 11 at the
time of the Savior's birth, and 45 at the time of His coming, having literally experienced the
light and the darkness that signified His coming and His death.  Think again of the theme of
our Education Week:  <em>I am the light which shineth in darkness</em>.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now let us discuss a second scriptural episode which is found in the book of
Helaman. 
In the early chapters in the Book of Helaman, we read about the ministry of Nephi and
Lehi,
the sons of Helaman.  These two spiritual giants were raised up in a wicked day to declare
repentance and lead believing souls to the peace of the gospel.  At this time in the Book of
Mormon, approximately 30 years before the birth of Christ, the government of the Nephites
was ripening for destruction because the majority of the people were choosing evil and
corrupting good laws and framing evil ones.  The people had become so corrupted that the
voice of the people chose that which was evil.  As a result, they turned from just laws and
righteous principles and would not be governed by such.  The people desired to be governed
by principles that the righteous leaders, Nephi and Lehi, knew would surely lead to physical
captivity, destruction, and ultimately to spiritual death.  Such is the setting and the context for
the experiences and the teachings of Nephi and Lehi, the sons of Helaman.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now let us turn to Helaman 5:28.  Please remember the description I have provided of
the overall setting.  "And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of
darkness, and an awful solemn fear came upon them."  Brothers and sisters, may I suggest
that this cloud of darkness, as described in Helaman, chapter 5, is a physical manifestation of
the spiritual darkness that blanketed their unrepentant souls.  In verse 34 we read, "And it
came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee because of the cloud of darkness which did
overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable because of the fear which did come
upon them."  Now, note what occurs in verses 35 and 36:  "Now there was one among them
who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God but had dissented
from them."  This was a man who had fallen away.  His name was Aminadab.  His name is
not a particularly significance piece of information other than it is important to remember that
the pronoun <em>he</em> in the remainder of this passage refers to Aminadab, who at one point was a
faithful follower of Christ.  "And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw
through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine
exceedingly, even as the faces of angels. . . ."  Now skip to verses 40 and 41. "And it came
to pass that the Lamanites said unto him:  What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may
be removed from overshadowing us?"  This is the response given by Aminadab:  "And
Aminadab said unto them:  You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have
faith in Christ . . . and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from
overshadowing you."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Consider the theme <em>I am the light which shineth in darkness</em>.  Consider the impact of
the atonement of Christ in dispelling spiritual darkness.  Truly, Christ is the light which
shineth.  His atoning sacrifice makes it possible for each of us to have the clouds of sin and
selfishness removed from overshadowing us.  His atonement is both infinite and intimate.  It
redeems us from the consequences of the fall and strengthens us to do the works of
righteousness.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Consider, again, the phrase <em>light and the life of the world</em>.  Through the atonement of
Christ, we overcome both spiritual death and physical death--the light and the life.  We make
that light operable in our lives through the first principles and ordinances of the gospel--faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift
of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.  Consider, again, the power of Aminadab's
teaching about how to dispel the cloud of darkness.  "You must repent, and cry unto the voice,
even until ye shall have faith in Christ . . . and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness
shall be removed from overshadowing you."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Consider, again, that statement by the Savior as He appears to the people in the land of
Bountiful:  ". . . behold, I am the light and the life . . . ."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Consider also the imagery presented by Lehi as he partakes of the fruit of the tree of
life.  In 1 Nephi 8:11, we find a fascinating description of the fruit which comes from the tree: 
"And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it
was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted.  Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof
was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen."  The tree is Christ.  The fruit is
the atonement and the associated blessings made operable in our lives.  How appropriate that
the fruit of the tree of Christ would be described as white, a whiteness ". . . to exceed all . . .
that I had ever seen."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	". . . I am the light and the life . . .," He said.  And our theme for Education Week is
<em>I am the light which shineth in darkness</em>.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now let us discuss a third scriptural episode, found in the third chapter of Ether.  We
recall that the brother of Jared constructed barges to travel to the New World.  He had a major
concern and problem, i.e., it would be very dark in the barges.  How could he have light in
the barges?  He prayed and was basically told, "Brother of Jared, you make a proposal.  You
come up with an idea."  He concluded that he would fashion 16 stones and ask the Lord to
make them bright.  In Ether&nbsp;3:5 we read a portion of the prayer offered by the brother of
Jared: "Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this.  We know that thou art able to show forth great
power, which looks small unto the understanding of men."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Verse 6 is the one I really want to emphasize.  Listen carefully:  "And it came to pass
that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand
and touched the stones one by one with his finger.  And the veil was taken from off the eyes of
the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; . . . ."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now I would ask this question:  Why were the 16 stones touched one by one?  Why
not simply illuminate all 16 stones all at once?  Why take the time to touch them one by one? 
Can I just make a suggestion?  There are at least two ways to interpret what takes place in
verse 6.  One interpretation is that the brother of Jared saw the finger of the Lord touch each
of the 16 stones.  That interpretation, however, I believe is contrary to the principle we find
throughout the scriptures that we receive no witness until after the trial of our faith. 
Interpretation number two!  Imagine you are the brother of Jared, praying that the stones will
be illuminated?  And, indeed, the finger of the Lord touches the stone, but the veil has not yet
been removed from your eyes.  You observe the first of the 16 stones is illuminated in
response to your prayer.  What would happen to your faith?  It would increase; it would be
strengthened.  Now a second stone is illuminated and a third and a fourth, and 16 separate
times you experience what is described in Alma, chapter 32.  Exercise a particle of faith. 
Experiment upon the word.  Feel those swelling motions, and pure knowledge ultimately
replaces faith.  And <span style="text-decoration: underline">then</span>, after all of the stones are illuminated, the veil is removed.  Look in
verse 6.  Let us read it again.  "And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said
these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with
his finger.  And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, . . . ."  One way
of interpreting that passage is that it was after the stones had been illuminated that the veil was
removed.  We receive no witness until after the trial of our faith.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now you might be saying, "Brother Bednar, why are you making such a big deal out
of verse 6?"  Here is the answer.  May I suggest that this episode with the brother of Jared is
a type and shadow for our own service in our families and in the Church.  As a bishop and as
a stake president, I have worked with sin-sick souls who had little or no light in their
countenances.  Those sin-sick souls were touched by the finger of the Lord through the
process of repentance, and the light in their souls gradually returned.  Many of you seated here
today have had precisely that same experience.  We may not have seen the literal finger of the
Lord touch the hearts of the people we serve, but we have seen the whiteness of the fruit of
the atonement of Jesus Christ reflected in the lives of those repentant souls.  They are touched
one by one.  What once was dark because of sin and transgression again is light because of the
atonement of Jesus Christ.  <em>I am the light which shineth in darkness</em>.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Brothers and sisters, Christ, indeed, is the light.  We live at a time when there has
come a wonderful flood of additional light about the Light.  Consider, if you will, the role of
the light in the darkness in each of the three scriptural episodes we have discussed and
remember our theme <em>I am the light which shineth in darkness</em>.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I know that He lives and is the Light; I witness and testify that He is real.  I know that
He directs the affairs of this church, even this latter-day kingdom, established again upon the
earth in its fullness.  I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p align="left">Brothers and sisters, the summer of 2000 at
      Ricks College has been both historic and hectic. May I suggest that the announcement made
      by President Hinckley on June 21 concerning the future of Ricks College was not really
      about two-year nor four-year status, was not really about academic rank nor athletics, and
      was not really about a name change. The primary issue in President Hinckley's announcement
      was faith. </p>
<p>The topic of my message this afternoon is the first principle of the restored gospel,
      faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Let me begin by emphasizing that the first principle of
      the gospel is not simply faith; rather, the first principle of the gospel is faith in the
      Lord Jesus Christ. Saving faith centers in the Savior and through Him in the Father (Bruce
      R. McConkie, <span style="text-decoration: underline">A New Witness for the Articles of
      Faith</span>, p. 164). The faith about which I speak today is focused upon and rooted in
      the Savior and Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Out of reverence and respect for the name of the Savior and to avoid the too frequent
      repetition of His name, please keep in mind that as I now use the word &quot;<em>faith</em>&quot;
      I am referring to the more accurate and complete phrase of &quot;<em>faith in the Lord
      Jesus Christ</em>.&quot; </p>
<p align="center"><strong>What is faith? </strong></p>
<p>Let us begin by first asking the question, what is faith? The Prophet Joseph Smith
      taught that faith is &quot; . . . <em>the first principle in revealed religion, and the
      foundation of all righteousness . . .</em>&quot; (Lecture 1, p. 31, 		<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Lectures On Faith In Historical Perspective</span>,
      Brigham Young University: Religious Studies Center, 1990).</p>
<p>One of the clearest and most concise definitions of the principle of faith is provided
      in the New Testament by Paul in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, verse one: &quot;<em>Now
      faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen</em>.&quot; We
      should note here that the Prophet Joseph in his translation of the New Testament changed
      the word &quot;<em>substance</em>&quot; in this verse to &quot;<em>assurance</em>.&quot;
      Thus, faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. The
      Prophet Joseph further commented on this definition of faith in Hebrews: 		</p>
<p><em>&quot;From this we learn that faith is the assurance which men have of the
          existence of things which they have not seen, and that it is also the principle of action
          in all intelligent beings&quot;</em> (Lecture&nbsp;1, p. 31).</p>
<p>Three key elements of faith, then, are highlighted in this verse from Hebrews and in
      the teachings of the Prophet Joseph: (1) faith is the assurance of things hoped for, (2)
      faith is the evidence of things not seen, and (3) faith is <strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">the</span></strong> principle of action in all
      intelligent beings.</p>
<p>Let me describe these three elements of faith in another way. Faith in the Savior
      simultaneously faces the future, looks to the past, and initiates action. 		</p>
<p>Faith as the substance or assurance of things hoped for faces the future. Please turn
      with me to Ether 3:9-11. In these verses the Lord is talking with the brother of Jared.</p>
<p><em>And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take
          upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as
          thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than
          this?</em></p>
<p><em>And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.</em></p>
<p><em>And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I				<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">shall</span></strong> speak?</em> (emphasis added)</p>
<p><br wp="BR1" />Please notice how the use of the word &quot;<em>shall</em>&quot; in verse eleven relates
      to the future. The Lord's question was not, &quot;<em>Believest thou the words which I		<strong>have</strong>
      spoken</em>?&quot; Rather, the brother of Jared was asked to confirm his confidence in
      that which the Lord would speak <strong>before it was spoken</strong>. Thus, this
      future-facing element of faith fosters hope for things not yet obtained and grants
      assurance that they ultimately will be. Faith is inextricably tied to and results in hope.
      Thus, faith in Christ always leads to hope in Christ. This hope is much more than worldly
      wishing; it is expectation, it is anticipation, and it is assurance. The future-facing
      aspect of faith is reflected in our personal lives by the fact that each of us here today
      hopes that through the atonement of Christ and the power of His resurrection we can be
      raised unto eternal life (Moroni 7:41). We also have faith and hope that each of us can be
      a member of a forever family. </p>
<p>Faith as the evidence of things not seen typically looks to the past. Truly, our
      confidence and trust in God are strengthened by examples and evidence of His influence in
      the past. This element of faith provides proof and confirmation that things unseen indeed
      are real. For example, many of our pioneer forefathers were protected, preserved, and
      strengthened in the most difficult and demanding of circumstances. The legacy of faith and
      testimony they left for us provides powerful evidence of things not seen. Similarly, a
      young missionary called to serve in a remote part of the world, and who may be
      understandably anxious about his or her service, is fortified by the faith-promoting
      experiences of family and friends who already have served as full-time missionaries in
      various parts of the world. </p>
<p>The combination of (1) future-facing hope and (2) evidence acquired through experience
      (3) produces action. Faith always is the beginning or origin of action. True faith always
      is manifest in faithfulness; this is why good works always flow from faith. As we read in
      James, &quot;<em>Faith without works is dead</em>&quot; (James 2:20).</p>
<p>Frequently, the words &quot;<em>faith</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>belief</em>&quot; are
      used interchangeably in our everyday conversations. However, the teachings of the Prophet
      Joseph highlight an essential distinction between these two concepts. Remember, he
      emphasized that &quot;<em>. . . faith is . . . the principle of action in all intelligent
      beings</em>&quot; (Lecture 1, p. 31). Belief, on the other hand, is defined in our modern
      dictionary as the &quot;<em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">mental</span></strong>
      acceptance of and conviction in the truth, actuality, or validity of something</em>&quot;
      (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The American Heritage College Dictionary</span>,
      p. 125, emphasis added). A belief is simply anything we mentally or intellectually accept
      as true. For example, we believe and accept as true the nature of the Godhead as taught by
      the Prophet Joseph Smith. We believe and accept as true the restoration of the gospel in
      its fullness in these latter days. And, most importantly, we believe and accept as true
      the reality of the atoning sacrifice of the Redeemer. In summary then, belief is the
      mental and intellectual acknowledgment, acceptance, and assent that something is true.
      Belief requires only the mind.</p>
<p>Faith grows out of and builds upon belief and produces action. Faith is not merely a
      positive mental attitude, or a strong will, or a Pollyanna-like approach to significant
      personal and public problems. A big &quot;happy face&quot; on our bathroom mirror is not
      an indictor of great faith. Please consider again the explanation by the Prophet Joseph
      Smith: &quot;<em>. . . faith is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the principle of action in all intelligent
      beings</em>&quot; (Lecture 1, p. 31).</p>
<p>Faith is evidenced in deeds. And as faith is the principle of action, so the opposite
      of faith, which we typically refer to as doubt, is the principle of inaction. Thus, if you
      and I have faith in Christ, we accept and <strong>live</strong> His teachings and we
      accept and <strong>obey</strong> His commandments. If you and I have faith in Christ, we
      strive to <strong>live</strong> worthily and <strong>seek</strong> for the companionship
      of the Holy Ghost, we <strong>repent</strong> of our sins, we <strong>minister</strong> to
      the poor and needy, we carefully <strong>listen</strong> to and <strong>apply</strong> the
      teachings of the living prophets, and we <strong>do</strong> the works of righteousness.
      Faith in prayer is evidenced in part when we <strong>kneel down</strong>. More
      importantly, however, faith is reflected when we <strong>get up</strong> and 		<strong>work
      diligently</strong> to accomplish that for which we have prayed. The true exercise of
      faith in prayer begins when we say, &quot;amen.&quot; Whereas belief requires only the
      mind, faith ultimately requires all of our mind and all of our heart and all of our might
      and all of our strength.</p>
<p>Consider the children of Israel as they were transporting the ark of the covenant under
      the leadership of Joshua. This story of faith is found in the third chapter of the book of
      Joshua. The Israelites came to the River Jordan and were promised that the waters would
      part, or &quot;<em>stand upon an heap</em>&quot; as described in verse 13, and that they
      would be able to cross over on dry ground. Interestingly, the waters did not part as the
      children of Israel stood on the banks of the river and waited for something to happen;
      rather, the soles of their feet were wet before the water was parted. The faith of the
      Israelites was manifested in the fact that they walked into the water 		<strong>before</strong>
      it parted. They walked into the River Jordan with a future-facing assurance of things
      hoped for. As the Israelites moved forward, the water parted; and as they crossed over on
      dry land, they also were able to look back and behold the evidence of things not seen.</p>
<p>We all need to remember that faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the
      evidence of things not seen. As President Boyd K. Packer has taught: </p>
<p><em>Faith, to be faith, must center around something that is not known. Faith, to be
          faith, must go beyond that for which there is confirming evidence. Faith, to be faith,
          must go into the unknown. Faith, to be faith, must walk to the edge of the light, and then
          a few steps into the darkness. If everything has to be known, if everything has to be
          explained, if everything has to be certified, then there is no need for faith. Indeed,
          there is no room for it.</em> (Elder Boyd K. Packer, &quot;What is Faith,&quot; 				<span style="text-decoration: underline">Faith</span>, Deseret Book Company, 1983, p. 42)</p>
<p>I now want to briefly emphasize four fundamental truths about faith</p>
<p align="center"><strong>No. 1 -- We receive no witness or evidence until after the trial
      of our faith. </strong></p>
<p>The tendency of the natural man or woman in each of us is to expect first the evidence
      of faith before we receive and act upon the assurance. This false pattern is summarized in
      the statements of individuals who say: &quot;Show me a sign, and I will believe&quot; or
      &quot;Explain the reasons, and then I will follow.&quot; The Lord's pattern, however, is
      quite different. Seeing is not believing; rather, believing is seeing. Now, this afternoon
      we have already reviewed several examples of the Lord's pattern of belief and faith that
      leads to seeing and acting, i.e., the brother of Jared and the Israelites at the River
      Jordan. But I imagine many of you may be like me; I would rather have the evidence before
      I act. President Packer's description of walking to the edge of the light and then a few
      steps into the darkness is most vivid. Imagine a beam of light that surrounds us. God
      instructs, &quot;Take a step into the darkness,&quot; and we respond, &quot;First, move
      the light and then I will take the step.&quot; God instructs again, &quot;You take the
      step and then the light will move.&quot; Faith <em>is</em> the assurance that precedes the
      act which ultimately yields the evidence.</p>
<p>As we walk to the edge of the light, I testify and promise that the light will move.
      When I was your age and wondering some of the exact same things that you are now
      wondering, I never would have imagined that someday Sister Bednar and I would be at Ricks
      College serving as we are now serving. I know the light moves as we walk in faith to the
      edge of the light. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>No. 2 -- Faith is a gift from God. </strong> </p>
<p>Faith is not a trait to be developed nor a reward to be earned. Rather, it is a gift we
      receive from God. Scriptural synonyms for faith include trust, confidence, and reliance.
      Thus, the spiritual gift of faith enables us to trust in Christ and to have confidence in
      His power to cleanse, renew, and redeem us. Faith means we are beginning to rely upon His
      merits, mercy, and grace (2 Nephi 2:8; 31:19; Moroni 6:4). Indeed you and I have a
      responsibility to appropriately seek after this gift, and we must do all that we can do to
      qualify for the gift of faith. Ultimately, however, the gift is bestowed upon us by a
      loving and caring God. Elder James E. Talmage indicated in his classic book,		<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Articles of Faith</span>, that faith is a gift from
      God:</p>
<p><em>Though within the reach of all who diligently strive to gain it, faith is
          nevertheless a divine gift, and can be obtained only from God (Matthew 16:17; John 6:44,
          65; Ephesians 2:8; 1 Corinthians 12:9; Romans&nbsp;12:3; Moroni&nbsp;10:11). As is fitting
          for so priceless a pearl, it is given to those only who show by their sincerity that they
          are worthy of it, and who give promise of abiding by its dictates. Although faith is
          called the first principle of the Gospel of Christ, though it be in fact the foundation of
          all religion, yet even faith is preceded by sincerity of disposition and humility of soul,
          whereby the word of God may make an impression upon the heart (Romans 10:17). No
          compulsion is used in bringing men to a knowledge of God; yet, as fast as we open our
          hearts to the influences of righteousness, the faith that leads to life eternal will be
          given us of our Father.</em> (p. 107)</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith also has taught:</p>
<p><em>Faith is always a gift from God to man, which is obtained by obedience as all other
          blessings are . . . . faith does not come without works; faith does not come without
          obedience to the commandments of God</em>. (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Gospel
          Doctrine</span>, pp.&nbsp;212-213)<br wp="BR2" /></p>
<p>May I simply suggest that young people of your age can and will and do receive this
      supernal gift. You need not be called to a visible or responsible position in the Church
      and you do not have to be &quot;old&quot; to qualify for this gift. An 18-year-old student
      at Ricks College can and should be blessed with great faith.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>No. 3 -- Obedience strengthens faith; sin and wickedness
      diminish faith.</strong> </p>
<p>The Holy Ghost delivers the spiritual gift of faith. Obedience and righteousness invite
      the companionship of the third member of the Godhead. Sin and wickedness repulse the Holy
      Ghost and make it impossible for him to deliver spiritual gifts. Can you begin to see why
      our covenant to obey the commandments and our commitment to live in accordance with the
      honor and dress codes are so important? The standards at Ricks College are really not
      about hemlines and hairstyles; rather, they are about honor and integrity and inviting the
      companionship of the Holy Ghost to bestow upon us the gift of faith.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>No. 4 -- Faith typically is evident over time in many small
      events and things rather than in a few big events and things. </strong> </p>
<p>We frequently think of faith in connection with mighty and miraculous events such as
      moving mountains and parting seas and raising the dead. It is important to remember,
      though, that faith typically is evident in many small events and things rather than in a
      few big events and things. It is also true that faith usually is bestowed upon us a little
      bit at a time rather than all at once--line upon line and precept upon precept.</p>
<p>Have you and I ever been frustrated in our efforts to exercise faith in prayer because
      we expect a &quot;big&quot; answer, and we expect it &quot;now&quot;? We may mistakenly
      conclude that because no answer came in the first few moments after saying
      &quot;amen&quot; that our prayer was not heard or that no answer was given. An answer to a
      prayer frequently is made up of many small answers given over a period of time--line upon
      line and precept upon precept. And I have also learned that those small answers almost
      always come as I am working to accomplish the things for which I have prayed. I may first
      receive a small prompting of assurance to proceed in a particular direction, then a small
      nudge to adjust my course, and finally a growing confidence and confirmation that the
      pathway I am pursuing is in accordance with the will of the Lord. Answers often come
      gradually and are more like dew distilling from heaven than a sudden flash flood. 		</p>
<p>My faith in the Savior and His atonement has come from countless small and seemingly
      insignificant conversations with members of the Church who have felt of His redeeming
      love. I, too, have felt that love. But I personally have not had a singular and defining
      experience that is the foundation of my faith. Rather, my faith is strengthened by a
      diligent home teacher who shared with me the experience of being prompted to say just the
      right thing at just the right time to assist a family in need, by a Sunday School teacher
      who excitedly described and testified about the experience of teaching by the Spirit a
      group of young men and young women, and by the missionary who acted upon a simple feeling
      that resulted in finding and teaching a golden investigator. Brothers and sisters, can you
      tell that in these simple experiences I am talking about you? I want you to leave this
      devotional assembly today with the assurance that you have faith and have experienced the
      blessings of faith. Remember, faith is evident over time in many small events and things
      rather than in a few big events and things.</p>
<p>I conclude with an experience Sister Bednar and I had with President and Sister
      Hinckley. We were eating dinner together at a banquet in Salt Lake City shortly after
      President Hinckley had returned from a demanding international trip. During the course of
      our conversation I asked President Hinckley this question, &quot;President, given your
      travel schedule and the demands of your office, how do you keep up?&quot; He smiled warmly
      and responded, &quot;David, I do not keep up. I travel through so many time zones that
      when I am supposed to be wide awake, I am sleepy. When I am supposed to be sleepy, I am
      wide awake. The paperwork and other demands in the office are never ending.&quot; He then
      smiled and said something I will never forget: &quot;But, David, I just keep going.&quot;
      Can you and I hear and recognize and feel the faith in that answer by the President of the
      Church. When he is tired, he just keeps going. When circumstances look difficult and even
      discouraging, he just keeps going. Regardless of the challenge, he just keeps going. In
      light of this episode with President Hinckley, please consider again the statement by the
      Prophet Joseph Smith: &quot;<em>. . . faith is . . . the principle of action in all
      intelligent beings</em>&quot; (Lecture 1, p. 31).</p>
<p>I know and testify that God the Eternal Father and His Beloved Son live. I know that
      faith in the Savior is a gift from God and a principle of action. I also know we can be
      blessed with this gift as we make and keep sacred covenants and are obedient. That we may
      diligently and properly seek for this sacred gift is my prayer, in the name of Jesus
      Christ, amen.</p>

<p>	On Sunday afternoons when Elder Bednar is not out of town on a stake conference

assignment, we like to go tracting in your dorms and apartments.  We show up at an apartment

complex, knock on the door, and invite ourselves in.  Some of you know who we are.  Others

don't.  But we enjoy this activity, and it's a great way to get to know you better.  </p>
<p>	When we go, we sometimes see young men, all decked out in their Sunday duds,

strolling from apartment to apartment to check out the young women.  They're also subtly

hunting for dinner invitations as well.  So ladies, BEWARE.</p>
<p>	Some students don't let us in.  They carefully peer through the mini blinds, discover

it's us, and then pretend they're not home.</p>
<p>	Some scurry to clean up their messes, while others try to quickly hang up a picture of

the temple and take down the picture of Hollywood "hottie," Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>	Some are embarrassed about their dress.  One young woman kept grabbing pillows

from the couch to cover her skimpy tank top.  Thank goodness the couch had pillows.</p>
<p>	So, as you can see, Sunday has been an interesting day.</p>
<p>	Why do we have Sunday?  You've all read why in the pamphlet <em>For the Strength of

Youth</em>:  "The Lord has given the Sabbath day for your benefit and has commanded you to keep

it holy.  On this sacred, holy day, worship the Lord, strengthen family relationships, help

others, and draw close to the Lord" (p. 16).</p>
<p>	Keeping the Sabbath day holy is a sign to the Lord that we want to be his people (see

Exodus 31:13-17).  We have six days to work our own agenda.  The Lord asks us to set aside

one day each week to renew ourselves spiritually.  The Sabbath is a constant reminder that our

spiritual minds and bodies need nourishing too.</p>
<p>	Many years ago I read a quote about keeping the Sabbath day holy that cut to the center

of my heart.  I've never forgotten it.  May I share it with you?</p>
<p>	Elder Mark E. Petersen said:  "Our observance or nonobservance of the Sabbath is an

unerring measure of our attitude toward the Lord personally and toward his suffering in

Gethsemane, his death on the cross, and his resurrection from the dead.  It is a sign of whether

we are Christians in very deed, or whether our conversion is so shallow that commemoration

of his atoning sacrifice means little or nothing to us" (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, April 1975, p. 72;

or <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, May 1975, p. 49).</p>
<p>	As we have attended your meetings and visited your apartments, we have learned that

Sabbath worship and Sunday behavior is different for everyone.  We are all in different places

on the spectrum.  See which of these situations describes you.</p>
<p>	Some stay in church dress all day; some change into grubbies the minute church is

over.</p>
<p>	Some listen to quiet hymns; others crank up their stereos as loud as they will go.</p>
<p>	Some study scriptures, write in their journals, or go home and visiting teaching; others

nap all afternoon.</p>
<p>	Some drive to the video store to rent movies because they are bored.</p>
<p>	Some do their duty at church and become active and involved in their campus wards;

others leave Ricks College every weekend to go home and miss out on the total campus

experience.</p>
<p>	Some arrive early to church, sit and meditate before the meeting starts, and prepare

themselves spiritually to take the sacrament; others trickle in late, or completely miss the

sacrament portion of the meeting.</p>
<p>	Some wear Sunday best to meetings; others dress extremely casual.</p>
<p>	Some attend the Church Educational System (CES) firesides for college-age, young

adults once a month to hear the counsel of apostles and prophets; others stay home to watch

television or do homework.</p>
<p>	This list of differences could go on and on.  As I said in the beginning, we are all in a

different place on the spectrum.</p>
<p>	But since reading the words of Elder Petersen, I have asked myself the question:  Does

my preparation for the sacrament, my dress, the music I listen to, and my Sunday activity

reflect my appreciation of the Savior's sacrifice for me?  Am I truly converted?</p>
<p>I find it interesting that one of the biggest issues facing mainline religion 
today is style of worship and what style of dress should go with it</p>
<p>	Let me share the content of some brochures I received in the mail several years ago

inviting me to attend a church in the community where I lived.</p>
<p>It's not a "Leave it to Beaver" world anymore where everyone dresses

up on Sunday morning and goes to church.  If you don't like the dressing up

part, we understand.  That's why there's a place for you.  It's a place where

people meet in a relaxed, casual atmosphere for encouragement and support.

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  And if you're not too thrilled with organ music, you just may love the

sound of the contemporary music. . . .  You can relax.  You won't be preached

at, but you will hear positive, sometimes humorous messages which offer solid

solutions to everyday problems.  The Sunday service begins at 10:30&nbsp;a.m. and

you'll be out long before noon.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably saying, "Where is that church.  That sounds good to me!"

Needless to say, I don't think The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is trying to

attract members in this way.  And I'm glad.</p>
<p>	Every Sunday we have the opportunity to partake of the emblems of the sacrament,

administered to us by those holding the holy priesthood.  Those of you who prepare, bless,

and pass the sacrament have a duty to dress and look your best so that nothing about your

appearance detracts from this sacred ordinance.  We who attend must also dress in our best

attire to show respect for the Savior whom we worship.</p>
<p>Do you understand why we, as members of the Church, need to safeguard the dignity

and sanctity of our meetings by the way we dress, the hymns we sing, and the doctrines we

discuss?  Casual worship breeds casual commitment.  And casual commitment to Christ is not

true worship.</p>
<p>To me, Sabbath day observance isn't about being casual, comfortable, and

contemporary.  It's about covenants, commitments, and conversion.  Proper preparation

<strong>before</strong> attending our sacrament meetings, reverently and worthily partaking of the sacrament

<strong>during</strong> our meetings, and wise and prudent use of our time <strong>after</strong> our meetings will bring a

fullness of joy to our lives.  Individual and collective blessings will come to us as a body of

Saints here at Ricks College if we keep the Sabbath day holy as we have been commanded. 

May we have the courage to evaluate our Sunday behavior and the faith to change and

improve.</p>
<p>In closing, let me share one last thought with you.  Before our son Jeffrey left for

college last week, I told him that nothing would please me more than if he would use the time

he had on Sunday wisely.  Like many of you, Jeff is striving to become a missionary.  We

talked of all he could learn about the Savior and His teachings if he applied his heart and soul

to serious gospel study on Sundays during this coming school year.  Like Jeff, many of you

are preparing to go through the temple before you serve as a missionary.  If I had $100,000 to

spare, I would buy each of you a copy of <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Holy Temple</span> written by President Boyd K.

Packer.  I would encourage you to read and study that book on Sunday so you would go to the

temple prepared.  The advance preparation would enable you to have a special, first-time

experience.  I'd ask those of you who have already been endowed to read it, too, so you would

be renewed in your commitment to keep your covenants.</p>
<p>The principle of keeping the Sabbath day holy is true.  Blessings await those who have

the courage to follow this commandment.  I bear witness of the Savior and his redeeming

sacrifice.  Our joy will be full if we have the desire to remember the Sabbath day and keep it

holy.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left">My dear young friends it is a pleasure to be here with you today. Thank
    you for the warm welcome and for the beautiful prayer at the beginning of this session. I
    sincerely pray that the Spirit of the Lord will direct my thinking and speaking, and your
    listening and heeding so that we may all be edified together.</p>
<p align="left">You are a special group of
    our Father's children. I am confident He desires that you experience happiness and success
    in your journey through life. My message today is about <b>Happiness</b>.</p>
<p align="left">Everyone desires to be happy. Happiness does not come without personal effort and the
    availability of truth. How do we find happiness in our time which is full of stress and
    challenge? </p>
<p align="left">Years ago the Prophet Alma counseled his son, Helaman, to give heed to the word of
    Christ, for it would point him in a straight course to <b><i>eternal bliss.</i></b> He
    promised Helaman that "the way is prepared, and if we will look we may live
    forever" in the state of happiness. Helaman was then told to <u>take care of sacred
    things</u>, "that he might look to God and live." If he followed the course
    outlined by the words of Christ he would be led "into a far better land of
    promise." (See Alma 37.) So it is with us as it was with Helaman.</p>
<p align="left">Sometime ago I was assigned to a stake conference in San Diego, California. When I
    arrived in the air terminal lounge my eyes scanned the waiting crowd to find the stake
    president. Finally I spied a man whom I thought must be him. He was dressed in a dark suit
    and tie on a hot Saturday afternoon. He was smiling and his eyes met mine with a knowing
    look. As I reached out my hand to his I asked, "How are you, President?" His
    response was a quick and pleasant, "I'm happy!" At the time I thought how
    appropriate his reply had been. We walked to his car and headed for the stake center and
    the Saturday meetings of the conference.</p>
<p align="left">All day I noticed that he gave the same response to every one who inquired about 'how
    he was,' "I'm happy!"</p>
<p align="left">That evening as he and I were traveling to his home, he interrupted the silence with
    this statement: "Elder Pinegar, you want to ask me a question." I asked what he
    had in mind. He responded by stating that I wanted to know why he said, "I'm
    happy" to every inquiry about how he was doing. I admitted that the question had been
    on my mind and invited him to explain. He told me the following experience from his life
    as a young missionary.</p>
<p align="left">When the stake president had entered the mission field he informed his mission
    president that he didn't want to be on a mission and asked to be released and sent home.
    The mission president replied that he could not release the young missionary because he
    was not the one who had called him; he had been called by the Lord. The missionary would
    need to stay until the Lord released him. The young man decided to stay, but each time he
    met or wrote to the mission president he included a request to be released, to be able to
    return home.</p>
<p align="left">Several months had passed and still the request persisted. One afternoon following a
    Zone Conference and interview the missionary was surprised to hear the mission president
    say, "Okay, Elder, today you are going home. Pack your bags. You can go with me when
    I leave today."</p>
<p align="left">The young Elder was very happy. He went to his apartment, gathered his things, bid his
    companion and one of the Assistants goodbye and rode away with the mission president. He
    repeatedly told the president how happy this was making him to be able to go home. The
    mission president then said something like this: </p>
<p align="left">"Elder you <b>are</b> going home, I'm taking you to <b>my</b> home. I'm turning
    you over to my wife!."</p>
<p align="left">The missionary quickly responded that he did not want to go to the mission home, he
    wanted to go to his own home. The mission president did not give in, he merely drove to
    the mission home where his wife was waiting for them.</p>
<p align="left">As the dejected missionary got out of the car and approached the door of the mission
    home, the mission president's wife came out. She had a warm smile on her face and reached
    for his hand with a kind word and asked, "How are you Elder?" He quickly
    responded that he was not happy and wanted to go to his own home. This wonderfully sweet
    lady said, "Wrong answer Elder. Now look at me. Smile, and say, 'I'm happy!'"
    With a half hearted smile, and head bowed he said, "I'm happy." She smiled even
    more warmly and said she was glad to know he was happy. The young Elder quickly followed
    with the reply that he was not happy and wanted to go home, to which she responded,
    "Wrong answer. Now look at me, smile and say, 'I'm happy.'" He obeyed but not
    with any enthusiasm. They went inside the mission home where she had a nice meal awaiting
    them after which the missionary retired to a bedroom for the night.</p>
<p align="left">For the next four days and nights the "I'm happy" conversation took place
    every time the president's wife and the young missionary met. On the fourth night as the
    Elder walked down the hall of the mission home he saw the president's wife approaching and
    he knew what was certain to happen. He decided to surprise her. When she reached out her
    hand in greeting, he smiled and responded with, "I'm happy!" He couldn't help
    giving a genuine smile. She was so pleased that she said, "Right answer, Elder. Now
    you are ready to go back to work." He quickly stated that he didn't want to go back
    to work, he was not really happy and only wanted to go back to his home. </p>
<p align="left">The mission president's wife then invited the young missionary to listen to her
    counsel. She knew he thought by going home, by getting away from the hard work and
    responsibility of his mission, he would be happy. She reminded him that he had every
    blessing that would lead to happiness because he had been taught the Gospe</p>
<p align="left">Happiness. There is no other way to find happiness than through Jesus Christ and His
    atoning sacrifice. He has prepared the way for all mankind to become happy through
    obedience to the truth; through the promise of forgiveness upon the conditions of
    repentance and obedience to the commandments of the Savior. She also reminded the
    missionary that the Holy Priesthood of God has been restored to the earth and that the
    keys of its power rests in living prophets and apostles who lead and guide us and serve as
    His witnesses in the earth. Through these keys of the priesthood, power has been given to
    bind husband and wife, children and ancestors together on earth and they would be bound in
    heaven. This plan of happiness was the very message the young missionary was called to
    teach. </p>
<p align="left">This young missionary was humbled as he realized how very blessed he was to know of our
    Father's Plan of Salvation. He made a promise at that time that he would never complain
    again but would pursue the prepared path to happiness with renewed faith and
    determination. He went back to his labors and completed a successful, happy missionary
    service. From that time to the present, a period of over 37 years, he had always responded
    with "I'm happy!" to those who ask how he is doing.</p>
<p align="left">I know something of this man. Life for him has not been easy. Many challenges have come
    his way, but happiness has accompanied him throughout his life because he has come to
    understand and pursue the Lord's plan of happiness, the path He has prepared for us..</p>
<p align="left">The Prophet Joseph Smith has said:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be
        the end thereof, <b>if we pursue the path that leads to it;</b> He defined the path as: 
					<b>virtue,
        uprightness, faithfulness, holiness and keeping the commandments of God."</b></i></p>
<p align="left">It is our challenge and opportunity to pursue these qualities along our life's path. To
    pursue means to follow so as to overtake or capture; to strive to accomplish; to be
    engaged in an effort to obtain the desired objective. (See <i>"The American Heritage
    Dictionary," </i>1994.) To me this means that we can obtain the qualities of
    happiness spoken of by Joseph Smith through personal desire and effort.</p>
<p align="left">I am going to talk about these qualities. </p>
<p align="left">First, <b>VIRTUE:</b> When one thinks of virtue it may be in terms of purity, moral
    excellence and righteousness. Virtue is an essential quality of the happy, righteous
    person, "for often the words of truth seem hard against all uncleanness, but the
    righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken." (See 2 Nephi
    9:40.)</p>
<p align="left">The dictionary also states that virtue is "an effective force or power to produce
    a definite result." (By virtue of. . . .) This part of the definition is wonderfully
    illustrated by the experience of the Savior and the woman with an "issue of
    blood" which had been going on for about 12 years. As the Savior was teaching in a
    certain place a woman made her way forward and touched the hem of Jesus's garment.
    Immediately she was healed. The Savior asked his disciples who had touched him. The
    disciples were astounded at Jesus' request for there was the press of a crowd about Him.
    The Savior responded that "virtue" (power) had "gone out of him." The
    woman, fearing that what she had done would bring reproach or rebuke, came forward and
    told what she had done. The Savior responded that the woman's faith had made her whole.
    The power of faith to be healed had drawn upon the power of the Savior's virtue and the
    miracle was accomplished.</p>
<p align="left">The Topical Guide in our Scriptures gives us these words as 
	they relate to virtue: Chastity, Cleanliness, Goodness, Holiness, Modesty, 
	Strength. On this occasion, strength to heal had 'gone out' of the Savior. 
	He knew the potency of such power when exercised with faith. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Brigham Young said of virtue:</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Treasure up in your hearts that which tends to virtue. . . .
        Learn the will of God, keep His commandments and do His will, and you will be a virtuous
        person. Can you understand that? If you can know the will of God and do it, you will be a
        virtuous person."</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>President Gordon B. Hinckley recently declared:</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Believe in virtue. Believe in cleanliness of thought, mind, word
        and deed."</i> </p>
<p align="left">He then gave us specific counsel and warning about safeguarding virtue:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"Stay away from the great and terrible flood of pornography that
        is sweeping across the earth and makes a few men rich while it destroys many others who
        become enslaved to it. Stay away from it."</i></p>
<p align="left">I would add, safeguard your virtue by avoiding fashions which trend toward immodesty.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Joseph F. Smith</b> has counseled us:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"Personal purity and proper thoughts . . . are the basis of all
        proper action. . . . There appears to be a something beyond and above the reasons apparent
        to the human mind why Chastity brings strength and power to the peoples of the earth, but
        it is so. . . .We desire. . .to emphasize the enormity of sexual sins. Though often
        regarded as insignificant by those not knowing the will of God, they are, in his eyes an
        abomination, and if we re to remain his favored people they must be shunned as the gates
        of hell. The evil results of these sins re so patent in vice, crime, misery and disease
        that it would appear that all, young and old, must perceive and sense them. They are
        detroying the world. If we are to be preserved we must abhor them, shun them, not practice
        the least of them, for they weaken and enervate, they kill man spiritually, they make him
        unfit for the company of the righteous and the presence of God." </i>
<small></small><small></small><small></small><small>(Gospel
        Doctrine, 275-76.)</small></p>
<p align="left">I believe virtue to also be an attitude, a condition of the soul. A loss of virtue is
    not a sudden action. It comes gradually when one allows unclean thoughts and images to
    enter our mind. When we are tempted to abandon the standard of virtue, even at the
    smallest first step, we should stop and turn to the Lord for help. He has promised that He
    will help us find a way to escape such temptations.</p>
<p align="left"><em>"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man; but God is
    faithful, whowill not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the
    temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to beat it." </em>(1
    Corinthians 10:13)</p>
<p align="left">The Lord has promised: "<i>I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out
    of temptation."</i> (D&amp;C 95:1)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Kristen's Story</b></p>
<p align="left">When one of my daughters was the age of many of you, she had an experience which has
    helped our family have faith that the Lord will provide the help we need to escape when we
    desire to maintain the standards of virtue He has set. Here is her story as she recorded
    it for me:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, my friends came to get me (on a beautiful summer
        night) to go to the canyon for a barbecue.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unfortunately</b>, after the barbecue, my friends suggested we go to someone's condo
        in Park City to watch a particular movie. It was a movie that I had decided beforehand I
        would never watch. Uh-oh, I thought. What will I do now?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, I had to be home by midnight and I told my friends I would have to
        go home.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unfortunately</b>, this plea didn't phase the driver of the car, who took Parley's
        Canyon exit, and away we went (to Park City.) I knew I would need some help out of this
        situation so I offered a silent prayer. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, when we arrived at the condo, the boy, whose parents owned it,
        realized he didn't have the key with him-we were locked out! I was relieved, thinking my
        prayer had been answered and we would now have to go home.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unfortunately</b>, his date shimmied up through a second-story window and let us in
        the house. Uh-oh, I thought.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, when we got inside, there was no VCR. Someone in the boy's family
        had borrowed it. I was relieved, thinking my prayer had been answered and we'd have to go
        home.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unfortunately</b>, we piled back into the car and drove to the nearest video store
        where the boys rented a video machine. Uh-oh, I thought.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, when we got back to the condo and they started to set up the
        machine, they realized they had not been given a cable for hooking up the video player. I
        was relieved, thinking my prayer had been answered and we would have to go home.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unfortunately</b>, they were still not ready to give up. One of the boys went back
        to the video store to pick up the missing cable. He returned and they were acting
        triumphant after finally overcoming all the obstacles of the evening. I placed myself in
        the far corner of the room wondering what to do. It seemed inevitable that the movie was
        going to be shown. I continued to pray.</p>
<p align="left">Then as the rented cable was connected to the rented VCR. An electric shock and hot
        sparks sent one of the boys flying across the room. The rest of us fell silent. That boy,
        looking dazed, said, "Someone doesn't want us to watch this movie!"</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, without another word, we all piled in the car, returned the video
        player and movie, and headed for home. I was greatly relieved, knowing my prayers had been
        answered.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, I learned that when you decide to do something the Lord would have
        you do, He finds a way to help you keep your word-commitment. I had made the decision to
        do right and I asked Him for His help. He honored that decision and provided the help I
        needed.</p>
<p align="left">And, <b>Fortunately</b>, she had called her mother to explain why she would be late,
        and <b>Fortunately</b>, her mother had been praying for her also.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fortunately</b>, for you and me, the Lord's standard of 
					<b>virtue</b> 
            provides protection, spiritual and physical strength to those who 
            honor it. Virtue is a great source of happiness.</p>
<p align="left"><b>UPRIGHTNESS </b>is the next standard along the path to<b> happiness</b> named by the
    Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
<p align="left">In the Spring of 1999 following a devastating tornado in Oklahoma, I made a visit to
    assess the damages and to offer Church Welfare support to the Oklahoma Saints and others
    for whom I have responsibility as their Area President. I was shocked and saddened to see
    homes and businesses in ruin and rubble; vehicles demolished and strewn about; trees and
    shrubbery uprooted. Much of the ground in the path of the tornado was absolutely barren
    with even the sod torn away.</p>
<p align="left">At the same time I saw something that gave me hope and confidence. I saw people
    undaunted, courageously picking up the pieces of their lives and their property; people
    helping one another; people sharing what little they had salvaged with those who had lost
    everything. A headline in a local newspaper described what I saw:</p>
<p><b>NOTHING LEFT STANDING BUT THE PEOPLE !</b></p>
<p align="left">The people indeed were standing firm with personal strength and the courage born of
    faith in God. They were sharing and smiling. They were upright and upbeat ! They had
    placed American flags on top piles of rubble; A sign on a totally destroyed home read:
    "In God we trust."</p>
<p align="left">In Proverbs 10:9, we read, "He that <b>walketh uprightly</b> walketh surely."</p>
<p align="left">When we pursue a life of uprightness on our walk up the path to happiness we will walk
    surely and safely. We will walk with integrity and honesty. Brigham :Young taught that
    true happiness can come only on the basis of personal honesty.</p>
<p align="left">Jason Turley was an all-American baseball player in High School. His prowess as a
    pitcher had captured the attention of several professional teams. He told those who showed
    an interest in him that he had a few conditions regarding his signing with any team: (1)
    he would need time off to serve a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of
    Latter-day Saints before beginning with the team, (2) he would not play on Sunday. The
    Houston Astros selected Turley and approached him with a contract which included Jason's
    special conditions of employment.</p>
<p align="left">At the signing ceremony, with the press and Astros' management present, everything went
    smoothly. The owner of the Astros Baseball Club, however, approached Turley's father with
    a question: "Surely Jason does not expect us to meet everything he has requested in
    his contract, does he? After all, we have given him a large bonus for signing with
    us."</p>
<p align="left">Jason's father told the manager he would have to work that out with his son, but he
    should expect Jason to hold to the original contract. When the Astros' owner approached
    young Jason Turley and asked him the same question: Did he really expect the Astros' to
    allow him to serve a mission before he began to play? Jason did not hesitate to say that
    they could take the bonus and tear up the contract if there were any doubts that he would
    be allowed to serve the mission first. The Astros' owner quickly responded that he would
    honor the contract as written and that it would be a credit to their club to have a young
    man of such integrity on the team.</p>
<p align="left">Incidentally, when the mission call came for Jason it was to Houston, Texas, the home
    of the Astros. </p>
<p align="left">A <b>third standard</b> we are to pursue along the path to happiness is <b>FAITHFULNESS.
    </b></p>
<p align="left">One of my favorite scriptures is found in Doctrine and Covenants 103:36:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your
        diligence,<b>faithfulness</b>, and prayers of faith."</i></p>
<p align="left">Commitment, courage, dedication, dependability, loyalty, obedience, perseverance,
    steadfastness, trustworthiness, worthiness- these are all words in the Topical Guide that
    describe the attribute of <b>faithfulness.</b></p>
<p align="left">A person who is faithful is true to God, to himself/herself, and to his fellow man. He
    can be relied upon to do what is expected of him. He acts with full integrity of his own
    free will without coercion or force. He will stay true in times of trial and difficulty;
    through disappointments and challenges. He will cling to hope and go forward with
    confidence in the Lord.</p>
<p align="left">Recently, while touring a mission, I met with missionaries which demonstrated many
    examples of faithfulness and all that the word implies. One of the missionaries is Elder
    Brad Bagan. He is a quadriplegic. He was injured playing in a neighborhood football game.
    He has very limited use of his hands. With great determination and persistence he has
    developed the ability to stand with a walker and pull himself along for short distances.
    He is a successful and <u>happy</u> missionary and an example of faithfulness to all the
    missionaries and members in that mission, and to all others who know him. He speaks with
    boldness and love. The companions who serve with him come to realize that if he, with all
    of his personal challenges, can successfully and cheerfully do missionary work they have
    no reason or excuse to keep from laboring themselves with all their heart, might, mind and
    strength.</p>
<p align="left">Through his demonstration of faithfulness he has shown many the way to victory on the
    path of happiness.</p>
<p align="left">While this young elder was at the Missionary Training Center in Provo he had the
    opportunity to go the Provo Temple which is only a few blocks from the Missionary Training
    Center. Because of his severely debilitating physical condition it took him about two
    hours to make his arduous journey up the gently sloping hill to the temple on a very cold
    and windy day.</p>
<p align="left">When the MTC president learned about Elder Bagan's experience he felt very sad and told
    the Elder he would have been happy to provide transportation for him. Elder Bagan's
    response was impressive. He told the President not to worry or be concerned about what had
    happened. "It was worth it."</p>
<p align="left">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the pursuit of <b>Holiness also </b>keeps us on
    the pathway to happiness. The temple is a place of holiness and being worthy to enter
    there is essential to our eternal happiness. Whatever effort is required of us to go there
    will indeed be "worth it."</p>
<p align="left">While in Houston recently I visited the temple during its "Open House"
    period. The project manager showed me the stone panel that had been set in place on the
    front of the edifice. Inscribed in the stone are the words: "Holiness To The
    Lord." These words can be found on every temple. </p>
<p align="left">It is sometimes hard to talk about ourselves in terms of Holiness. We can look to the
    temple for Holiness in the Lord.</p>
<p align="left">Temples stand as a symbols of our relationship and commitment to Heavenly Father and to
    His Son Jesus Christ, who are Holy. As we strive to be worthy to enter the House of the
    Lord we are striving to acquire the attribute of <b>holiness</b>. </p>
<p align="left">President Gordon B. Hinckley is determined to have more and more temples built
    throughout the world so that all members will have the opportunity to receive the
    blessings available in that Holy and sacred place. When he became president of the Church
    in 1995 there were 47 operating temples throughout the world. Today there are 99 dedicated
    temples with the 100<sup>th</sup> to be dedicated in a few days. </p>
<p align="left">President Hinckley has said:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"To every man and woman, to every boy and girl, prepare now to go
        to the House of the Lord. Let a resolution come into your heart that you will put your
        life in order and bring about such reformation as may be needed to qualify yourself to go
        to that beautiful House."</i></p>
<p align="left">The <b>Holy Ghost</b> helps us in our pursuit of holiness and happiness. It is a
    wondrous, amazing gift that we receive when we are confirmed members of the Church. We can
    walk in <b>holiness</b> on the pathway to happiness when we live worthy to have that
    Spirit with us. When we act according to the prompting of the Holy Ghost we are acting in <b>holiness</b>.</p>
<p align="left">The Holy Ghost acts as a cleansing agent to purify and to sanctify a person from all
    sin. The Holy Ghost witnesses to us the truth of all things. Knowing and following the
    truth brings the happiness found in freedom from doubt, freedom to act with confidence in
    what we do.</p>
<p align="left">My daughter, Amy, who, like you, is a college student, said the following in a talk she
    gave in her ward at Brigham Young University:</p>
<p align="left">In your temporal studies look for the spiritual truths. If we focus on truth, then it
    will expound our learning. By focusing where we should, we will see that all other things
    will fall into place. I am sure many of you have felt this same feeling before, but often
    I have been in a class and we will start to talk about something that rings really true,
    and the Spirit burns within me. (Sometimes I even start to cry!) The Spirit will testify
    truth to you if you are looking for it." </p>
<p align="left">As we pursue a life worthy of the Holy Ghost, a <b>holiness </b>will glow within us
    which will lead us and light up our pathway to happiness.</p>
<p align="left"><b>KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS</b></p>
<p align="left">The <b>final standard</b> the Lord gave us through Joseph Smith to mark our path in
    pursuit of happiness is to <b>keep all the commandments.</b></p>
<p align="left">While serving as a mission president I received a letter from a new missionary. He
    wrote something like this:</p>
<p align="left">"Dear President,</p>
<p align="left">Please send me a list of the <u>important rules</u>.
        My companion tells me we don't need to keep all the rules, only the <u>important ones</u>.
        Would you please send me a list of the <u>important ones</u>. Until you do, 
					<b>I intend to
        keep them all.</b></p>
<p align="left">With love,</p>
<p align="left">Elder (Straight)"</p>
<p align="left">The Lord has said that His gifts of the Spirit are for those who love Him and
    "keep all my commandments, and (for) him that seeketh so to do."(Doctrine and
    Covenants 46:9)</p>
<p align="left">As we pursue the path of happiness we want to also remember what Elder Joseph B.
    Wirthlin said in his talk to the Young Adults of the Church:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"Enjoy the journey!"</i> <br /><small>
</small><small></small><small>(Church Education System Fireside, 9 November 1999)</small></p>
<p align="left">It is easier to enjoy the journey when we are seeking to obey all of God's
    commandments. On our pathway through life we will not always find it easy to be happy.
    There are many obstacles to overcome and many hills to climb. We will find strength for
    the journey if we keep the commandments that will keep us from straying off our course. </p>
<p align="left">President Gordon B. Hinckley has quoted these words of newspaper columnist, Jenkins
    Lloyd Jones:</p>
<p align="left"><i>&quot;Life is like an old-time rail journey - 
					delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, 
					interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and 
					thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord 
					for letting you have the ride.&quot;</i></p>
<p align="left">President Hinckley added: </p>
<p align="left"><i>&quot;Be happy in that which you do.&quot;</i> </p>
<p align="left">Happiness in life comes, despite the hardships, the disappointments, our own
    weaknesses, and in association with our successes, when we truly understand our Heavenly
    Father's Plan of Happiness. He wants us to be happy. Who could be happier than we? - We
    who know the plan and purpose of life and have the assurance that we have a Savior, Jesus
    Christ, who has already completed the journey. He has promised that as we follow His path
    in the pursuit of <b>VIRTUE, UPRIGHTNESS, FAITHFULNESS, HOLINESS,</b> and as we strive to <b>KEEP
    ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD</b>, He will continue to guide us along the path and we will
    be happy.</p>
<p align="left">I bear witness that we are led by prophets of God; 
      that Jesus Christ is the Great Savior of our lives and is the author of 
      our salvation and happiness. He lives today, knows the path, and will 
      safely, and happily, guide us through. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, 
	amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I pray that my words can match my feelings for you. I love coming back to Rexburg and
    to you Ricks College students. We loved our seven years here. </p>
<p>I have watched you, and listened to you. I have walked in your Doc Martens--when I was
    one of you and when I was one of your teachers. I too left home to go off to college when
    I was 18--blinking in my contact lenses, trying to hide my bad case of acne. But my braces
    <em>were</em> finally gone so at least I had a wireless smile. That is if I could get up
    my courage to smile--especially at boys. I had not dated much at all in high school, and
    boys were still a mystery to me.</p>
<p>I was scared!&nbsp; Could I get good enough grades? Could I get along with my
    roommates? Would I have any dates, or would I be in my dorm room on Friday and Saturday
    nights counting the flowers on my bedspread? And besides all that, I was homesick. I'd
    have given anything to walk in the front door of my parents' house, hear my mom cheerfully
    call, "Marie, is that you?" and smell her spicy enchiladas warming in the oven.
    You know that feeling, don't you? You freshmen have been here just five weeks or so. Some
    of you are coming back to Ricks--sophomores and returned missionaries. This process of
    leaving home isn't as new to you now. But haven't you <em>all</em> found that it <em>is</em>
    time to leave home? It <em>is</em> time for new opportunities and new experiences; time to
    explore new freedoms. . . and, therefore, new choices. Time to discover new landscapes
    where you can grow like never before. </p>
<p>Like you returning missionaries, I had to leave home again, because of a call from the
    Prophet. Four years ago, my husband and I sat across the desk from President Hinckley. He
    said, "Brother Hafen, I would like to extend to you a call. Your first assignment
    will be to the Pacific Area. You will be living in Sydney, Australia." Then he turned
    to me and said, "How does that strike you, Sister Hafen?" To which I could only
    gasp, "President Hinckley, that <em>really</em> strikes me." He chuckled. I
    wept. I was NOT thinking of new landscapes of growth for me. All I could think of was how
    far away Australia was. (Yet now that I am barely back, the Olympics are just making me
    homesick.) Honestly, in some ways I didn't want to go. It meant leaving family, friends,
    and students. We would not be welcoming our son Mark, when he returned from his mission.
    We would not be decorating the Christmas tree with our youngest, Rachel--in her second
    year here at Ricks. I would be leaving my mom and dad who were in their mid-eighties. I
    would be leaving my neighborhood, and the morning bike rides with Mt. Timpanogos directly
    over my handlebars. I had never lived away from the Utah/Idaho landscape. </p>
<p>When it came time to board the plane, I didn't exactly dance down the LA concourse for
    the 13 hour flight to Sydney. I was scared. But as far as it is to the other side of the
    world, the journey I was about to begin was less a journey of miles than it was a journey
    of my heart. I didn't realize it then as I fastened my seat belt, but I was about to
    discover the depths of my heart reflected in the depths of the Australian landscape.</p>
<p>One of the beauties of the "Land Down Under" is in her extreme
    contrasts--heights and depths, mountains and plains, droughts and floods, beauty <em>and</em>
    terror. Describing these extremes, Dorothea McKellar poetically captures this landscape.
    Aussies of all ages can recite these words <em>by heart</em>:</p>
<p>"I love a sunburnt country, <br />
    A land of sweeping plains,<br />
    Of ragged mountain ranges,<br />
    Of droughts and flooding rains.<br />
    I love her far horizons,<br />
    I love her jewel-sea,<br />
    Her beauty <i>and</i> her terror--<br />
    The wide brown land for me!<br />
    . . .<br />
    Core of my heart, my country!<br />
    Her pitiless blue sky,<br />
    When sick at heart, around us,<br />
    We see the cattle die--<br />
    But then the grey clouds gather,<br />
    And we can bless again<br />
    The drumming of an army,<br />
    The steady, soaking rain. . . ."<br />
</p>
<p>Having just left places and people that I knew so well, arriving in <em>this</em> new
    landscape meant landing in many new extremes for me personally. It felt like I was in a
    drought of certainty and in a flood of questions. Like perhaps you are now, I was asking
    about my identity and purpose in this new place. How can I get along away from my family?
    What is my niche here? Will I find any friends? Do I have what it takes to contribute to
    life in this new land? Will I like how I grow or will it just hurt all the time?
    Essentially, I was asking, WHO AM I in this new life?</p>
<p>No matter the specific answers, I for sure knew that I wanted to learn more, to grow
    more, to love more. I <em>hoped</em> that I could, and I <em>believed</em> in my head that
    I could, but I didn't yet <em>know</em> in my heart that I could. I had only just begun
    what a Northern Cheyenne woman wisely described as "the longest journey that any of
    us will ever take "--the journey from my head to my heart What are the extremes of <em>your</em>
    new landscape? You have now left the comforts of your parents' home, and other comfort
    zones: your high school friends, your hometown. You have landed in Rexburg, of all places!
    Eastern Idaho! Where potatoes are mascots and the winds blow so hard chickens lay the same
    eggs twice! And then there are your roommates. Russets? Maybe. Maybe she is from Seattle
    and has rusted instead of tanned. Or maybe she's from San Diego and thinks life is a
    beach. Yes, your roommates and life in your apartment, if it hasn't already, will become
    one of your extremes.</p>
<p>So much for your roommates. What about you? How will you discover <em>you </em>in this
    new landscape? Discover what is <em>in</em> you? How will you move from <em>your</em> head
    to <em>your</em> heart? As you make this "longest journey," there are some
    extremes in <em>this</em> landscape that you should be aware of. There are some quicksand
    to be warned of, some predators to avoid, some bad weather to prepare for--<em>and</em>
    some beauties not to miss! In the safety of these moments here today, I would like, with
    candid words of warning and hopeful words of cheer, to offer--how you might grow instead
    of wither in the midst of your extremes. I want, most of all, to be encouraging.</p>
<p>I follow in the spirit of President Hinckley, two weeks ago, as he fervently counseled
    mothers to warn their children firmly and with love about drugs, tattooing, body piercing,
    sleazy concerts, and any other debilitating habits and addictions. His clarity leaves us
    no room for misunderstanding or rationalizing. To avoid the pitfalls of this world--of
    this landscape, if you will--you must look inward to the condition of your heart of which
    the external behaviors are only extensions. </p>
<p>We cannot truly grow if we bury our hearts and inherent worth under the rubbish of poor
    choices. The crux of my prevention message to you against dangerous extremes can be summed
    up in two words: <strong>Get real! </strong>In other words, avoid <em>seeming,</em> as you
    work to become authentic. Mere seeming thwarts our development. The world may entice you
    into the quick sand full of illusions. But remember, <em>you</em> will choose whether you
    fall for it.</p>
<p>Satan wants you to fall. He doesn't want you to be <em>real</em>. He knows that you are
    a child of God and he wants you to forget or disregard that. Esau, the son of Isaac and
    the brother of Jacob, fell for this temptation when he gave away his inheritance--his
    noble birthright--for a bowl of cereal. He was <em>not</em> true to himself. And neither
    are you when you give yourself away too cheaply. </p>
<p>"How do I succumb to the cheap extremes?" you may ask. One way, and there are
    many, is when--in your dating, for example--you are not as careful as you should be about
    when, how, and to whom, you show affection. The desire for that expression can be
    motivated by forces and strong drives other than true love. Erich Fromm said,</p>
<p align="left">"<i>Desire</i> can be stimulated by the anxiety of aloneness, by the
        wish to conquer or be conquered, by vanity, by the wish to hurt or even to destroy, as
        much as it can be stimulated by love. Sexual desire can easily blend with and be
        stimulated by any strong emotion, of which love is only one. Because sexual desire is in
        the minds of most people coupled with the idea of love, they are easily misled to conclude
        that they love each other when they want each other physically. . . . [But] if [this]
        desire . . . is not stimulated by real love, . . . it . . . leaves strangers as far apart
        as they were before -- sometimes it makes them ashamed of each other, or even makes them
        hate each other, because when the<i> illusion</i> has gone, they feel their estrangement
        even more markedly than before." (<i>The Art of Loving</i> (1956), pp. 45-6) 
				</p>
<p>In short, save your kisses for when you really mean them. In addition, even when--or
    especially when--<em>true</em> love <em>is</em> present, that is all the more reason to
    express your feelings with integrity. R<em>eal</em> love depends on your integrity being
    intact. To put it bluntly, do not let someone persuade you into a NCMO session this
    week--or ever-- even if they promise you true affection. It won't be! And do not get into
    any other habit that brings temporary relief, but ultimately only makes you feel worse.
    Remember that a kiss symbolizing love and respect is different from a kiss of
    self-centered sensualism. When you are given entrance to the heart of a trusting friend,
    know that you stand on holy ground. In such a place you must be honest with yourself and
    with your friend about the sincerity of your love and the expression of its symbols.</p>
<p>And then there is the temptation within the dangerous extremes to forget <strong>how
    much you are worth</strong>; to measure your worth and your love-ability by external
    signs. It's not unusual to wonder at times if other people love you or even if the Lord
    loves you. But if that doubt becomes a habit, you will lose touch with who you really are.
    Those times of doubt will pass much faster if you don't fall for the <em>seeming external</em>
    symbols like popularity, money, or fashion to determine your worth. Anybody can wear
    fashions that become costumes or act out a part, but only you can be you. If you measure
    your value by the number of dates you have in a week, you run the risk of feeling sorry
    for yourself. Too much of that and you eventually will be tempted to marry not for real
    love, but to show the world that <em>somebody</em> will have you Such a marriage is made
    of illusions. That <em>seeming</em> starts when you doubt your real worth.</p>
<p>A former student, I'll call Amy, found it hard to live up to her own worth. She wrote
    in one of her papers, "I really loved this guy and I saw no problem with our
    relationship. There <em>were</em> problems though . . . I rationalized by saying, 'I'm not
    going to marry him--It's OK. And besides, I'll be a good influence.</p>
<p>"I finally could not stand living a lie. I was not being true to myself. (And
    notice) <em>I was not acting like the person that I knew I was inside.</em>" (She
    wasn't lifting him up. He was pulling her down!) She wisely concluded, "I needed to
    make a change in my life." </p>
<p>And finally she did make a change. She had been letting the <em>illusion</em> of love
    overpower who she <em>really</em> was. When that muddied water cleared, she could see that
    "Remaining true to yourself and your beliefs is the best joy you can find."</p>
<p>One crucial truth, in the long run--and in the short--is that only the Lord's approval
    of you <em>really</em> matters. When your identity is secure, when the knowledge that you
    are God's and He is yours, burns in your bones stronger than anything else you know, only
    then are you free to discover the fullest measure of who you are. Feeling His love is
    worth more than any other reassurance. If your <em>belief</em> is not yet something you <em>know</em>
    for yourself--how happy you will be when you do <em>know</em>! Talk to Him. You are <em>everything</em>
    to Him--His work and His glory. He will let you know He is there when you are in
    unfamiliar territory and stretched to your greatest extremes. He will never let you down.</p>
<p>And then deep <strong>relationships</strong> will follow, especially as you date; they <strong>will
    evolve in their proper order </strong>and reflect the authenticity of both of you. </p>
<p>Lowell Bennion once described a good dating relationship as being like a pyramid. The
    base of the pyramid is friendship. The ascending layers are built of time, understanding,
    respect, and restraint. At the top of the pyramid, if it is worthy of a marriage, is a
    glittering little mystery called romance, "the spark." That spark will be
    squelched if you try to perch the pyramid on its point instead of its base. In short, if
    you want a relationship to stand the test of time and be stable even when the world is
    not, be friends first. </p>
<p>We, my husband and I, had known each other two or three months before romance dawned on
    us. We became friends because we had a BYU religion class together called, "Your
    Religious Problems." (In fact, we solved our most pressing religious problem by just
    meeting in that class!) After class each day, several of us would talk as we ambled down
    to the devotionals together. We discussed the gospel questions that had been brought up in
    class, sharing <em>real</em> thoughts of the mind <em>and</em> the heart.</p>
<p>I remember very well the night our friendship genuinely became something more--the
    night the top of our pyramid really sparked. We were dancing. Gradually, all else faded
    except the music, and the sense of moving together to the mellow tones of Nat King Cole. I
    just remember feeling a little zinging flare, like someone had struck a match. As I
    remember (and I do have to admit that our memories differ just a little on this point), <em>one</em>
    of us said, "It's worth waiting for, isn't it?" And the other dreamily replied,
    "What's worth waiting for?" To which the other replied, "You know what's
    worth waiting for."</p>
<p>Neither of us dated anyone else after that. We had discovered in our college landscape
    the natural growth of being in friendship first, and in romantic love second. That
    progression is worth seeking for and working for. The spark on our pyramid has never
    faltered. </p>
<p>A sure protection from the metaphorical bad weather in this world is deep, authentic
    relationships. Seek to develop them. A real friend can provide a softening refuge from the
    harshness of the inevitable extremes; they can help shoulder your burden when otherwise
    your knees may want to buckle.</p>
<p>The world would have you romp in the dark caverns and dangle over the jagged cliffs of
    doing <em>whatever</em> <em>you </em>want <em>whenever</em> <em>you</em> want. Against
    this temptation, may I show you a more en-joy-able way? Walk the higher road of <strong>self-restraint.</strong>
    Develop the power to deny yourself. Learn when to say no to your passions, in all their
    varieties, and when to say yes. A person with that kind of self-restraint will discover
    the truest kind of love. Alma explained this to his son Shiblon in a <em>seeming</em>
    contradiction: "Bridle your passions that ye may be filled with love" (Alma
    38:12). </p>
<p>Comparing verses from Sections 63 and 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants may help
    explain this paradox: (Note the stark contrast between the bitter fruit of lustful
    thoughts and the sweet fruit of virtuous thoughts.)</p>
<p>1. In Section 63: Those who look upon others with lustful hearts "shall not have
    the Spirit," In Section 121: Those who have virtuous thoughts "shall have the
    Holy Ghost as a constant companion." </p>
<p>2. Section 63: Those with lustful hearts "shall fear."&nbsp; Section 121,
    oppositely: Those with virtuous thoughts--find that their "confidence" shall
    "wax strong in the presence of the Lord."</p>
<p>3. Section 63: Those who lust "shall deny the faith." Section 121, in
    contrast, states: For those virtuous-thinking ones--"the doctrine of the priesthood
    shall distill upon [their] souls as the dews from heaven."</p>
<p>Note how strongly, and pointedly, the Lord warns--and promises. He uses
    "shall"--<em>no</em> doubt, nothing wishy-washy. When you think virtuously, the
    saving doctrines appear fortifying the truth already present in you real heart--a heart
    where there is no seeming, no pretending to be something you are not. </p>
<p>You may think that virtuous living means that you will miss out on a lot of fun. But
    did you know that the problem isn't that lustful, cheap thrills--like NCMOs--are <em>too</em>
    satisfying, it's that they are not, <em>cannot</em>, be satisfying enough? As Jacob taught
    in 2 Nephi 9, do not sell your soul for that which <em>"cannot"</em> satisfy.
    The fact is, sex--in any of its forms--outside its appropriate boundaries will bury you in
    illusions--tricks that make it <em>seem</em> desirable when actually that kind of sex
    smothers your growth. The more you indulge in it, the more you forget who you are. This is
    an extreme you can choose to avoid. In the vernacular of the day, "Dude, don't go
    there." </p>
<p>Aside from dating, let me mention two other ways that mere seeming may get you into
    trouble. First, this is a time of real confusion about the way a woman can <em>seem</em>
    to be successful. In this unstable landscape, some vices are telling you young women to
    just give up on the marriage and motherhood thing and liberate yourself by becoming a
    jet-setting career woman. This message scares some LDS young women so much they stay away
    from education altogether. Still other voices would tell young women they can have it;
    they can have it all; they can have it all right now--and this message can simply
    overwhelm you.</p>
<p>Let us look to the teachings of the prophets to get priorities straight. The prophets
    celebrate the womanhood that is at the heart of a family home. Marriage and family do come
    first, not only for women, but also for men. It frustrates me that the world's current
    devaluation of motherhood is telling women that preparing to be a homemaker, wife, and
    mother is 'no big deal.'When I <em>get real</em> about this subject, I know that there is
    no more meaningful career (or calling, than to truly <em>make</em> a home--filled with
    love, and stimulation for the mind and the spirit. Such a home--maker feels the joy that
    lie beyond a first glance at the <em>seeming</em> drudgery of a diaper, a frying pan, or a
    worn-out tennis shoe.</p>
<p>President Hinckley said, "Women who make a house a home make a far greater
    contribution to society than those who command large armies or stand at the head of
    impressive corporations" (Stand for Something, 152). </p>
<p>What, then about education and careers for women? The Prophets teach us that the issue
    is not marriage <em>or</em> education, the issue is <strong>marriage <em>and</em>
    education</strong>. It is exactly because family life is so important that a woman needs,
    in President Hinckley's words, "all the education [she] can get."</p>
<p>Having had a house full of my own children for over 35 years, complete with the
    wonderful and not-so-wonderful surprises, I can say without hedging even a little, that
    being a prepared wife and a mother <em>is</em> worth all that it costs. It's worth the
    stretch, the discouragement, the trauma, the tribulation--because <em>this</em> <em>is
    growth</em>--theirs and yours. The joy of that growth is priceless.</p>
<p>Here is another more subtle form of <em>seeming</em> that can lure you away from being
    "the genuine article," as they are fond of saying in Australia. In communities
    where religious roots are broad and deep, it is easy to hide what you really feel behind
    actions that <em>look</em> the way they are supposed to look. I've noticed, this can be a
    common problem among us, especially in places like Ricks and BYU. Your very presence here
    is based on your displaying external signs that you live your religion, which may or may
    not accurately reflect your heart. A large percentage of us have grown up in the church so
    we know how to <em>seem</em> faithful, how to wear the signs and do all the right things,
    but that can easily be based in cultural habit more than in <em>real</em> personal
    conviction. </p>
<p>Watch, in this next example, how one missionary moved because of his <strong>personal
    honesty</strong> from going through gospel motions to discovering the truest of the
    gospel's <em>emotions</em>. He writes: "When I began my mission, I was unsure of my
    testimony, but was caught up in trying to understand what missionaries <em>did</em>. . . .
    Yet I yearned to say 'I know', not 'I believe.' As time went on, I had experiences in
    which I saw for myself how the Spirit literally changed the lives of our investigators,
    members, and other missionaries. After several months, I found myself saying with complete
    integrity that the Lord had influenced <em>my</em> life. I discovered that for me a
    testimony is a gradual, growing thing rather than a sudden yes or no event. Through all of
    this, <em>I never changed my conviction about being honest with myself.</em> <em>Because
    of that honesty</em>, the spiritual experiences I did have meant more to me, because <em>I
    knew they were real</em>.</p>
<p>"I could trace my development through the verses in Alma 32, which became a source
    of great comfort and understanding for me. As Alma put it, 'For ye know that the word . .
    . hath sprouted up . . . that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your
    mind doth begin to expand. O then is not this <em>real</em>? I say unto you, Yea.'
    (32:34-5)</p>
<p>Real people come to know <em>why</em> they do what they do and their actions are
    consistent with what they feel in their hearts. And so, you ask candidly, what do you do
    if in your heart you would genuinely feel to hurt someone? Do you act on that feeling in
    the name of personal honesty? No. Of course not. But yes, you do exercise self-restraint
    and acknowledge to yourself the need to change your heart. Then you set about doing
    everything you can to have "no more disposition [to do] evil" (Mosiah 5:2) but
    to grow continually and experience the "mighty changes of heart" (Alma 5:12-14).
    </p>
<p>Notice what motivated such a mighty change in this story of a wayward young man. Having
    spent all he had, he would have been content to eat with the pigs. Then he <em>woke up.</em>
    His desperate situation compelled him to change his life. And here's the point. (Quote)
    "<em>When he came to himself--"</em>in other words, when he remembered who he <em>really</em>
    was--he desired to go home. "When he was yet a great way off," says the story,
    his father saw him coming, and "<em>ran</em>" to meet him. His father didn't
    walk; he ran! I testify to you that when you come to your real selves, <em>your</em>
    Father--your Heavenly Father--will <em>run</em> to you. As was the case with the prodigal
    son, your turning to Him will not eliminate all the consequences of poor choices. But <em>your</em>
    Father will be with you every step of the way as you deal with what has resulted from your
    choices; and you--if you desire--can, with His help, make your way Home. </p>
<p>Never will He be with you more than when you are in the extremes of <strong>choosing to
    change</strong> for the better. He will never forsake you.</p>
<p>All of these suggestions have been ways in which you can avoid causing yourself more
    pain than is necessary as you journey further into adult life. Remember too that the
    gospel is not given to us to <em>prevent</em> our pain, it is given to help us <em>heal</em>
    and grow from our pain. As Sheri Dew has said, "the gospel is not hard to live. Life
    is hard. And the gospel gives us the tools to help us live it." And I might add, life
    is supposed to be hard. We learn more that way in this earth school.</p>
<p><strong>So, <em>get real!</em> Remember your eternal worth, let relationships grow in
    their proper order, develop self-restraint, prepare yourself to make a home, be honest
    with yourself and others, and humbly change when necessary.</strong> These are all
    invaluable provisions against any extremes that you encounter in life's landscape. </p>
<p>It is the lay of this mortal land that your highest joy may come even in the very
    middle of your difficulties. That mix is the heart of <em>real</em> life. It comforts me
    in the extremes I am facing right now to read of Ammon and his brothers' experiences as
    they "journey[ed] in the land." They suffered, they sorrowed, they were
    afflicted; and yet they knew "incomprehensible joy" (see Alma 28:8). Indeed, as
    Lehi taught, if you do not experience some sorrow and affliction, you cannot experience
    real joy. (See 2 Nephi 2:22-25) And, as Robert Louis Stevenson said, "if you miss the
    joy, you miss it all." </p>
<p>Most Australians carry with them in these memorized lines this same message of joy
    arising from sorrow. Let's go back now to the fourth stanza of "My Country," and
    you will see what I mean:</p>
<p>"Core of my heart, my country! <br />
    Land of the Rainbow Gold,<br />
    For flood and fire and famine,<br />
<i>She pays us back threefold</i>;<br />
    Over the thirsty paddocks,<br />
    Watch, <i>after many days,</i><br />
    The filmy veil of greenness <br />
    That thickens as we gaze."<br />
</p>
<p>When Australians have endured, and struggled through, and grown from "many
    days" of "flood and fire and famine," the land "pays [them] back
    threefold." The green of new growth comes after--often because of--the adversity. <em>As</em>
    we struggle through our traumas and tragedies, the Lord will sustain us more if we trust
    him. He will send His dews and veil our thirsty pastures in thick green.</p>
<p>Let me share a story about how a young woman discovered what it is that allows us to
    know joy even as we are afflicted, and <em>who</em> it is that makes that joy possible.
    The students in my Book of Mormon class here at Ricks a few years ago were working on an
    assignment on the Savior's atonement. They were to study, then teach the doctrine to
    someone else, and then apply the atonement to their own lives. This had been a stretching,
    difficult assignment for Heidi. She was in the middle of typing her paper summarizing her
    findings and describing her own experience when she made her discovery--when her landscape
    began to thicken with green. She wrote, "I am sitting here typing my paper, but I am
    having a hard time seeing the words on the page because of the tears. It has just hit me
    as I have been typing, that the Savior made his atonement <em>for me,</em> that He loves
    me enough that He would do it for me alone."</p>
<p>Heidi found out how the Savior feels about her. That knowledge is where her joy comes
    from. That joy is the core of her testimony. Everything else is built on that. Led by his
    honesty, the missionary we talked about earlier discovered this same core. And, this joy
    and testimony is <em>my</em> core--the "core of <em>my</em> heart."</p>
<p>"Core of my heart, my country / Land of the Rainbow Gold," writes Dorothy
    McKellar of her homeland. But I discovered while in that land that she was also writing
    about me and you in the landscapes of our lives. In these last lines, the poem offers one
    more crowning image that is perhaps more meaningful than the author realizes. For me, she
    is sketching with words what I discovered while my heart was being dredged by the
    extremes:</p>
<p>Core of my heart, my country!<br />
    Land of the Rainbow Gold,<br />
    For flood and fire and famine,<br />
    She pays us back threefold;<br />
    . . . .<br />
    An opal-hearted country <br />
    A wilful, lavish land-- <br />
    All you who have not loved her <br />
    You will not understand--</p>
<p>Australia is famous for its opals. What is so exquisite about these stones is the way
    they reflect the light. But their beauty isn't evident until after they have been mined,
    dug up from the depths of the outback. When the deep red soil gives way to the light, all
    the colors of the rainbow dance from within what otherwise appears to be just a rock. The
    outback appears desolate. But in actuality, if you dig, if you stretch, if you struggle,
    if you break the earth open deep enough, the land will compensate you for your trouble by
    yielding precious gems of light; each stone being unique. But notice, these gems come from
    the depths where there seems only to be darkness. Because of this, they have become a
    symbol of my heart-journey.</p>
<p>When the Lord took me to Australia, I thought my heart would break because of the
    extremes in my experience. And, gratefully, it did break! It broke open when I started
    reaching to <em>feel</em> what my head knew was true. Before I left home, I knew the
    Church was true and understood the gospel well enough to live by it and teach it to
    others, but the pain of the separation from my family and friends made me want to feel the
    comfort of His love like I had never wanted it before. Even though I was with my best
    friend, my husband, I still needed to know and to feel that the Savior was with
    me--always, just like He promises. </p>
<p>Facing little that was familiar to me, I needed to know that He would guide me no
    matter where I went. I understood that such a blessing of the Spirit's constant
    companionship depends upon my faithful living. Now my living took on new purpose and
    meaning. I wanted to be better at "always remembering Him." My heart broke open
    with the desire to reflect His light the way I could see His light reflected in others. My
    actions became expressions of my longings to belong to Him, and to be like Him.</p>
<p>I have always very much liked the painting of the Savior in the wine-colored robe. For
    a long time that picture was how I thought of Him--as a picture. But then, in my thirst, I
    dug through the scriptures, I scraped away the false illusions as I prayed, and I
    stretched myself further to live what I was learning. Then, as the poem says, "after
    many days," He became real to me--He became a living, breathing being that I could <em>feel</em>.
    </p>
<p>It is not that I have seen Him with my eyes. But my feelings for him run deeper than
    ever before. I feel so tender for Him. And I <em>know</em> how He feels about me; that He
    wants to be with me, too. This testimony is real, as real as the <em>knowledge</em> that I
    <em>will</em> be with Him someday--at Home. <em>That</em> was the jewel that I dug for and
    now live for. It was waiting for me to unearth it, with the Savior's help, from the
    landscape of my heart. And now, because I am always in this process, as my heart's opals
    are soaking in the Light of the Son, God's Son, I rejoice in what I feel for Him. </p>
<p>When I turned to him, He ran to me. If you will turn to Him, He will run to you. In the
    metaphorical landscape that is you--the real you--you, too, are "an opal-hearted
    country," and "a wilful, lavish land." With all your will, please follow
    God's will for you. He will guide you through the extremes you encounter in your journeys
    in the land so you won't get buried in the darkness of illusions. I pray that "you
    will love [Him]," so "you <em>will</em> 
      understand." I pray with these words from my heart that you will 
      understand how much He loves you. May you bring your heart to Him and hold 
      it up to His light. As with the opals, you will be stunned by the beauties 
      of your unique colors. Know that you are His, and He is yours, 
    forever.</p>

<p align="left">It was exactly 20 years ago today that I spent my first whole day at the MTC and I was
scared to death.  Now I know what you're thinking, every missionary is scared on his first day,
but with me it was different.  You see, I had been baptized less than three years earlier and I felt I
knew very little about the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  I had read the Book of Mormon once, but I had
never read the Bible nor the Doctrine and Covenants.  I had never attended an early morning
"cemetery" class, and I had never participated in a family prayer or family home evening.  I had
been called to serve in Belgium and France, but I couldn't speak a word of French.  I felt like
Nephi must have felt when he was asked to get the plates of brass.  You remember the story.  He
knew the Lord would prepare a way for him to accomplish the task but he had no clue how.  He
wrote, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things I should do."<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a>  I felt the
same way entering the MTC, although I was pretty sure I wouldn't find anyone there drunken and
passed out.  For the next two years, in fact, for the next 20, the Lord has directed the paths of my
life in ways that I never would have expected.</p>
<p>	I have chosen to speak today on the topic of personal revelation--more precisely, how to
prepare to receive and recognize personal revelation.   I'd like to illustrate the importance of this
by beginning with a story.</p>
<p>	There once was a father who had four sons.  One day he sent his sons to their cabin to
ready it for the winter.  The cabin was located some distance away from their home, and was
without phone connection, but the father didn't worry, because he had given each son a cell
phone and knew that he could contact them in case of an emergency.  Not long after the sons'
arrival to the cabin, the father learned that because of heavy rains in the nearby mountains, the
cabin was in the path of a potential flash flood.  He called the first son to warn him to take his
brothers and evacuate the cabin.  The first son had not even turned on his cell phone and didn't
receive the message.  He then tried to call the second son.  His phone rang, but the music he was
listening to was so loud, it drowned out the phone and he didn't receive the message.  He then
tried to call the third son.  The third son actually heard his phone ring, but he was so busy
working on the cabin he didn't take time to answer it and didn't receive the message.  When the
fourth son's phone rang, he heard it and tried to answer it, but he wasn't used to working with a
cell phone and didn't know how to get an incoming call, so he did not receive the message.  The
father was grieved for he had done all that he could to warn his sons, but for various reasons they
would not receive his message.</p>
<p>	This brings to mind something that Brigham Young once said, "There is no doubt, if a
person lives according to the revelations given to God's people, he may have the Spirit of the
Lord to signify to him his will, and to guide and to direct him in the discharge of his duties, in his
temporal as well as his spiritual exercises.  I am satisfied, however, that in this respect,<em> we live
far beneath our privileges</em>"<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>	 As was mentioned in the introduction, I was recently released as a bishop of one of the
campus wards.  Before that I served as a counselor in another campus ward.  It seemed to me that
every semester, starting about midterm, some of the young men and young women of the ward
would start looking more friendly with each other.  They also seemed much happier.  I noticed
that not much later some of them would schedule an interview with me, and inevitably I would
hear the question, (you know, <em>the</em> question, the 'ring by spring or your money back' question)
"Bishop, how do I know if he/she is the right one?"  This afternoon, during this hour together, I
would like you to pretend with me that I am your bishop and you are the ward member who just
asked that most important, most vital, most <em>perplexing</em> question.</p>
<p>	Now before you married students and pre-missionaries tune me out, I want you to know
that this is more a talk about personal revelation than it is about getting married, so the principles
I will discuss can be applied to many important situations in your life as well. </p>
<p>	OK...so the first thing I would do as your Bishop is compliment you on your desire to do
the right thing in seeking the Lord's guidance in this matter. Then I would have you turn to the
bible dictionary, page 762, and read the following under the heading "revelation:"</p>
<p>Divine revelation is one of the grandest concepts and principles of the gospel of Jesus </p>
<p>Christ, for without it, man could not know of the things of God and could not be saved with any
degree of salvation in the eternities.  Continuous revelation from God to his saints, through the
Holy Ghost or by other means such as visions, dreams, or visitations, makes possible daily
guidance along true paths and leads the faithful soul to complete and eternal salvation in the
celestial kingdom.  The principle of gaining knowledge by revelation is the principle of salvation.</p>
<p>	Next, ya gotta understand that revelation is a spiritual gift from the Lord.   He will give it
when He's ready, and it will always be in accordance with certain divine principles or spiritual
laws.  Can I give you some ideas of what you can do to prepare yourselves to receive revelation? 
I've got seven for you:  </p>
<p>	IDEA #1:  <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Live clean, pure lives</span>.  Let me ask you a question:  How many of you would
take an advanced academic class without first having a knowledge of the fundamentals of that
subject?  Well it's just the same with personal revelation.  In order to receive specific divine
inspiration,  you must already live the Lord's basic commandments.  Elder Richard G. Scott tells
us that trying to receive personal revelation while not keeping the commandments is like pouring
contaminating fluid into a glass of pure water and expecting it to remain in only half of the glass,
leaving the other half pure.  The Spirit will not communicate continually where there is
impurity.<a href="#N_3_"><sup> (3)</sup></a> In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord declared, And if ye are purified and cleansed
from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.<a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)</sup></a>  There is
another reason why obedience is so important in receiving revelation.  President Harold B. Lee
taught a powerful principle that we're gonna get our answers from the source of the power we
choose to obey.  If we're following the ways of the devil, we'll get answers from the devil.  If
we're keeping the commandments of God, we'll get our answers from God.<a href="#N_5_"><sup> (5)</sup></a>  Living a clean and
pure life keeps the arteries of divine communication open.  Sincere repentance is like a spiritual
bypass operation that eliminates the cholesterol of sin from those arteries, thus clearing those
heavenly channels again.  </p>
<p>	IDEA #2 is to <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">search the scriptures</span>.  I love what Elder Bruce R. McConkie had to say
about this.  He thought that it is one of the best-kept secrets of the kingdom that prayerful study
and pondering of the holy scriptures will do as much, or more than any other single thing to bring
the spirit of revelation into our lives.<a href="#N_6_"><sup> (6)</sup></a>  The scriptures are your personal liahona, pointing the way
you should go in the wilderness of this world.  They were written by prophets, many of whom
were permitted to see our day.  Several of the choice revelations of the Doctrine and Covenants
were revealed as the prophets pondered the scriptures.<a href="#N_7_"><sup> (7)</sup></a>   Nephi counseled us to "feast upon the
words of Christ, for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."<a href="#N_8_"><sup> (8)</sup></a></p>
<p>	Combined with scripture study is my next idea, <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Ask in faith</span>.  There is probably no more
often repeated commandment in the scriptures than "Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall
be opened unto you."<a href="#N_9_"><sup> (9)</sup></a>  We may be worthy  to receive revelation, we may even be feasting upon
the scriptures, but if we don't ask, it is like having a driver's license and a new car, but no key. 
Prayer is the key to receiving revelation from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	So what does it mean if no answer comes?  Maybe you're not doing the right things. 
Maybe you haven't been doing the right things long enough.  This leads to my next suggestion,
<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Be patient</span>.  Spiritual communication is given in the Lord's time not man's.  Revelation is a
process, an experience sometimes given to us "line upon line, precept upon precept."<a href="#N_10_"><sup> (10)</sup></a>  Elder
Boyd K. Packer has taught that spiritual things can't be forced.  Don't be impatient to gain great
spiritual knowledge.  Let it grow, help it grow, but do not force it or you will open the way to be
misled.<a href="#N_11_"><sup> (11)</sup></a>  Forcing revelation is like baking bread and turning the oven up to 500 degrees so it will
cook faster.  The results will be disastrous.  </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	So what can you do while you are patiently waiting on the Lord?  Suggestion # 5 is<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"> Do
everything that is in your power</span>.  During my last year as bishop, we had almost 20 marriages in
the ward, and that was consistently the biggest piece of advice that I gave to my ward members.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">They reasoned that since they didn't have that sure confirmation beforehand, they were justified
in not making any action at all until they did.  Remember you shouldn't be asking the Lord to
guide your steps if you aren't willing to move your feet.  Heavenly Father has given you your
agency and common sense along with certain talents, gifts and abilities.  He expects you to use
them in your decision making process.  Then when you have chosen a course of action you can
approach Him in prayer for a confirmation.    Listen to how Elder McConkie chose his wife:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">How do you choose a wife?  I've heard a lot of young people from Brigham Young University
and elsewhere say, 'I've got to get a feeling of inspiration.  I've got to get some revelation.  I've
got to fast and pray and get the Lord to manifest to me whom I should marry.'  Well, maybe it
will be a little shock to you, but never in my life did I ever ask the Lord whom I ought to marry. 
It never occurred to me to ask him.  I went out and found the girl I wanted; she suited me; I
evaluated and weighed the proposition, and it just seemed a hundred percent to me as though this
ought to be.  Now, if I'd done things perfectly, I'd have done some counseling with the Lord,
which I didn't do; but all I did was pray to the Lord and ask for some guidance and direction in
connection with the decision I'd reached.  A more perfect thing to have done would have been to
counsel with him relative to the decision and get a spiritual confirmation that the conclusion,
which I by my agency and faculties had arrived at, was the right one.<a href="#N_12_"><sup> (12)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	On one occasion, shortly after his call as a General Authority, Elder Packer received some
counsel about a problem from President David O. McKay.  Elder Packer said he was very willing
to be obedient but saw no way possible to do as he was counseled.  He then went to Elder Harold
B. Lee and explained the situation.  Then Elder Lee said, 'The trouble with you is you want to
see the end from the beginning.'  Elder Packer replied that he would like to see at least a step or
two ahead.  Then, Elder Packer said, came the lesson of a lifetime.  Elder Lee told him, "You
must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a few steps into the darkness; then the light
will appear and show the way before you."<a href="#N_13_"><sup> (13)</sup></a>  Walk to the edge of the light and then a few steps
into the darkness.  There seems to be a delicate partnership here, to work as if everything
depends on you and to pray as if everything depends on the Lord. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	The saying goes that hindsight is 20/20 vision, but looking back now, every major
decision I have made in life (and that includes joining the Church, going to BYU, going to Ohio
State, choosing a career, even coming to Ricks) was made <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">without</span> a 100% sure knowledge that
those were the things I was supposed to do.  They felt right.  I considered the alternatives and
they didn't feel right.  I look back on them now and have no doubt that they were right.  But at
the time I went forward with my plans, having faith in the Lord, knowing that as long as I stayed
close to Him and sought His help, He would lead me by the hand, and give me answer to my
prayers.<a href="#N_14_"><sup> (14)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	IDEA #6 is, <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Be calm and at peace</span>.  The Lord told Joseph Smith, "Be still and know that I
am God."<a href="#N_15_"><sup> (15)</sup></a>  Elder Packer has addressed this theme many times in his general conference
addresses, for example:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Inspiration comes more easily in peaceful settings.  Such words as quiet, still, peaceable,
Comforter abound in the scriptures...(The trend in the world today) to more noise, more
excitement, more contention, less restraint, less dignity, less formality is not coincidental nor
innocent nor harmless.  The first order issued by a commander mounting a military invasion is
the jamming of the channels of communication of those he intends to conquer.  Irreverence suits
the purposes of the adversary by obstructing the delicate channels of revelation in both mind and
spirit.<a href="#N_16_"><sup> (16)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	A very good time for receiving personal revelation is in the early morning.  When Elder
Marion G. Romney, formerly a counselor in the First Presidency, was first called to be a General
Authority, he went to his good friend, Elder Harold B. Lee of the Council of the Twelve, for
some advice.  His counsel is valuable instruction to us all.  Elder Lee said, "My friend, I will give
you one piece of advice: Go to bed early and get up early.  If you do, your body and mind will
become rested and then in the quiet of those early morning hours, you will receive more flashes
of inspiration and insight than at any other time of the day."<a href="#N_17_"><sup> (17)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	It is also important to remember that we can only truly be at peace when we are in
harmony with our lives and with those around us.   President Lee said that if we're worried about
something or upset in our feelings, the inspiration won't come.  But if we live so that our minds
are free from worry and our conscience is clear and our feelings are right toward others, the
operation of the Spirit of the Lord upon our spirit is as real as when we pick up the telephone.<a href="#N_18_"><sup> (18)</sup></a> 
On one occasion while Joseph was still translating the Book of Mormon, he and Emma had a
disagreement.  Joseph couldn't continue the translation until he asked Emma's forgiveness and
made things right with her.<a href="#N_19_"><sup> (19)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	My final idea is this: <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Write down the promptings you receive and act quickly upon them.</span>
When you know that he/she is the right one, don't be afraid to act.  Remember that revelation
always comes as a conclusion, not necessarily as an explanation. Elder Scott remarked that when 
the Lord gives gentle promptings in answer to our prayers, sometimes they require us to think, to
exercise faith, to work, to struggle at times, and to act.  The whole answer to an important matter
or complex problem rarely comes all at once.  Usually, it comes a piece at a time, without the end
in sight.<a href="#N_20_"><sup> (20)</sup></a>  I firmly believe that the more you act upon the promptings you receive, the more your
ability to receive future promptings is increased.  Elder Scott believes that we often leave the
most precious personal direction of the Spirit unheard because we don't<em> record and respond</em> to
the first promptings that come to us when we pray.<a href="#N_21_"><sup> (21)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	So, again, those seven ways to prepare to receive revelation are: 1) Live clean, pure lives;
2) Search the scriptures; 3) Ask in faith; 4) Be patient; 5) Do everything that is in your power; 6)
Be calm and at peace; and 7) Write down the promptings you receive and act quickly upon them. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Now let's talk briefly about how personal revelation will usually come to you.  You need
to know that the way the Lord chooses to communicate to you is extremely personal.  Hopefully
you have already experienced the workings of the Spirit many times in your life.  Please know
that the Lord will not use a different manner to manifest His will to you now.  I have heard Elder
Packer say that as an apostle, he listens now to the same inspiration, coming from the same
source, in the same way that he listened to as a boy, only now the signal is much clearer.<a href="#N_22_"><sup> (22)</sup></a>  One
common mistake is to look for some kind of heaven-rending major manifestation of the spirit
accompanied by an angel or lightning and thunder.  President Spencer W. Kimball said that most
revelation comes to today's prophet in the less spectacular way--that of deep impressions,
without spectacle or glamour or dramatic events.  If we always expect the spectacular, we may
entirely miss the constant flow of revealed communication.<a href="#N_23_"><sup> (23)</sup></a>  Elder Neal A. Maxwell expressed
it this way,  God doesn't send thunder if a still, small, voice is enough or a prophet if a priest can
do the job.<a href="#N_24_"><sup> (24)</sup></a>  Don't ever think that just because someone else seems to have had a major spiritual
experience and you haven't, that you are somehow less worthy or less loved by our Father in
Heaven.  Be assured that He whose work and glory is your "immortality and eternal life"<a href="#N_25_"><sup> (25)</sup></a> will
not leave you without help or comfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	At the risk of great personal embarrassment, may I illustrate this important point with a
story from my own life?  When it was time to propose to Karen, I had everything all ready.  I
took her to a little, romantic French restaurant where we enjoyed a soft candlelight dinner.
(That's always the best way to eat snails.)  But I couldn't bring myself to propose because I was
doing exactly what President Kimball said I<em> shouldn't</em> do.  I was looking for some major
manifestation.  I felt I was entitled to it.  After all, wasn't this the most important decision I
would ever make in my life?  Now here's the embarrassing part: I excused myself to go to the
bathroom and while there I pleaded one last time for that visitation or lightning to come. 
Nothing.  After quite a few minutes,  (Karen insists it was longer than that) I returned to the table
and we left.  But as we were going to the car, I realized that I really had already received my
answer.  When I considered making her my wife, I felt at peace and it seemed right.  When I
pondered the prospect of breaking up or living my life without her, I experienced a cold, empty
feeling and I knew it wasn't right.  So I proposed to her in the parking lot, in the middle of
backing up my car.  What a romantic, eh?!</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Well, enough of that!  Now let's look at some examples of how the Spirit works in the
scriptures.  Please turn with me to the New Testament, Galatians chapter 5 verses 22 &amp; 23, page
1479.  Here Paul gives a quick checklist of the workings of the Spirit.  We read, "But the fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance
(which, according to the footnote, means self-control): against such there is no law."  </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Now please turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants, section 6, verse 15.  I don't think it
is a coincidence that several of the early revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith contain
descriptions of how the Spirit works.  In fact, one could say that he was being tutored in the
workings of the Spirit while he was receiving revelations on other matters.  In Section 6, verse 15
we read, "Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did <em>enlighten thy mind</em>; and
now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been <em>enlightened by the Spirit of
truth</em>."  Now look at verse 23: "Did I not speak <em>peace to your mind</em> concerning the matter?  What
greater witness can you have than from God?"  Now turn the page to Section 8, verses 2 and 3:
"Yea, behold, I will tell you <em>in your mind (thoughts) and in your heart (feelings)</em>, by the Holy
Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall <em>dwell in your heart</em>.  Now, behold, this is the
spirit of revelation..."  Now turn the page to Section 9, verse 8: "But, behold, I say unto you, that
you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will
cause that <em>your bosom shall burn within you</em>; therefore, you shall <em>feel</em> that it is right."  Now
please turn to Section 11, verses 12 and 13: "And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your
trust in that Spirit which <em>leadeth to do good</em>--yea, <em>to do justly</em>,<em> to walk humbly, to judge
righteously</em>; and this is my Spirit.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my
Spirit, which shall <em>enlighten your mind</em>, which shall <em>fill your soul with joy</em>."</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	You know that in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants, the
scriptures refer to the Spirit as the "still, small voice."<a href="#N_26_"><sup> (26)</sup></a>  Elder Packer stated that the Spirit does
not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand.  Rather it whispers.  It caresses
so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.<a href="#N_27_"><sup> (27)</sup></a>  Notice how he used the word <em>feel</em>
to describe the workings of the Spirit.  This is the same word Nephi used in chastising his older
brothers saying, "Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice
from time to time, and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past <em>feeling</em>,
that ye could not <em>feel</em> his words."<a href="#N_28_"><sup> (28)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Inspiration from the Lord can also come as flashes of ideas.  The Prophet Joseph told the
Quorum of the Twelve, "A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of
revelation; for instance, when you feel <em>pure intelligence flowing into you</em>, it may give you <em>sudden
strokes of ideas</em>, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon..."<a href="#N_29_"><sup> (29)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Now if you're not yet familiar with the way the Spirit communicates to you, don't worry. 
Joseph also told the Twelve that it is possible to "grow into the principle of revelation."<a href="#N_30_"><sup> (30)</sup></a>  This is
a gift that the Lord grants only after effort and repetition.  All of us need to constantly develop
this spiritual skill in our lives.  Even the Prophet Joseph was not exempt.  It is interesting to note
that Joseph used the Urim and Thummim to receive half of the first 16 revelations recorded in
the Doctrine and Covenants.<a href="#N_31_"><sup> (31)</sup></a>  Joseph told Orson Pratt that at first the Lord gave him the Urim
and Thummim when he was inexperienced in the spirit of inspiration.  But later when he had
advanced so far that he understood the operation of that spirit he didn't need the assistance of the
Urim and Thummim anymore.<a href="#N_32_"><sup> (32)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Perhaps at this point you may have a question: How can you tell whether what you're
feeling is true inspiration or indigestion or even "sinspiration" from Satan?  Please turn with me
to Doctrine and Covenants section 28.  This revelation was given at a time when Hiram Page,
who was one of the eight witnesses of the Book of Mormon, was pretending to receive
revelations for the Church with the help of a seer stone.  In Doctrine and Covenants section 28,
starting in verse 11, the Lord gave Joseph and the Church three ways to guard against false
revelation:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And again, thou shalt take they brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him
that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me and that Satan deceiveth
him; For behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall anything be
appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church covenants.  For all things must be done
in order, and by common consent in the church, by the prayer of faith (11-13).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Did you catch the three tests?  If all three tests are positive, then what you are feeling or
thinking is revelation.  The first is found in verse 11.  True revelation must be "of me."  We are
told in the scriptures that anything that is of God will edify, or in other words, uplift the recipient. 
This applies to your relationship too.  Are you better people when you're with each other?  Does
each of you inspire the other to do his or her best in studies, jobs, church callings, and other
significant responsibilities?  Or do you both live below your standards and ideals when you are
together?   President Gordon B. Hinckley asked, "How do we recognize the promptings of the
Spirit?  That which is of Christ does edify, and if we have that feeling of edification, then we
may know that the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, is speaking to us."<a href="#N_33_"><sup> (33)</sup></a>  For more details how to
judge between good and evil, read Moroni chapter 7.  For lack of time we won't turn there now.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	The second test is found in verse 12.  The Lord says that "these things have not been
appointed unto him."  Or, as the Prophet Joseph put it, "I will inform you that it is contrary to the
economy of God for any member of the Church, or any one, to receive instruction for those in
authority higher than themselves."<a href="#N_34_"><sup> (34)</sup></a>  Elder Dallin H. Oaks calls this the principle of "stewardship
in revelation."  About this principle Elder Oaks taught the students at BYU the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I have heard of cases where a young man told a young woman she should marry him because he
had received a revelation that she was to be his eternal companion.  If this is a true revelation, it
will be confirmed directly to the woman if she seeks to know.  In the meantime, she is under no
obligation to heed it.  She should seek her own guidance and make up her own mind.  The man
can receive revelation to guide his own actions but he cannot properly receive revelation to direct
hers.  She is outside his stewardship."<a href="#N_35_"><sup> (35)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">This is completely consistent with another divine principle, the law of witnesses, whereby "in the
mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."<a href="#N_36_"><sup> (36)</sup></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	The third test is also found in verse 12, namely, true revelation must not be "contrary to
the church covenants."  In other words, it will be consistent with the principles of the gospel as
revealed in the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets.  In 1945 the First Presidency
republished a message first given by the First Presidency in 1913, part of which contains this
statement, "Be not led by any spirit or influence that discredits established authority...or leads
away from the direct revelations of the Church.  The Holy Ghost does not contradict its own
revealings.  Truth is always harmonious with itself."<a href="#N_37_"><sup> (37)</sup></a>  For example, the Lord would not inspire a
young woman to marry a young man before he serves a mission or tell a couple to marry outside
the temple.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	Now, as your bishop, after all this, I want you to remember three things:  First, the Lord
loves you and wants you to be happy and succeed in your life.  Second, through personal
revelation He has given you a precious gift that you can use to include Him in every major
decision in your life.  Third, remember that revelation will come in the Lord's time after you
have prepared yourself to receive it.  And usually it will come as still and small whisperings of
the Spirit.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">	I testify that the principles we have discussed are true and that the Lord still continues
today to direct that scared elder of 20 years ago.  I am so thankful for the guidance the Lord has
given me throughout my life--especially in helping me choose Karen as my wife.  Personal
revelation is one of the greatest gifts from a benevolent Heavenly Father and one of the greatest
proofs that He lives and loves us.  It is my prayer that we will always live worthy of our
privileges with the Spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is a real pleasure to be with you on this brisk October afternoon.&nbsp; I have a great respect and
admiration for President Bednar and his colleagues and I always enjoy associating with them.&nbsp;
I
have looked forward to this opportunity to share some insights and my testimony of the Savior
with you. </p>
<p>I have looked back and tried to remember myself sitting in your situation.&nbsp; I also have
reconsidered lessons I have been learning since that time.&nbsp; Indeed, I have come to realize that if
we are not careful, school can teach us the wrong lessons.&nbsp; For example, I have spoken as a
professor and as a Church leader with many a student who was discouraged because the
competition in school was so keen.&nbsp; They had come from a high school where they were in the
top ten percent and were now in a freshman year where they were competing with all of the top
ten percenters or they had just started the masters program, coming from a college where they
had been in the top ten percent, and now they were competing with all of the top ten
percenters;
or they had just begun a Ph.D. program, and . . . well, you get the point.&nbsp; At each level we can
learn that we aren't as good as somebody else and if our perceived goodness depends on our
comparative advantage, we will always be found wanting.&nbsp; There is always somebody who is
better.</p>
<p>I have seen many students "drop out" as a result of such competition and what they concluded
about themselves.&nbsp; Some "dropped out" in the literal sense and others merely ceased giving their
best efforts because they no longer felt they could be the best.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most of us overestimate our own relative ability, as it turns out.&nbsp;For example,
a random sample of adult males was asked to rate their ability to get along with others.&nbsp;
Fully
sixty percent of them thought they were in the top ten percent.&nbsp; On athletic ability, where it
should be harder for American males to deceive themselves, sixty percent of them thought they
were in the top twenty-five percent.&nbsp;(<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Psychology Today</span>, 1980)</p>
<p>Consider my eldest son who, in politically correct language, is "vertically challenged."&nbsp;More
directly stated, for most of his life my son has been the smallest one in his class and has been
ever since he started attending school.&nbsp; Yet he fancies himself an NBA point guard, a la John
Stockton.&nbsp; He asked me the other day if I thought he could make it in the NBA (that is, in
professional basketball).&nbsp; My wife and I had worried about what our answer might be if it ever
came to a question like this.&nbsp; Well, I decided to be honest.&nbsp; I told him how hard it was to make it
into the NBA.&nbsp; I told him how few of the Jr. Jazz players actually got on a high school team, and
how few of the high school players actually made it to a college team, and how few of the college
players actually made it to the NBA and how few of the NBA players made it to the level of a
John Stockton.&nbsp; What I most wanted for him, I said, was that he would grow up to be a good
man, have a good family, and have a good enough job that he would be able to contribute to the
church and help build the kingdom.&nbsp; He seemed pensive, and I thought maybe I had made my
point.&nbsp; I worried that I might have discouraged him.&nbsp; A few days later I overheard our son talking
to his brother.&nbsp; They had just watched Steve Young playing football and he had decided to try
professional football instead of professional basketball.</p>
<p>So we tend to have inflated expectations and we can also over-react to negative comparisons with
others.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, my son often vacillated between feeling elated as he ran the Jr. Jazz
team, and being in the dumps because he wasn't good enough compared with his expectations.&nbsp;
Either way, our problem is that we too often use external comparisons to define ourselves.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't afford to ignore completely how we compare with others.&nbsp;Such insight can
help us make choices about a career or about when we ought to seek support from
others.&nbsp;However, I believe that if we don't put God and His desires for us first in our lives, we
will never amount to much in this life no matter how well we perform.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk to you about making something of yourselves, about developing the gifts
you have been given, and giving them in ways that bless others rather than in ways that merely
conform to the world's definition of value.&nbsp; I also want to consider with you, in contrast, what
occurs in our lives when we look beyond the mark and try to make something of ourselves that is
other than what we can or should make of ourselves.</p>
<p>As I was leaving for my mission, my father gave me a journal.&nbsp; On the first page of the journal he
had written the following from Jos<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">P</font><font face="Arial">&nbsp;s</font>de San Martin:&nbsp; "Ser<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">&lt;</font>s lo que hay que ser o no ser<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">&lt;</font>s nada."&nbsp;
A rough translation would be:&nbsp;"You will become what you must become, or you will be
nothing."&nbsp; I suppose one might interpret this statement as:&nbsp; "You will be what the world demands
of you, or you won't be anything."&nbsp;However, my intent is to consider how we may learn to find
and fulfill our particular mission from the Lord in building righteous families, his kingdom, and
our communities.&nbsp; If we fail to become what we must become to fulfill that unique mission, we
indeed will be nothing.</p>
<p>I haven't come to you with 3 easy steps to finding, developing, and giving your gifts.&nbsp;I think the
challenge is more complex than that.&nbsp; However, I have derived some insight from the scriptures,
from personal experience, and from two Broadway plays.&nbsp; Since each of us is unique, usually the
best we can do is listen for correct principles, observe the experiences of others, and let the Lord
help us apply the lessons we learn in appropriate ways to our own situation.</p>
<p>I have chosen to comment briefly on two plays:&nbsp; Arthur Miller's <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Death of a Salesman</span> and Peter
Shaffer's <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Amadeus</span>.&nbsp; In each of these plays, we see the main character near the end of his life.&nbsp;
We see people considering lessons from life from which we can learn much.</p>
<p>Let's begin with Willy Loman in <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Death of a Salesman</span>.&nbsp;
Willy Loman is obsessed with being well
liked.&nbsp; He had considered other possibilities besides sales for a career, but then he met Dave
Singleman who at eighty-four years of age was still a successful salesman.&nbsp; As Willy told it,
Dave could "go . . . into twenty or thirty different cities, and pick up a phone and be remembered
and loved and helped by so many different people . . . When he died . . . hundreds of salesmen
and buyers were at his funeral."&nbsp;(p. 81)</p>
<p>Well, after thirty-four years as a very mediocre salesman, Willy is fired from his job because he
can't perform, because he is a sham--somebody whose dreams and promises far outstrip his
abilities.&nbsp; He finally decides that his greatest worth is to commit suicide so that his wife and sons
will have the $20,000 from his life insurance policy.</p>
<p>At Willy's funeral the family and friends discuss his life.&nbsp; Biff, Willy's oldest son, who is
beginning to see the lie his father lived, says this about his father:&nbsp; "There were a lot of nice days
when he would come home from a trip; or on Sundays making the stoop; finishing the cellar;
putting on the new porch; when he built the extra bathroom and put up the garage.&nbsp;
You know
something, Charlie, there is more of him in that front stoop than in all the sales he ever made.&nbsp;
He
had the wrong dreams.&nbsp; All . . wrong.&nbsp; He never knew who he was."&nbsp;(p. 138)</p>
<p>It seems to me that Willy Loman could have contributed so much more to life and to his family if
he had only been able to accept who he needed to be and was able to be.&nbsp;Perhaps he should have
been someone who specialized in building things.&nbsp; Or, perhaps he should have tried to be the best
salesman he could be, but admit his limitations and pride himself in building the front stoop and
raising a good family.&nbsp; But, like many who walk through life following the world's standard of
value, he didn't ever know who he was or could have become.&nbsp; He was afraid of his greatest
gifts, perhaps because they seemed so small in the eyes of others and because he cared so much
about being well liked.&nbsp; As a result, in many ways he was nothing.</p>
<p>Next, consider Antonio Salieri, the main character in Peter Shaffer's play <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Amadeus</span>.&nbsp;
<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Amadeus</span>
was a Broadway hit for over three years and was made into a full-length motion picture that
perhaps some of you have seen.&nbsp; Salieri is the court composer who, because of his jealousy and
position of influence, insures that Amadeus, a man with a gift from God for music, is unable to
be recognized for his gifts during his life.&nbsp; Salieri is jealous because he desires to excel in a way
that only Amadeus was uniquely able to excel.</p>
<p>When he is 16, Salieri makes a bargain with god.&nbsp; "You give me fame as a musician and I will
serve you all my life."&nbsp;Salieri eventually becomes the court composer.&nbsp; And then, just as he is
maturing and achieving the fame that he sought, Amadeus, a brash, crude, and divinely inspired
brat, arrives at court.&nbsp; Salieri sees Amadeus' gift immediately.&nbsp; While others are repulsed by
Amadeus' crude and haughty personal style, Salieri realizes with bitterness and envy that God
has given to Amadeus the gift that Salieri had most wanted:&nbsp; the gift of pure, absolute, inspired
music.&nbsp; Amadeus was so gifted that he produced first drafts of long and complex operas with
hardly a correction. Salieri realized with horror that Amadeus "was simply transcribing music
completely finished in his head and finished as most music is never finished." (p. 71)</p>
<p>At the close of the play, Salieri is summing up his life following Amadeus' untimely death:&nbsp;"I
remained in Vienna, city of musicians, reverenced by all, and slowly I understood the nature of
God's punishment.&nbsp;What had I begged for in that church as a boy?&nbsp; Was it not fame?&nbsp;
Fame for
excellence?&nbsp; Well, now I had fame. I was to become, quite simply, the most famous musician in
Europe.&nbsp; I was to become bricked up in fame, embalmed in fame, buried in fame, but for work I
knew to be absolutely worthless.&nbsp; This was my sentence.&nbsp; I must endure 30 years of being called
'distinguished' by people incapable of distinguishing!"&nbsp; And finally - His masterstroke!&nbsp;
When
my nose had been rubbed in fame till vomiting, it would all be taken away from me, every
scrap."&nbsp; Salieri finally goes insane and tries to take his own life.</p>
<p>Shaffer's play, <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Amadeus</span>, fairly drips with irony of this sort.&nbsp;
Specifically, I want to note two
major and related ironies that might be instructive to us:</p>
<p>First, Salieri wants to serve as long as he can be famous.&nbsp; Ironically, he becomes famous but for
work that is not only relatively "worthless" when compared with Amadeus' but that does not
serve others.&nbsp;It is mediocre work and he knows it.</p>
<p>This irony is related to the paradox my family and I have noticed recently as we have been
reading the Sermon on the Mount together.&nbsp; The Savior first teaches that you should ". . . let your
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven." (Matt. 5:16)&nbsp; The Savior then teaches that when we serve we should not let the "left
hand know what [the] right hand doeth." (Matt. 6:3)&nbsp; What a paradox!&nbsp; How do we serve <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">secretly</span>
in ways that are <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">not hidden</span> from the world?</p>
<p>I believe that the Savior gives us the key later in the Sermon on the Mount when He focuses on
our <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">purposes</span> for serving.&nbsp; He teaches that we should "seek not the things of this world but seek
ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things
(he had been speaking about food and clothing) shall be added unto you." (JST Matt. 6:38)</p>
<p>In this context, I believe that the Lord is saying to us that we must be willing to be visible when
that will serve others and will lead them to glorify God rather than us, but that we must be careful
what our purposes are.&nbsp; This is difficult doctrine.&nbsp; The Lord is not giving us an easy set of rules.&nbsp;
Rather we are taught to seek a change of heart and then judge when to be secret and when to be
public.&nbsp; Otherwise, we have our reward in the praise and attention of others.&nbsp;
And, as Salieri
discovers, the praise of the world does not satisfy ultimately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can't really serve, then, if we are selfish.&nbsp; Our own selfish needs keep getting in the way.&nbsp;
We
are likely to give the wrong gifts like Salieri tried to do.&nbsp;Or we may give our gifts in a way that
blesses us more than the recipient.</p>
<p>A second irony is that Salieri is given a "complementary" gift, a gift that requires collaboration
with other gifts, and yet he seeks to excel as an individual.&nbsp;Salieri is born with a uniquely gifted
pair of ears.&nbsp; Not that he is a terrible composer--he just isn't great.&nbsp; But he has world-class ears.&nbsp;
He has the capacity to recognize what few, if any, in his age could recognize.&nbsp;Yet, when the
moment comes for him to exercise that gift, he instead seeks to make it impossible for Amadeus,
with God's gift, to excel.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul teaches about complementary gifts.&nbsp; He suggests that we each have different
gifts and opportunities that should be "fitly framed together in the body of Christ."&nbsp;
Each member
of this body is able to contribute to the whole, in large measure, because it is different.&nbsp;
Therefore, ". . . the eye cannot say unto the hand:&nbsp; I have no need of thee; nor again the head to
the feet:&nbsp;I have no need of you." (1Cor 12:21)</p>
<p>Gifts, then, are complementary in the sense that if we each do our part we can enhance and
expand the effectiveness of the other parts.&nbsp; Salieri's great sin is that he does not do his part
because he is so selfish.&nbsp; As a result, he is doomed to become, as he calls himself, "the patron
saint of mediocrities."&nbsp; He is not mediocre at all. He is just mediocre relative to his own prideful
pursuits.&nbsp; He is, more accurately, "nothing" because he doesn't use his gifts and opportunities to
bless others, to do what only he could do.</p>
<p>In the end, such seeking for self leads us to lose our best selves.&nbsp; The Savior teaches that we must
lose ourselves in His service if we would truly find ourselves.&nbsp; "Amadeus," the title of the play,
means "friend of God" or "lover of God."&nbsp;In the end, both Amadeus and Salieri fail because, in
spite of magnificent gifts from God, they do not love Him and they do not seek to serve anyone
but themselves.</p>
<p>The contrast between Willy Loman, a man with simple and quiet gifts, and Amadeus and
Salieri,
men of unique talent, is stark.&nbsp; And yet they suggest a common conclusion:&nbsp; When we look
beyond the mark and try to become something other than what is needed, other than what God
would have us become, we amount to nothing.</p>
<p>Have you noticed any of these paradoxes and patterns in your own life?&nbsp; I suspect you have
begun to notice from your patriarchal blessing, your comparative performances, the comments of
others, and the whisperings of the spirit, areas of both weakness and strength.&nbsp;
I suspect that you
have also noticed how selfish you can become with your gifts, your abilities, when school
pressures mount or when you are far from the spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>When I was in my first year of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, I can
remember running from one building of campus to another so that I would have less chance of
being stopped by someone in my stake where I served as stake mission president.&nbsp;
I was so
focused on surviving in a program for which I felt less prepared than many of my colleagues that
I didn't have time for anyone else.&nbsp; I soon saw the irony.&nbsp; I was preparing to become a manager
and hoping to use the insights and skills I gained to serve the Lord and my family but I didn't
have time to talk to someone who might need me as I walked between buildings.</p>
<p>So if selfishness is the great impediment to giving our gifts, how do we proceed?&nbsp;
I have
learned that the best antidote to selfishness is the atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
I have discovered
from my own personal experience that when I put my faith in the Savior, seek forgiveness, and
make and keep my covenants with Him, He changes my heart and fills me with peace and love
through the operation of the Holy Ghost in my life.</p>
<p>I remember quite clearly the night when a young woman came to me as her bishop and
confessed some rather sordid activities.&nbsp; I remember thinking as she began to talk that I knew
what kind of person she was.&nbsp; That is, I knew from the way she dressed and talked that she was
"dangerous."&nbsp; I knew that when I had been a student at BYU a few years earlier I would not have
associated with her.</p>
<p>I remember pleading with the Lord that He would help me to help this young woman, that
He would bless me to overcome my first, rather judgmental, impression enough to really
understand her.&nbsp; As she continued with her story, I felt something I can only describe as the pure
love of Christ come into my heart.&nbsp; I know that this feeling didn't come from my natural
self--I'm not that good.&nbsp;She felt that love and I witnessed miraculous healing and change in her
over the ensuing months.&nbsp; I know from personal experiences like this one that the Lord can fill us
with His love so that we can overcome our personal limitations and selfishness to help each
other.</p>
<p>This experience and a recent observation by Todd Britsch, a professor at BYU, give me a
sense of why the apostle Paul follows up his teaching about the body of Christ and our unique
gifts by extolling in the very next chapter of 1 Corinthians the virtues of charity, the pure love of
Christ (see Moroni 8:47).&nbsp;When we possess that gift of Christ-like love, we are able to allow and
encourage one another's gifts to flourish.&nbsp;We suffer long and are kind.&nbsp; We envy not, and are not
puffed up, nor do we seek our own interests.&nbsp; We are not easily provoked, nor do we think evil
(see 1 Corinthians 13:4-5).</p>
<p>Now, in closing, I want to share with you a personal experience I had with my
grandfather, Harold B. Lee, an Idaho boy like some of you and a past president of the Church,
wherein he taught me about developing and giving our gifts.&nbsp; When I was a senior in college, I
took my patriarchal blessing to Grandfather.&nbsp; My request to him was that he read my blessing
with me, and counsel me as to how I might recognize, develop, and give my gifts, using the
patriarch's inspiration as context.</p>
<p>Grandfather read my blessing and then said:&nbsp; "Well, Alan, that's a fine blessing."&nbsp;
He
paused, and continued:&nbsp; "My impression is that you worry too much about the future, Alan."&nbsp;This
was not what I had come to hear.&nbsp;Though I would not have admitted it at the time, in my heart of
hearts I hoped he would look into the crystal ball and tell me about a career.&nbsp;
In fact, I would
have been even more delighted if he had told me my future wife's name, and how to find her.</p>
<p>Grandfather went on to recount briefly, his own personal history.&nbsp; He said, "You know as
a boy growing up in Clifton, Idaho, we prayed for the 'pillars of the Church.'&nbsp;
We meant the
Brethren, the General Authorities.&nbsp; I could no more have thought of becoming one of them than
fly to the moon, which in those days also seemed an impossibility."&nbsp; He came home from a
mission and thought he would be a farmer, but things weren't going well there so he decided to
attend a university.</p>
<p>At the University of Utah he met a young woman who was willing to walk home with
him the five miles after a date, because he didn't have the five cents to pay the trolley.&nbsp;
Friendship ripened into love, and they were married.&nbsp; Upon graduation, Grandfather found a job
as a high school principal.&nbsp;After a few years, his wife suggested maybe he could be doing
something else and he got into distributing books throughout the Western United States.&nbsp;
Then,
one of the city commissioners died in the middle of his term, and Grandfather, because of
contacts he had made as a book distributor, was asked to fill the rest of that man's term.&nbsp;
He was
then elected to a term of his own.</p>
<p>During this same time, Grandfather had been called as a Stake President.&nbsp; Then the 1930
depression hit.&nbsp; He and other leaders in his stake dusted off the revelations, and tried to find a
way to help the almost 70% of their stake members who were out of work.&nbsp; They established a
Bishop's Storehouse and found ways to have those who were out of work harvest wheat that was
going unharvested because the price for wheat was so low it didn't pay to harvest it.</p>
<p>Then the Brethren called him to set up a welfare program for the entire church.&nbsp;Several
years later he was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, and at the time we were
talking he was in the First Presidency.</p>
<p>His question to me was:&nbsp; "Alan, do you think I could have taken thought, and prepared
myself to be where I am now?&nbsp; The only counsel that I have ever felt comfortable giving to young
people is that they get up each day and regain their testimony.&nbsp; And then in the light of the
inspiration of the Lord, 'in the moment thereof,' that they do what the Lord asks of them.&nbsp;
Don't
live too far into the future," was his counsel.&nbsp; "Live for today.&nbsp; You don't have tomorrow; all you
have is today.&nbsp; You don't have yesterday.&nbsp; All you can do is repent or feel good, depending on
your yesterdays.&nbsp; So make your yesterdays days to feel good about by living fully for today."</p>
<p>I've struggled to understand that counsel.&nbsp; I have come to understand that the strait and
narrow path is indeed a twisty passage, a maze through which we must pass.&nbsp; A strait
(s-t-r-a-i-t)
path is a narrow path.&nbsp; If we are to stay on that path, we must be open to inspiration from the
Lord.&nbsp; In order to do that, we must give up our own selfishness.&nbsp; We must invite the Lord's spirit
to be part of our lives by regaining our testimony each day.&nbsp; We must stay attuned or, as Elder
Maxwell says, we may climb the ladder of success and find it leaning against the wrong wall.&nbsp;
We should not wait until we have "arrived" to give our gifts.&nbsp; As we go through the maze of life
we must learn to give our widow's mite, to give what we have at the moment.&nbsp; If we stay on the
narrow path, the Lord will prepare us for what He needs from us.</p>
<p>The Lord will inspire us, if we remain true to His guidance, about which gifts to develop
and how to give them.&nbsp; He may also guide us to avoid some gifts.&nbsp; For example, at the funeral of
Elder Bruce R. McConkie, Elder Boyd K. Packer told of a time when Elder McConkie was in
tears because of the criticism some had made of him.&nbsp; Some felt that he was too doctrinaire, too
stern.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Elder McConkie said that when he would attempt to humanize and
personalize his talks his mind would be darkened and he would feel the Lord's spirit withdraw.&nbsp;
Elder McConkie had a gift for understanding and expounding the scriptures.&nbsp; He played a
significant role in bringing forth the new edition of the scriptures in 1981.&nbsp; He learned that our
gifts must be developed and offered under the direction of the Lord lest we lose them.</p>
<p>It may be that the Lord will one day call you to perform some very visible task.&nbsp;Perhaps
you might respond as did Moses, "but I am slow of speech," or Enoch, "I am but a lad."&nbsp;
Indeed,
that was the feeling that my Grandfather expressed.&nbsp;But then, if you have relied upon the Lord,
you can call upon him to magnify your gifts, and to help you be equal to the task.&nbsp;
He expects you
to give only what you have, and He will make up for the difference.</p>
<p>It may also be that you will say, as did my Grandfather, even if you were to have such a
position, that the greatest success that he had ever had as a leader in the Church was as an Ensign
Leader (the equivalent of our Priest's Quorum Advisor today), when he worked with a group of
young men who were inactive, but who liked to play basketball.&nbsp; He played basketball with them,
and loved them, and eventually each one of them went on a mission and became a faithful
contributor in the Church and Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you would be led to say as did President Lee, that "the greatest work you will
ever do will be within the walls of your own home."</p>
<p>May you become what you must become.&nbsp; May you develop your God-given gifts.&nbsp;
May
you work hard and persist even when it seems your gifts are only a widow's mite.&nbsp;May you seek
the inspiration of God, to know when to take the twists and turns that he would have you take, as
you confront life's challenges.&nbsp; May you be willing to work in obscurity, or in the public eye, as
"seemeth Him good."&nbsp;May you be great fathers and mothers and give your gifts to the Kingdom
of God, that you will indeed make something of yourself, or, better said, let God make something
of you, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="left">	I am humbled to be here on the beautiful campus of Ricks College once again with my wife, and to also be in the presence of President and Sister Bednar,
administrators, faculty, and members of the student body.  I express my thanks to
Sister Marybeth Jones and this wonderful Women's Choir which sang so beautifully for
us this afternoon.</p>
<p align="left">	I have chosen to speak today on the subject of prophets, specifically our living
prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley.  When the Apostle Paul was imprisoned prior to
his martyrdom as a follower of Christ, he wrote to his friend Timothy.  I would like to
share with you one sentence from that letter, from 2 Timothy 3:1.</p>
<p align="left"> <em>"</em> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."</p>
<p align="left"> 	Our only safety for perilous times was described by President Harold B. Lee:</p>
<p align="left">"We have some tight places to go before the Lord is through with this church and
the world in this dispensation, which is the last dispensation, which shall usher in
the coming of the Lord.  The power of Satan will increase; we see it in evidence
on every hand.  There will be inroads within the Church.  There will be, as
President Tanner has said, 'hypocrites, those professing, but secretly are full of
dead men's bones.'  We will see those who profess membership but secretly are
plotting and trying to lead people not to follow the leadership that the Lord has
set up to preside in this church. . . .</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><i>"We must learn to give heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall
give through his prophet, 'as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before
me; . . . as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.' (D&amp;C 21:4-5) 
There will be some things that take patience and faith.  You may not like what
comes from the authority of the Church.  It may contradict your political views.  It
may contradict your social views.  It may interfere with some of your social life. 
But if you listen to these things, as if from the mouth of the Lord himself, with
patience and faith, the promise is that 'the gates of hell shall not prevail against
you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before
you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory."</i><a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a>
</p>
<p align="left">	Much has been written about the meaning of the title--"prophet<strong>, </strong>seer, and 
        revelator." I would like to share with you Elder John A. Widtsoe's 
        definition: </p>
<p align="left">"A prophet is a teacher.  He teaches the body of truth, the gospel, revealed by
the Lord to man; and under inspiration explains it to the understanding of the
people. . . . (See D&amp;C 20:26; 34:10; 43:16).</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"A seer is one who sees with spiritual eyes.  He perceives the meaning of that
which seems obscure to others; therefore he is an interpreter and clarifier of
eternal truth.  He foresees the future from the past and the present. . . .</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"A revelator<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a> makes known, with the Lord's help, something before unknown.  It
may be new or forgotten truth . . .</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"In summary:  A prophet is a teacher of known truth; a seer is a perceiver of
hidden truth; a revelator is a bearer of new truth.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"One who bears the title of prophet, and they who sustain him as such, believe
that the children of men are capable of receiving and obeying truth.  Were it not
so, the title 'prophet, seer, and revelator' would be empty, hollow words.  As it is,
they are clarion calls of the Church of Christ to a world walking in the dim
shadows of misunderstanding."</i><a href="#N_3_"><sup> (3)</sup></a> </p>
<p align="left">	We see so many today walking in the dim shadows 
        of misunderstanding, as shown and told in this story as told by 
        President Harold B. Lee:</p>
<p align="left">"I have a banker friend back in New York.  Years ago when I met him in
company with President Jacobson, who was then presiding over the Eastern
States Mission, we had had quite a discussion.  President Jacobson had given
him a copy of the Book of Mormon which he had read, and he spoke very
glowingly of what he called its tremendous philosophies.  Near the close of the
business hour he invited us to ride up to the mission home in his limousine,
which we accepted.  On the way, as he talked about the Book of Mormon and his
reverence for its teachings, I said, 'Why don't you do something about it?  If you
accept the Book of Mormon, what is holding you back?  Why don't you join the
Church?  Why don't you accept Joseph Smith, then, as a prophet?'  And he said,
very thoughtfully and carefully, 'Well, I suppose the whole reason is because
Joseph Smith is too close to me.'  If he had lived two thousand years ago, I
suppose I would believe.  But because he is so close, I guess that is the reason I
can't accept.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"Here was a man saying, 'I believe in the dead prophets that lived a thousand
plus years ago, but I have great difficulty believing in a living prophet.'  That
attitude is also taken toward God.  To say that the heavens are sealed and there
is no revelation today is saying we do not believe in a living Christ today, or a
living God today--we believe in one long-since dead and gone.  So this term
'living prophet' has real significance."</i><a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)</sup></a> </p>
<p align="left">	I now turn my thoughts and remarks to our living prophet, President Gordon B.
Hinckley.  It is he alone who has the right to receive revelation for the Church and to
give authoritative interpretation of scripture that shall be binding on the Church.  He is
our Father in Heaven's sole mouthpiece on the earth and he, alone, may declare the
mind and will of God to us, His people.</p>
<p align="left">	Quoting from Abraham 3:23, "And God saw these 
        souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he 
        said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were 
        spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, 
        thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast 
born."</p>
<p align="left">	I believe President Gordon B. Hinckley was one of those present at that time
also and was chosen before he was born to be our prophet, seer, and revelator in this
day and age in which you and I live.  I assume most who are in attendance here today
had the opportunity of listening to President Hinckley's wonderful talk Sunday evening
in the Satellite broadcast to the youth, and which was rebroadcast again last evening
here in Rexburg on television.  As such, last night and this morning I have changed
much of what I was originally going to share with you.  In its place I would like to share
with you an experience or two which Sister Banks and I have had with the prophet.</p>
<p align="left">	Still,<strong> </strong>because of the profound impact he has upon our lives, I would 
        first like to review some of the concerns, counsel, and information he 
        has given to us over the last two years.</p>
<p align="left">From an address President Hinckley gave at a BYU Devotional, which I believe
is as applicable to the student body and faculty here at Ricks College, I quote as
follows:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"You can grow here as you have never before grown in all of your lives.  I want to
urge you to stand a little taller, to rise a little higher, to be a little better.</i>
</p>
<p align="left"><i>"The distance between mediocrity and excellence can be ever so small.  As we
shall see again when the Winter Olympics come to Salt Lake in 2002, that
difference will be measured in tenths of seconds.  The little extra effort we make
becomes such a tremendous difference.</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"I speak to you . . . not only about a little more effort, a little more self-discipline,
a little more consecrated effort in the direction of excellence in your studies.  I
speak of it also in terms of your lives.</i></p>
<p align="left">	"<i>This is the great day of preparation for each of you.  It is the time of beginning
for something that will go on for as long as you live.  You may not be a genius. 
You may be lacking in some skills.  But you can do better than you are now
doing. . . .  You are people with a present and with a future. . . .</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"You will find your greatest example in the Son of God.  I hope that each of you
will make Him your friend while you are here and ever after.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Jesus said, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect.'  (Matt. 5:48.)</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"This is the great crowning example of excellence.  May yours be a rich and
wonderful life moving in that direction.  We will not become perfect in a day or a
month or a year.  We will not accomplish it in a lifetime, but we can begin now,</i>
<i><font size="3">starting with our more obvious weaknesses and gradually converting them to
strengths as we go forward with our lives."</font></i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> <a href="#N_5_"><sup> (5)</sup></a></span></p>
<p align="left">	Members of the Church are sometimes asked why we do some of the things we
do as it pertains to our institutions of learning, such as Ricks College.  President
Hinckley has given the following answer to that question:</p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"The Church is an ecclesiastical organization.  It is concerned primarily with
worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Our great mission is to testify of His living
reality.  We should not be involved with anything not in harmony with this major
objective.</i>
</p>
<p align="left"><i>"We do many things which on the surface do not appear to be associated with
this overriding pattern. . . .  People ask why we sponsor such large and costly
institutions that are basically concerned with secular education.  The question is
appropriate.  This sponsorship has a doctrinal root.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"The Lord has decreed in revelation: 'Teach ye diligently and</i> <i> my grace shall
attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in
doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of
God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things
which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to
pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and
the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land;
and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.'  (D&amp;C 88:78-80.)</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"It is apparent that we are obligated not only to learn of ecclesiastical matters but
also of secular matters."</i><a href="#N_6_"><sup> (6)</sup></a></p>
<p align="left">	President Hinckley has always been very open with the press.  You may
remember his appearances on <em>60 Minutes </em>and <em>Larry King Live</em>.  Likewise, he has
addressed the National Press Club (March 2000), The Los Angeles World Affairs
Council (May 1999), and the U. S. Conference of Mayors (September 1998) regarding
the Church and its operations.  Here are a few quotes from his talks to those
organizations:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"We are now operating in more than 160 nations.  Our worldwide membership is
approaching 11 million.</i>
</p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"Of these, approximately four million are women who belong to what we call the
Relief Society of the Church.  People wonder what we do for our women.  I will
tell you what we do.  We get out of their way and look with wonder at what they
are accomplishing.</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"We face a new challenge today.  In the underdeveloped countries we have
young men and women, many of them of capacity, but without opportunity to
improve themselves.  They cannot do so without help.</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"We are already engaged in micro-credit undertakings, whereby small amounts
are loaned to those for whom a hundred or two or three hundred dollars can
spell an actual change in their future.  When given such credit these people
become entrepreneurs, taking pride in what they are doing and lifting themselves
out of the bondage that has shackled their forebears for generations.  From a
bread shop in Ghana to a woodworking business in Honduras, we are making it
possible for people to learn skills they never dreamed of acquiring and to raise
their standard of living to a level of which they previously had little hope.</i></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>	"Politics has not been a consideration in assisting those who are the recipients of
this help.  In North Korea we have supplied seed, fertilizer, and expertise to help
the people help themselves in combating the terrible hunger that is found there.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"Last year alone we sent humanitarian aid, giving 11.2 million dollars in cash and
44 million in material resources for a total $55.2 million."<a href="#N_7_"><sup> (7)</sup></a> </i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"You ask how all of this has been accomplished.  It takes money, you say. 
Where does it come from?</i></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="3">	"It comes from observance of the ancient law of the tithe. . . .  We do not pass
the plate.  We do not play bingo.  We pay our tithing and can testify to the
goodness of the Lord.</font></i></p>
<p align="left">	I think you will particularly enjoy this last 
        statement from President Hinckley:</p>
<p align="left"><i>"This law is set forth in 35 words in our scripture.  Compare that with the rules
and regulations of the IRS.<a href="#N_8_"><sup> (8)</sup></a></i></p>
<p align="left">	Personally, I am very grateful for the goodness 
        of the Lord in making available the wonderful welfare and humanitarian 
        aid to so many in need. I reflect on an experience I had while serving 
        in the Philippines a few years ago. A devastating typhoon had gone 
        through the country and left many of our members homeless, wet, and 
        without food. I remember how we loaded canoes with food, blankets, 
        clothing and medicine and paddled several miles through flooded streets 
        to bring aid to those who were taking refuse in one of our chapels 
        located on high ground. </p>
<p align="left">	On another occasion we visited a mountainous area 
        where floods had washed away the homes of a village to the point where 
        no one could get to the village for several days because of the 
        landslides. I will never forget the tears of gratitude of the people 
        from that village when the Church was able to bring humanitarian aid to 
        once again build houses for them to live in even though they were not 
        members of the Church.</p>
<p align="left"> <font size="3">	I have contemplated our recent presidential election and I understand you have
just concluded celebrating this year's "American Week."  I thought it would be well to
share some very touching remarks President Hinckley gave to students at Weber State
University on his feelings about America:</font></p>
<p align="left">"There are likely some here who are not citizens of this commonwealth.  I think I
have been to the places from which you come, and I have found much of
goodness and beauty there.  Beauty is to be found all over this earth.  But today
I wish to speak of America.</p>
<p align="left">"Do we have problems?  Of course we do.  There is trouble in the land.  There
are problems we do not seem capable of handling.  But I come here with a plea
this evening that you do not lose faith in America.</p>
<p align="left">"Why are people from across the world willing to risk their lives to come to this
land?  I dare to say that this nation, when all is said and done, is the greatest
stabilizing force in the world.  It leads in military power.  It leads in economic
strength.  It is not a perfect nation, but it is a great nation.</p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="3">	"My wife and I visited Israel the first time before the 1967 war.  Jerusalem was a
divided city.  A fence ran through it.  We hired a guide.  He was an Arab, a man
of learning, bright and intelligent and able.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="3">	"We climbed a little knoll, a high place in the city, and he pointed out his home,
on the other side of the fence, which had been taken from him.  He said
something I have never forgotten:  'You belong to the greatest nation on the face
of the earth.  Yours is the only nation which has been victorious in war and never
claimed any territory as a prize of conquest.  Your people have given millions,
even billions to the poor of the earth and never asked for anything in return. 
Rather, even after coming off as conqueror, you have poured in other billions to
revive those who had been your enemies in bloody conflict.'</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="3">	"I invite you students of history to go back in your minds to the Continental
Congress assembled in Philadelphia in the hot June of 1776.  There was drafted
the Declaration of Independence, which concluded, 'And for the support of this
declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we
mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.' 
Those who signed that document gave their lives, some literally, rotting away as
prisoners of war.  They gave their fortunes.  But they kept their sacred honor.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="3">	"It is the keystone of our nation.  It is the guarantee of our liberty.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>	"I wish only to say in conclusion to you young men and women who leave this
great institution to take your place in society, do not lose faith in the goodness,
the strength, and the generosity of this nation of which you are a part.  We have
our troubles.  We have our problems.  We have our crises, but we shall survive
them as we have done in the past."</i></font><a href="#N_9_"><sup> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">	(9)</span></sup></a></p>
<p align="left">In his epic address in our most recent general 
        priesthood conference, he again counseled on the importance of education 
        and other matters:</p>
<p align="left">	President Hinckley quoted from an article he read not long ago,
    <blockquote><blockquote>
<p align="left"> <i> ". . .The latest
Census information . . . indicated the annual wage for someone without a degree
and no high school diploma stood at little more than $16,000 nationally [in 1997]. 
The jump wasn't much higher for a high school diploma--$22,895 annual
average income.  As the level of education increases, however, so does the
span.  The holder of a bachelor's degree earned, on average, $40,478 that year. 
Finally, the holder of an advanced degree typically bumped up their annual
earnings by more than $20,000 to a nationwide average of $63,229, according to
[these] Census figures."<a href="#N_10_"><sup> (10)</sup></a></i>
</p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"Teach them the virtue of honesty.  There is no substitute under the heavens for
the man or woman, the boy or girl who is honest.  He or she can walk with head
high, standing above the crowd of lesser folk who constantly indulge in lying,
cheating, and who excuse themselves with statements that a little lying hurts no
one.  It does hurt, because small lying leads to large lying, and the prisons of the
nation are the best proof of that fact.</i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>	"Teach them to look forward to the time when they may be married in the House
of the Lord as those who come to the altar free from taint or evil of any kind."<a href="#N_11_"><sup> (11)</sup></a></i></p>

<p align="left">	Sister Banks and I recently had the opportunity to visit the new Boston
Massachusetts Temple, which is the 100th operating temple of the Church.  As we see
the many new temples being built across the earth, how grateful we are for the vision of
President Hinckley.  Fifty-three of the new temples in operation have been dedicated
since he became President of the Church just<strong> </strong>five years ago. He further tells us 
        (October 1999 general conference) what is necessary to qualify an area 
        for a new temple to be considered: </p>
<p align="left">"We do not build a temple until there are sufficient people in the area, until there
are sufficient tithe payers, and until there is sufficient faith; the very construction
of these sacred buildings becomes an indicator of the increase of faith and
obedience to the principles of the gospel."<a href="#N_12_"><sup> (12)</sup></a>

</p>
<p></p>
<p align="left">	In summation, President Hinckley uses many 
        recurring themes:</p>
<p align="left">Tithing - "The Lord carries great expectations of you in taking care of your part of
the burden of moving forward the work of the Lord, in the payment of your tithes and
offerings.  Tithing isn't so much a matter of money as it is a matter of faith.  The Lord
can't bless those who aren't obedient."<a href="#N_13_"><sup> (13)</sup></a>
</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Work - "Nothing happens in this Church unless you work.  It is like a
wheelbarrow.  It doesn't move until you get ahold of the two handles and push.  Hard
work moves the work of the Lord forward, and if you have learned to work with real
integrity it will bless your lives forever."<a href="#N_14_"><sup> (14)</sup></a></p>
<p align="left">Be Good to Your Parents - "All of their hopes and dreams rest in you.  They pray
for you.  They worry about you.  They think of you.  They love you.  Treat them with love
and respect and kindness.  It won't hurt you once in a while to tell them that you love
them."<a href="#N_15_"><sup>  (15)</sup></a></p>
<p align="left">A Peculiar People - "We are a peculiar people.  There is a wholesomeness about
you that is beautiful and wonderful.  We don't smoke, we don't drink, we don't even take
tea or coffee.  We do vicarious work for the dead.  We teach that marriage in the House
of the Lord is for time and for all eternity, that families can actually be forever.  We are a
peculiar people, and thank heavens we are.  If the world continues to go in the direction
it is going, families breaking up, pornography everywhere, drugs and things of that kind,
we will become an even more peculiar people.  God has blessed us generously and
kindly and greatly.  How thankful we ought to be."<a href="#N_16_"><sup> (16)</sup></a></p>
<p align="left">Many years ago President Marion G. Romney counseled us as follows, "Now . .&nbsp;.
if we will keep these things in mind, we shall not be deceived by false teachings.  I
remember years ago when I was a bishop and had President [Heber J.] Grant talk to
our ward.  After the meeting I drove him home. . . . Standing by me, he put his arm over
my shoulder and said:  'My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the
Church, and if he ever tells you to do anything, and it is wrong, and you do it, the Lord
will bless you for it.'  Then with a twinkle in his eye, he said, 'But you don't need to
worry,  The Lord will never let his mouthpiece lead the people astray.'"<a href="#N_17_"><sup> (17)</sup></a></p>
<p align="left">	I hope and pray my young friends that are here 
        today that we will heed and learn from the counsel of our living prophet 
        that we have heard today and throughout your lives.I would like to 
        conclude by sharing one of my own tender experiences with President 
        Hinckley: </p>
<p align="left">	It was about a year and a half ago when I was 
        called to President Hinckley's office to have extended this call to 
        serve as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy. As I concluded that 
        interview and prepared to leave his office, he said, "Please don't 
        leave. I would like to talk to you about something else."</p>
<p align="left">I then sat down and President Hinckley proceeded 
        to tell me that thirty-six years ago, at the home where he raised his 
        children and where one of his married daughters and her family now 
        lives, he planted a walnut tree and it has died. He said, "I was 
        wondering if sometime when your boys have a few minutes if you would 
        mind bringing them up to my home where that tree is and have them look 
        at it and tell me if they think it has any value." </p>
<p align="left">	I called my sons, Ben and Brad, when I got home 
        Friday evening and they called me back Saturday morning. They said, 
        "Dad, we have some time this morning and we'd be happy to go with you up 
        to President Hinckley's home to see if we think the tree has any value." 
        As we drove there Saturday morning, my two sons turned to me and said, 
        "Dad, we have a suggestion that perhaps you would like to make to the 
        prophet." I said, "What is that?"</p>
<p align="left">	They said, "If the lumber in that tree is any 
        good, he might want to consider having the pulpit made out of it for the 
        new conference center." </p>
<p align="left">	After we arrived at his home, he took us around 
        the yard where he raised his family and showed us his garden and 
        orchard. Then we went over to look at the black walnut tree he planted 
        thirty-six years ago.</p>
<p align="left">	There was a question as to whether or not the 
        lumber would be good, because when a tree is cut, water should be kept 
        running on it until the time to cut it up or it will start to dry out 
        and split. As we looked at it, I turned to the President and said, 
        "President, Ben and Brad have a suggestion you may want to consider." He 
        said, "What's that?" I told him if the lumber in this tree is good, the 
        boys suggest you might want to consider having the pulpit for the new 
        conference center made from it.</p>
<p align="left">He said, "I like that idea."</p>
<p align="left">	I told him the boys would have the tree cut down 
        by a professional tree cutter because it is so close to the house that 
        they don't dare cut it down, fearing it might crash into the house and 
        do some damage. Then they will load it on their truck and take it to a 
        mill where they do business. If the lumber is any good, they will have 
        it kiln dried and then you can decide what you would like to do with the 
        lumber. </p>
<p align="left">The next Saturday I received a phone call from 
        one of our sons and he said, "Dad, we are up here at President 
        Hinckley's and have the tree cut down. As we were loading it on the 
        truck, President Hinckley came up to me and said, "Brad, I am very 
        excited about the possibility of having the pulpit made out of that tree 
        like you and Ben suggested to me."</p>
<p align="left">When the boys took the tree to the mill to be cut 
        up, the foreman of the mill told them that the tree had been starved for 
        sunlight. They said, "What do you mean?" He told them that typically a 
        domestic walnut tree will grow three or four feet and then the branches 
        go out; however, because this tree was planted so close to the house and 
        there was a tall, pine tree above that shaded it, the walnut tree 
        continued to grow straight and tall until it got clear above the house 
        before the branches went out. This turned out to be a blessing for when 
        they cut it up, there was not a crack, a split, or a check in it. They 
        were able to obtain 150 board feet of straight, beautiful, walnut lumber 
        without any knotholes which was used to make the pulpit for the 
        beautiful new Conference Center.</p>
<p align="left">	I conclude by pleading with you, by begging you, 
        by counseling you, to please, please listen to the words of our living 
        prophet today, even President Gordon B. Hinckley. He truly is the Lord's 
        mouthpiece that the Lord has sent forth as His oracle on this earth at 
        this day and age in which you and I live. I promise you if you will 
        listen to the words he shares and counsels us with that it will help 
        each of us one day to more fully have the opportunity of returning to 
        the presence of our Father in Heaven and receiving the greatest gift 
        that God has to offer to any of us, even the gift of eternal life. I 
        love the President. I will do anything he asks me to do. But it is my 
        Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ who I worship and testify of this day. 
        I testify that God so loved us that He gave His only Begotten Son in the 
        flesh, and the Firstborn of His spirit to come to this earth and offer 
        Himself as a ransom to fulfill the atonement and the resurrection so 
        that you and I might live. I testify that Christ so loved us that He, a 
        God Himself, gave His life for you and me, to forgive us of our sins and 
        transgressions, our weaknesses, and our follies, to pave the way so we 
        might have life eternal with our Father in Heaven. I worship Him. I love 
        Him. I testify of Him and pray His blessings upon each one of you 
        wonderful, young people that you might know you are those who will 
        continue to help prepare the way for our Savior's return once again when 
        He comes during His millennial reign for time and all eternity with 
        glory and honor, and of which I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
        amen.

A Season of War:<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 LDS Servicemen in World War II<br />
<br />
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Describing the events of his day, the Book of Mormon Prophet Omni wrote: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>And it came to pass that. . .we had many seasons of serious war and bloodshed<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Omni verse 3).&nbsp; He might have been describing our day.&nbsp; The twentieth century was marked with <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
many seasons of serious war.&quot;&nbsp;  World Wars One and Two, Korea, Viet Nam, The Gulf War and  many  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
police actions.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  Today, I will talk about World War II, and some of those who participated in it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">World War II engulfed the earth in the most deadly struggle in recorded history.&nbsp;  Virtually "every nation, tongue and people" were involved.&nbsp; For The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints it was essential that the United States and its allies win this war.&nbsp;  Had the Axis Powers<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>Hitler, Mussolini of Italy, and Japan<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s Tojo 
had their way, the spread of the Gospel would have ceased.&nbsp; But in the 
timetable of the Lord, they had no chance of permanently prevailing. As the Lord 
rhetorically asks:  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Have I not made the earth?&nbsp; Do I not hold the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Doctrine and Covenants 117:6).</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Missionary work by the LDS Church continued in Germany until the fall of 1939.  Beginning in June 1935, my grandfather, Philemon M. Kelly, presided over the Swiss-German Mission, which encompassed all of Switzerland and the western half of Germany.&nbsp; In a letter to my parents, dated 16 September 1936, he writes: [Note the careful language he uses to get the letter through German censorship]  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Thursday spent the entire day traveling to Hamburg.  Had a real conversation with a college professor in which he gave many current views of religion and political conditions as he now saw them in Germany.&nbsp; The entire distance was a pleasant series of surprises as new landscapes and green verdure was everywhere apparent.&nbsp; These dear people are a wonderfully progressive and industrious folk.&nbsp; They are persistently endeavoring to adjust themselves to a new environment found after the (world) war.&nbsp; This they are accomplishing and one is well able to note their progress in the last year.&nbsp; Many soldiers were seen returning from N&uuml;rnberg where they held the Reich<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s Party Tag (day).&nbsp;  This is a wonderful get-together of the present directing class and their many followers.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">My own recollections of this war are limited.&nbsp; I was four years old when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; I remember the stars in the windows of many homes, indicating that a son, or husband, was serving from that home<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>or in many cases, a different colored star, symbolizing a life given in that service.&nbsp; In downtown St. Anthony, Idaho, on May 5, 1945, the day Germany surrendered, people drove up and down Bridge Street honking their horns and shouting out their windows in jubilation.&nbsp; I went home, got in Dad<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s car, parked in the street at the side of our home, and honked the horn until the battery went dead.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">To you young women<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>girls, if you think the ratio of men to women at Ricks College is out of balance now, in the graduating class of 1945 there were <i>no</i> men!</p>
<p align="LEFT"> </p>
<p align="LEFT">As the war progressed, the Church made giant strides as young Latter-day Saint men and women left their communities in "the tops of the mountains" and were thrust into the Allied Armed Forces.&nbsp; As is true of every difficulty the Church and its people have endured, through the trials and hardships of the war the Lord winnowed much grain from the chaff.&nbsp; When these young men were assigned to their units many of their comrades had the opportunity of meeting a Mormon for the first time.&nbsp; I believe that during World War II, with the help of men and women like these,  we saw the Church take steps in its process of coming <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>out of obscurity.&quot;</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Latter-day Saint men fought in every theater of action<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>Europe, Africa, and the Pacific.&nbsp; Some were doctors, some mechanics, pilots, gunners, infantry, officers, or enlisted men.&nbsp; They performed acts of great courage.&nbsp; Some became prisoners of war.&nbsp;  Many have told me they felt the Lord<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s hand moving them <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>out of the way.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  None professes to know why he survived and others did not.&nbsp; Much they had to do was mundane, those things necessary to sustain life.&nbsp; Those sent into battle were required to perform acts unthinkable under any other circumstance; take lives and destroy property.&nbsp; Confronting the temptations found off the battlefield required every bit as much courage as it did to hold steady in the face of the bombs and bullets of combat.&nbsp;  I submit that the faith and trials of these men and women is as significant as that of our pioneer forebears.   </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Seated there are men and women, who, when they were the ages of you young people, closed their books, left their classes, their homes, girlfriends, and in many cases,  young brides, to go fight a bitter war.  Some of their brothers, cousins, or uncles did not come home.&nbsp; It has been a remarkable experience to gather their stories.&nbsp; They are extraordinary people.&nbsp; Only now have some of them been willing to share their experiences.&nbsp; I have laughed, marveled,  and wept with them as they told me their stories.&nbsp; In  a short time they will all have passed to the other side.&nbsp; The debt we owe these men and women is greater than I had imagined (Parenthetically, Thomas Neibaur, who fought in the first World War, the first Mormon to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, was from Sugar City, Idaho).</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Professors Robert Freeman and Dennis Wright who direct the <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font><i>Saints at War<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</i> archival project at Brigham Young University, have written: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>In 1944, at the height of WWII,  over 100,000 LDS Servicemen were in the military.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
   Considering there were then only 860,000 Church members, that is an astonishing number.&nbsp; That is one in nine, or nearly 12% of the total Church.&nbsp; If we assume that only half of these men were living the Gospel<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>and I believe it was much higher than that<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>it was a missionary force of 50,000; nearly as many as we now have with a membership of 11,000,000.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> </p>
<p align="LEFT">While my intent is to tell the stories of those who bore the battle, to understand what they accomplished, you need  a backdrop of events as they unfolded, which affected the course of the war and the lives of the men and women who were the warriors.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The roots of World War II grew out of World War I.&nbsp; The Great War, as it was called, fought largely in France, ended with the signing of the Versailles Treaty on November 11, 1918.&nbsp;  There was no real winner; fatigue and despair stopped the fighting.&nbsp; Billed as the war <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>to end war and  make the world safe for democracy,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  it accomplished neither.&nbsp; Germany, as the primary protagonist, was  assessed huge reparations,  which she was unable to pay.&nbsp; Spiraling inflation, hopelessness,  and the Great Depression gripping the world, led to economic uncertainty and unrest among the German people.&nbsp; By promising to  restore order and national pride, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in 1933. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Hitler bullied his way around Europe, snatching territory and commandeering world headlines, and setting the people of the world on edge with his startling preachments of hatred.&nbsp; In August 1939, Hitler and the Russian dictator Josef Stalin became allies, and a month later, on September 1, 1939, invaded Poland.&nbsp; This brought England, and at England<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s urging, France, into the fight.&nbsp; Neither country was prepared.&nbsp; France shortly fell under the Nazi heel as Hitler<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s armies occupied their land and took over their government.  Then Hitler<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s air force, the Luftwaffe, began to bombard England.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Hitler<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s Italian ally, Benito Mussolini sent  troops to Greece and  North Africa, occupying Libya, Algeria, and Tunisia,  and attempted to seize the Suez Canal.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The United States struggled to remain neutral, but soon became the supplier of materiel under the Lend-Lease program,  pumping aid into Great Britain to help it withstand the German onslaught.&nbsp;  With this the United States  acquired a vital interest in keeping the Atlantic sea lanes open against German submarines.        </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">In June 1941 Hitler turned on Russia in a massive surprise attack that American military leaders predicted  would flatten Russia in a matter of weeks.&nbsp; Whatever Hitler<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s reasons for this change of direction,  it allowed England needed time to prepare.&nbsp; In that, I see the hand of the Lord.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">As early as 1931, Japanese military leaders got control of the government of Japan and launched a large scale military campaign in Manchuria.&nbsp; By 1940 Japan controlled twenty million square miles of land and ocean stretching from Manchuria in the North to Java in the south, and from Burma east to the Marshall Islands.&nbsp;  It was a territory five times as large as Nazi Germany ever dominated.&nbsp; Much of the world<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s attention was focused on the dramatic events in Europe.&nbsp;  Less concern was accorded Japan.&nbsp; Hitler<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s assault on the Soviets relieved the Japanese worry of an attack from Siberia, and Japan moved into Indo-China and Thailand.  Japan then began looking to the Americas.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">On December 8<sup>th</sup> 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in an address to Congress stated,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols"> &#65;</font>Yesterday, December 7, 1941<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
a date which will live in infamy<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64; </font>&nbsp;Within four hours Congress voted to declare war on Japan.&nbsp; Three days later Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, and on December 11<sup>th</sup> , Congress reciprocated, and the United States was at war on two huge fronts.&nbsp; Then began the gargantuan task of inducting men, training, arming and organizing them into the Armies, Navies, and Air Forces necessary to do battle in so many places simultaneously.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
t think it is possible to overstate the distress felt by our people, indeed the people of all the world, at the onslaught of World War II.&nbsp; It was by no means apparent that we would prevail.  Germany and her allies Japan and Italy<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>the Axis powers, were formidable, well trained, ruthless opponents<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>and they had a running start on us everywhere.&nbsp; As we look back we can see pivotal events which we now know turned the tide of war in our favor.&nbsp; For example, at the Battle of Midway,  we sank four Japanese aircraft carriers which the Japanese could never replace, and which were vital to their war making capacity.&nbsp; We did not then know it but that was the beginning of the end of the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Tom Brokaw, anchor of NBC Television News and author of the book <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font><i>The Greatest Generation,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</i> writes that the soldiers of World War II came from the communities of our country, out of the depths of the Great Depression, and entered military service.&nbsp; After rescuing the world from ruthless foes they came home to build this nation to unprecedented economic and material heights.&nbsp; Our Mormon boys were part of this effort.&nbsp;  They came from similar backgrounds, performed similar tasks, took their part in building up this great nation, <i>and</i> participated in spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ around the world.&nbsp; Like those about whom Brokaw writes, our LDS men have been modest in speaking of their wartime experiences, feeling that what they did was not of particular note.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I have learned that there were units of the Church, called LDS Servicemen<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s Groups, established around the globe<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>on the ships at sea, on the islands of the Pacific, in Russia, India, Italy, France, in Prisoner of War camps, and all across the United States.&nbsp; Lieutenant Harold W Gunn, a POW at Stalag Luft III, the camp on which the movie <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font><i>The Great Escape<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</i> was based, told me about a Branch being established in their camp.&nbsp; He said: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>I found it interesting that when the Catholics wished to meet, they had to wait until the Germans were willing to bring in a Priest.&nbsp; It was there I gained an appreciation for the wisdom of the Lord in organizing the Priesthood as He has done in our Church.&nbsp; We were not dependent upon the Germans for the privilege of worshiping.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">With that background in mind, let me relate some of their stories: </p>
<p align="LEFT"> </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Japanese strike on American military forces at Pearl Harbor,  December 7, 1941 was a cunningly conceived, well coordinated, surprise attack.&nbsp; It was <i>the</i> event which galvanized the American people and plunged us into World War II.&nbsp; Days of great moments become imprinted on our minds along with where we were and what we did on a fateful day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">On Sunday, December 7, 1941, <u> <b>Hyrum Kershaw </b></u>had just returned from Church services at the LDS Institute adjacent to the University of Idaho campus in Moscow, when he heard of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The reaction of everyone in the dining hall was stunned silence.  We were all caught off guard.  We had been following events in Europe, but this was an unexpected development.  Suddenly we were at war</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Paul Ray Boren</p>
<p align="LEFT">It was a beautiful morning, with a few clouds over head.  Most of the crew had gone ashore that Sunday morning.  My Division had the duty and I had the assignment as the Officer of the Deck<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s  messenger.  Standing on the well deck we first heard and then saw planes flying in the clouds high above us.  They dived and dropped what we thought were sand bags.  Since we had seen our planes make practice runs before, we didn't think much about it until these <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
sand bags<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 started exploding.  We stood in dumbfounded amazement as we realized they were using live ammunition.    We didn't even think to identify the markings on the planes</p>

<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Our reconnaissance had indicated a Nazi Panzer division was headed down the road toward us.  We were pretty jumpy wondering how much the Germans could muster against our immediate front.  Our Captain took me and Joe Lowe out about a mile beyond our position in the village, to a road junction.  He told us to use nitro starch to blast out foxholes in the frozen ground.  We were left with a bazooka, a Browning Automatic Rifle, grenades, and ammo.  Our assignment in case the Krauts attacked was to hold them off as long as possible to enable our gun battery to retreat.  Makes a guy feel real good knowing he's expendable, like a round of ammunition when you squeeze off the trigger.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Joe and I talked in the stillness.  I noticed him becoming uncomfortable as he said he wanted to ask me something.  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Are you a Mormon?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 he queried.  I answered, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Yes.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Do Mormons believe in God?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Yes.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Do you know how to pray?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Yes.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Will you?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Yes.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I had uttered many silent prayers previously but this was the first time I had done so vocally in front of a member of my unit.  Joe squeezed his eyes shut as we knelt side by side in our hole.  I groped for words to communicate.  As I faltered Joe nudged my ribs, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Be sure to mention we didn't volunteer, we were drafted.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Elmo Seeley</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">My Patriarchal Blessing promised that if I would obey the promptings of the Spirit that I would be all right.  The subtle work of the Spirit kept me safe more than once.  One day a tank began to move up a road when it hit an anti-tank mine.  Our crew was called in to extract it.  The area on both sides of the road was marshy, and the Germans had sown the road with land mines.  Combat engineers came in and cleared away the mines.  The sergeant who was my immediate supervisor may have been the most profane man I have ever known.  I drove our maintenance tank up and was about to enter the road where the disabled tank sat.  I stuck my head through the opening and the sergeant said: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
I don't feel good about your going up that road.  I think you can reach it with the winch and cable if you come through that field.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  I made the approach he suggested and was about to deploy the cable when an officer and his driver passed by in a jeep, and started up the road I had been about to enter.  The jeep hit a mine.  Both men were killed. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I had not felt a warning, and  wondered for many years why it was the Sergeant who "didn't feel good" about my driving up that road.  Finally it came to me that had I said I didn't feel good about walking my tank up that road, this sergeant would have ridiculed my feeling and ordered me to go anyway.  Thus, it was that the Lord kept his promise to me.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Just a word about <b>THE AIR WAR</b> in Europe: </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Losses incurred by the bomber crews in the fall of 1943 and in early 1944 it nearly overwhelmed the United States capacity to replace these men and their equipment.&nbsp; During this period the German Luftwaffe dominated the skies.&nbsp;  An American led raid on the ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt and the aircraft factories at Regensburg resulted in losses of twenty-five percent in one day.  Some 600 highly trained crew members were lost on the second Schweinfurt attack.&nbsp; Bomber pilots told of being able to find their way home by watching the burning planes which had crashed.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">On a low level raid over the Ploesti oil fields in Romania, one Squadron lost seventeen of its thirty-six bombers.&nbsp; Despite those losses the raiders knocked out 70 percent of the production of this oil field, so vital to the Nazis.&nbsp; Given their loss ratios, it is a wonder that the men were willing to make these flights.&nbsp; That they did is remarkable.  </p>

<p align="LEFT">After being liberated we were trucked to Regensburg, where we were deloused and could take a hot shower, given physical exams and issued new and <b>clean</b> clothing.  We were then flown to Camp Lucky Strike at LaHarve, France, where on June 1<sup>st</sup> I boarded the Liberty Ship <u>USS Porpoise</u>, bound for New Jersey, the United States of America.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">As we steamed past the Statue of Liberty and saw the beautiful American flag, I got a lump in my throat and tears flowed down my cheeks.  Not wanting 2800 former POW<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s to see me crying, I wiped my eyes with my hanky, then turned around and saw that everyone else was also drying their eyes </p>

<p align="LEFT">Ralf T. Wilson</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I was paralyzed with fear.  Our captors had not yet arrived but anxiety stuck in my throat.  I needed help beyond myself.  Remembering my parents<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
 teachings I  determined to go off by myself and pray.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the jungle I came upon an old quarry.  It was a beautiful spot.  I knelt and opened my heart to the Lord, pleading for His help.  After a time I heard a very clear and distinct voice say, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
It<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s okay Ralf, you<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
re going to be all right.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  Immediately, a sense of peace washed over me.  The sun was shining through the trees, the birds were singing, I could hear the chatter of monkeys, and  felt a sense of peace and quiet assurance.  The memory of this experience stayed with me from that moment.  Through the vicissitudes of the next three and a half years I never doubted that I would go home.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Marine Lieutenant Ted Tuttle</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">At 10:30 a.m., on D-day plus five, Lt. Shrier led a 40-man platoon up the hill and we took Mt. Suribachi.  This was Japanese territory and when we took it we raised the American flag.  While we watched from below I  experienced a thrill  as I saw that flag go up.  Our Colonel led the men in three hip-hip-hoorays; it was a great event, but it was a small flag and could be seen for only a short distance.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Colonel turned to me and said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#62;</font>
Tuttle, go down to the ships along the beach and get a large battle flag.  It will raise everybody<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s  spirits to see our flag.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">When Lt. Tuttle returned with the flag, it was taken to the top of Suribachi by Colonel Johnson<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s runner,  PFC Rene Gagnon.  As the six men raised the flag, photographer and newsman Joe Rosenthal turned and snapped  pictures.  He captured the  dramatic action in that photograph which is now world famous, and won for Mr. Rosenthal the Pulitzer Prize.  The Marine Corp statue in Washington D.C. is modeled from it.   </p>

<p align="LEFT">There were also LDS Servicemen in Allied and Enemy Countries. . . . .</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Missionary work in Europe had been going on almost since the Restoration of the Gospel took place.&nbsp; By 1939, Germany was third highest in Church membership, behind the United States and Canada.    </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">In our twelfth <i>Article of Faith, </i>Joseph Smith wrote:  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  In conformity to this pronouncement, men in countries allied, or enemy to the United States of America responded to the call of their government.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Horst Peter Prison</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">As I listened to Horst Prison tell his story I was struck by how matter-of-factly he spoke.&nbsp; There was no anger or rancor as he told of the atrocities he witnessed or the injustices he experienced.&nbsp; I was awe struck, nearly in tears.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Horst was drafted into Hitler<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s army and among those invading France in May 1940.&nbsp; After the German Blitzkrieg swept the French and English armies to the beaches of Dunkirk, Hitler ordered a halt.  With the men of his unit, Horst watched the British arrive in every conceivable kind of water craft to rescue  those 250,000 men.&nbsp; It startled me when Horst told me <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>If Hitler would have let us destroy the English and French troops huddled on Dunkirk we (meaning Germany) would have won the war.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">In 1941 he was included in the invasion force which attacked Russia.&nbsp; The Lord is mindful of His saints in whatever uniform they wear.  Horst relates: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>On December 17, 1941 we were fighting near the town of Istra, about five miles before Moscow.&nbsp; That<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s where I froze my feet and had to go to a field hospital.&nbsp; Others I saw had their noses or their hands frozen, some froze up their feet completely.&nbsp; From there I was transferred to Poland where I stayed in the hospital for seven months.&nbsp;   My feet were almost black.&nbsp;  The doctor wanted to amputate.&nbsp; I told him to wait a day or two.&nbsp;  I prayed to my Heavenly Father.&nbsp; The doctor came in the next morning and saw that my feet were getting just a little color.&nbsp; So my feet didn't get amputated.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT">Horst and Elfriede were married in January 1944, and six weeks later he returned to the Russian front.&nbsp; In August that same year Horst was captured by the Russians.&nbsp; When the war ended in May 1945 they continued to detain him at slave labor until December 1949<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
four years after the end of the war.&nbsp;  The last two years of his enslavement he worked on a huge dam, all built by hand, in the Caucasus Mountains. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I quote now from the interview: In Elfriede<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s words,</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">When he came home, that<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s something else!  His mom, his father, and one of his cousins went with me to the railway station.  There were two guys came out of the train, one left right away.  The other one stood there.  We passed him.  I said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Wait a minute.  That was him!<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  I went back, and sure enough, it was Horst.  But, you wouldn't have recognized him<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>no hair, broken teeth, dirty, unshaven.  He was so swollen up, (from malnutrition) you couldn't believe it.  He talked and talked <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#62;</font>till we came home, and then he didn't open his mouth anymore.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I asked: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Were you happy to see him?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">She replied: </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Well, I<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>ll tell you honestly.  It was a strange man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#67;</font>really.  It was awfully hard in the beginning.  We met when he was a young man.  He was nice and gentle, but here he comes back; at first he didn't speak, and then every little thing, he was upset and screams.  Just a different man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>a stranger.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Horst: </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The army changed me.  All that fighting and all those dead, you see.  Guys got killed to my right, to my left, behind me, to the front of me.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">In April, 1952 Horst, Elfriede, and their daughter came to the United States, finally settling in Montana.&nbsp; Earlier I told you about  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Bee<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 Peck, the American soldier who lost his legs when a German shell went through the tank he was driving.&nbsp; In 1978, Bee became Bishop of the Lewistown Ward, in central Montana.&nbsp;  In a  wonderful irony, Horst Peter Prison, former German soldier, [93] served for a time as Bishop Peck<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s Executive Secretary.&nbsp;  They became good friends.</p>

<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I wish I could describe the way these Italian people have been acting as we have been advancing, pushing the Krauts back.  They go hog wild.  They stand along the roads on both sides and wave, shake hands, shout, sing, ring church bells, throw flowers, paper, bread, food, etc., to us.  They treat us like kings.  Yesterday we were on the march and it was raining to beat heck, and by george, those people stood in the rain and cheered and shouted, shook hands with us and really showed us that they are glad to see us.  Naturally it makes us feel swell...  I'm so happy about this <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#62;</font>
war news<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
 that I can't hardly sit still long enough to write this letter. . . Your loving son<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>Cyril.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The influence of our LDS Servicemen on their associates was wide ranging.&nbsp; During my mission, a decade following the war, I met many who told me that during the War they had a buddy who was a Mormon.&nbsp; Who can tell the extent which the combined efforts of all who served in that war have had during their lives in building the Kingdom.&nbsp; They have served in every position in the Church, as Home Teachers, Scout Masters, Bishops, Stake, Temple, and Mission Presidents and General Authorities.&nbsp; Their example and strength has helped move the Church toward its prophesied destiny.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> </p>
<p align="LEFT">None of this could have happened had not the Axis Powers been halted by the sacrifice offered up by the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of World War II.&nbsp; The soldiers of World War II kept intact for us the supernal gift of freedom, so that we can continue to exercise our agency<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>the gift with which even our Eternal Father will not interfere, and which the Gospel of Jesus Christ is designed to protect and preserve.        </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Personally I have not known the terrible terror of war, or the panic of combat, nor have I experienced the horror of seeing a comrade blown to pieces.&nbsp; I<i> have</i> seen the suffering of the wounded and  helped carry the caskets of soldiers and airmen.&nbsp; War is an enormous waste of lives, of our nation<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s resources and our coin. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">This is not to say that war is never necessary.&nbsp; Alma records the viciousness of the warring Lamanites, who <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>did smite [the Nephites] in their fierce anger.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  About the defenders he records: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Nevertheless, [they] were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy  nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church. . . .the Lord has said that: ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  It is our right and responsibility to protect. . .our <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>families, [our] lands, [our] country, [our] rights, and [our] religion<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Alma 43: 45-47, emphasis added).</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I believe it proper to reverently remember those who have borne the brunt of battle.&nbsp; Some years ago I took part in a project to honor the alumni of Ricks College who died in the wars occurring since its establishment in 1888.&nbsp; On November 11, 1988, Elder Lionel Kendrick, of the Seventy, dedicated the memorial which hangs on a wall in the Manwaring Center.&nbsp;  In his opening remarks he told us  he felt impressed to say that the Lord was allowing those noble men honored that day to be in attendance with us.&nbsp; After the demands of the day slowed, I went to the wall where the plaques are mounted.&nbsp;  Alone, I approached the memorial.&nbsp; As I did  I felt the presence of those men.&nbsp; I sensed their thanks for our recognizing their sacrifice, for remembering that what they did for us matters to us.&nbsp; Today, we say thank you to these wonderful men and women who are here with us.&nbsp;  What you did has mattered profoundly to us.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Unfortunately we have not finished having <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>wars and rumors of war.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  As told in scripture, dreadful battles will yet occur.&nbsp; &quot;So, amid the conflict whether great or small, do not be discouraged, God is over all<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, #241).  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&nbsp;&#65;</font>For the day of the Lord of hosts soon cometh upon all nations. . .And upon every people. . .And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down. . .And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  (Isaiah 2: 12, 14, 16).&nbsp; That day He will invite <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>all to come unto Him and partake of His goodness<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (2 Nephi 26: 33).&nbsp; Peace will envelop the earth as the waters cover the seas, and the righteous will find rest in Him.&nbsp; Then will He avenge the blood of the saints and will not suffer their cries any longer (Mormon 8:41).  Christ will reign in our midst, and <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>nations shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (2 Nephi 12: 4).</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0">I very much appreciate the invitation to speak to you today. President and Sister
Bednar have been gracious and thoughtful hosts. At BYU we are following with great
interest the transformation that is taking place on this campus to bless the lives of more
young people in the Church. You are entering some exciting as well as challenging times
as you move from a two-year to a four-year institution. I am confident you have the right
man at the helm of the college to lead you in this new phase of development. I had the
privilege of seeing President Bednar in action on several occasions as the various Church
institutions met with the Board of Trustees. From what I observed, members of the Board
have remarkable confidence and trust in President Bednar. He is clearly a man of unusual
vision, creativity, energy, faith and integrity.
		</p>
<p align="left">The invitation to speak to you caused me to dig into the biographical writings of
my wife Claralyn's father, Joseph Eddy Martin who graduated from Ricks 63 years ago
in 1937. It was informative to note some of the contrasts between then and now.
		</p>
<p align="left">Those were difficult times as the country was pulling out of a devastating
depression. Unemployment was rampant. No one had money. The college faced serious
financial pressures and it was not clear that it would remain a private, Church-related
school or be taken over by the state of Idaho. </p>
<p align="left">Eddy Martin started attending classes in 1934 after his mission. Like so many
other people, he had a difficult time finding work  no part-time employment was
available especially for single people. He couldn't attend fall and spring terms because he
was needed at his family's farm in Menan for the harvest and planting. The family had
already mortgaged the farm to send Eddy on a mission to the Southern States. They had
no money left for college. So he had to borrow $125 from a family friend for that first
quarter at Ricks. </p>
<p align="left">He brought from home  fast-food had not been invented then (that's hard for a
college student today to comprehend!) nor could it have been afforded in any case. Most
students didn't have money to even buy groceries from the store  food came from the
family farms. But "we ate well," he said. In his second quarter, a year later, he reports
that he finally got a part-time job cleaning the offices of the president of the college. That
at least paid for tuition. </p>
<p align="left">One of his roommates, Ted Parkinson, could not afford a winter
coat  it's hard to
imagine a winter in Rexburg without a warm coat. So as to not bother his roommates by
studying when they were sleeping, Ted would walk to campus at 4 a.m., climb through a
window in one of the buildings and find a warm place to study. The janitors were very
understanding. </p>
<p align="left">Students helped each other out. Their hardships seemed to bring them together.
Eddy Martin blossomed at Ricks. He became an excellent debater and the editor of the
		<em>Rixida</em>, the college yearbook. He notes, President Bednar, that the entire costs for
typesetting, layout, photography, printing, binding, shipping, etc., came to
$650  it's
probably a bit more than that today. He expresses in his writings the closeness he felt to
his instructors and associates  Ricks is noted for that kind of closeness. He kept in
contact with many of his Ricks' friends over his 87 years. He became the valedictorian of
the 1937 graduating class of about 70 people. Just before the graduation ceremonies that
year, he wrote in his journal that Commissioner Franklin L. West, Church Board of
Education, announced in the <em>Purple Blaze</em> that the Board had decided that Ricks College
would be continue to be maintained as a Church school. The state of Idaho refused to
take over responsibilities for the campus.</p>
<p align="left">Although Eddy Martin went on to two more years at BYU after graduating from
here, he always spoke glowingly of his days at Ricks. He and his wife Sarah, toward the
later years of their lives, remembering the depression and its attendant financial
hardships, set up trusts for each of their 40 grandchildren to enable them, if they desired,
to serve missions and to attend college. They also set up an endowment to provide
scholarships to several Ricks college students each year.</p>
<p align="left">My wife, one of seven daughters of Eddy and Sarah Martin, inherited the
frugality of her parents. Let me illustrate. A couple of years ago, our mainly brick house
in Provo needed the trim to be painted. Since an estimate by a professional painter said it
would cost us about $3,000, Claralyn asked me if perhaps I would like doing the job
      myself "Think of the money we could save!" Now I don't mind painting, but the main
difficulty I saw was with the height. Our home is three stories tall and, of course, most of
the trim is on the upper story. I demanded a recount of the vote but the "dimpled chads"
unfortunately swung the vote in her direction. So, I was elected. </p>
<p align="left">With the money saved, I bought a tall extension ladder, lots of paint, brushes,
scrapers and other supplies. All went well on the lower levels. But then I eventually had
to get to the very top of the house. My ladder would not reach. Not to worry. Anyone
with a PhD and normal household items should be able to tackle any of life's problems.
After considering available resources, I decided to drag a wooden picnic table to the
appropriate spot and placed the extension ladder on top of it. But I encountered two
additional problems: First, the picnic table plus the ladder, fully extended, still did not
permit me to quite reach the peak. And second, the ground sloped putting everything at
an angle. What to do? In the garage I found some leftover bricks and some long 2x4s. By
stacking the bricks to the appropriate height, I could compensate for the sloping ground
while giving me a foot or so of extra height. By putting the long 2x4s over the bricks, the
picnic table on the boards and the ladder on the picnic table, I figured I could finally
reach those upper levels.</p>
<p align="left">It was time to ascend my engineering masterpiece  bucket of paint tied carefully
around my neck, paintbrush and scraper in my hand, ladder tightly grasped by the other
hand. As I looked down from the top, it appeared to me that I was several thousand feet
above my yard below. Holding onto the ladder for dear life, I carefully reached up to
scrape and paint those upper corners. I had the distinct sense that the slightest slip on my
part would not only result in paint smearing over onto the bricks but in a very rapid
descent that would likely land me in the hospital or, possibly, morgue. </p>
<p align="left">I then realized two things  first, how foolish I was not to let the experts do this
work and, second, how thankful I was that my ladder, picnic table, 2x4s and bricks had
integrity  I trusted them to perform their functions and they did. I was glad the unseen
ladder manufacturer left no weak spot on that ladder that would cause it to buckle under
pressure. The table did not give way. The bricks and the boards held under pressure. 
		</p>
<p align="left">I quickly but very carefully finished my work at that high elevation and, I am
happy to report, descended to ground level without incident. I am even more pleased to
inform you that next time this kind of work is needed, Claralyn has given me permission
to call in experts who have not only experience in this type of stunt work but also great
insurance coverage.</p>
<p align="left">I also made the observation in painting some areas, that parts of the wood trim
looked fine from the exterior but the interior was rotted away. I could push my finger
right through the wood. It lacked integrity. It appeared all right from the outside but its
purpose of providing insulation and moisture protection had been compromised. I had to
replace several sections.</p>
<p align="left">What do we mean by the concept of  "integrity?" Integrity of a metal means that
the metal has certain measurable qualities throughout. If it lacks integrity, the metal has a
flaw that may not be seen by the naked eye but may cause the metal to fail when pressure
is applied. Integrity of a tool means that the tool will perform in accordance with its
specifications. It has consistent qualities that can be measured and tested. The ladder, for
example, was certified to support so many pounds of weight  and it did. It performed
under pressure.  </p>
<p align="left">The integrity of a person is the measure of how consistent that person is from the
inside to the outside. A person of high integrity is what he claims himself to be. Such a
person of integrity performs under the pressure of real and demanding situations
       not
just when it is easy. It's one thing to be a ladder standing in my garage; but the real test
of that ladder is when it has to perform under pressure. Likewise it is relatively easy to
claim to stand for certain values when the pressure is off  but much more difficult to live
those values when life's pressures come.</p>
<p align="left">Let's be more specific to you and me. It is relatively easy to proclaim to be a
follower of Christ. The person of integrity, however, will not only proclaim outwardly to
follow the Savior but will, under the pressures of life, demonstrate attributes of the
Savior on a consistent basis, day in and day out. Internally that person of integrity will be
Christ-like so that, no matter what the challenges, principles taught by the Savior will
come through  whether in a group or alone, in public or in private, on Sunday or on
Monday, in church or in a sales room.  </p>
<p align="left">I submit to you that one of the most important things you can do in this life is to
become a person of integrity. Most of you are already doing a wonderful job of that right
now. At Ricks you are known as people of integrity and I commend you for it. The world
desperately needs people of integrity. Let's talk about how we might always remain
people of integrity. </p>
<p align="left">The Lord speaking about Joseph Smith's brother said these loving words:
"blessed is my servant, Hyrum Smith, for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity
of his heart." (D&amp;C 124:15)</p>
<p align="left">Loyal and true Hyrum! He was faithful to the Gospel and completely devoted to
the Prophet Joseph throughout their lives. He was tried and tested and proved faithful
under all challenges  even at the very end when he joined Joseph in sealing his
testimony with his blood in Carthage, Illinois.</p>
<p align="left">The Lord evidently highly values integrity. He promised great blessings to
Solomon if he "will walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of
heart" (I Kings 9:4) Unfortunately, David did not retain his integrity throughout his
life.</p>
<p align="left">Job is held up as a man who "holds his integrity" in spite of numerous 
challenges. (Job 2:3)</p>
<p align="left">There are many examples of people of integrity (and some who lack it) in modern
times. May I illustrate from my own observations related to the business world? See if
you can see what lessons we might glean from them. </p>
<p align="left">I recently attended the funeral of my friend Lowell Benson, Executive Vice
President of the O.C. Tanner Company and their chief buyer of diamonds and gold. He
was also a stake president in Salt Lake City and a great friend and graduate of BYU and
the Marriott School of Management. His funeral packed a large stake center. I was
curious to see that people attended from the diamond capitals of the world: Antwerp and
Johannesburg. Their messages were read at the funeral. I paraphrase,  "We knew Lowell
as an excellent man of business. More importantly, he was a man of integrity. He drove a
hard bargain but he could always be trusted to keep his word."</p>
<p align="left">Jon Huntsman, Sr., is one of the most successful businessmen in America. (His
corporate jet enables President Hinckley to travel the world.) He has founded a number
of companies in the republics of the former Soviet Union. Two of his former employees
were in my MBA class at BYU and told me of the box factory he created in Russia to
help this emerging economy. Initially the company was told it would have to pay a
certain tax rate on boxes sold to Russian customers and a much lower rate on boxes
shipped for resale to other former republics. After the company started producing boxes,
a tax administrator came and informed the company that the rates were being increased
on the exported boxes  to a point that made the company completely unprofitable.
However, the official said, if certain amounts could be paid under the table directly to the
tax official, he could "take care of them." It is Jon Huntsman's policy never to pay a
bribe. He never has, he never will. The official was insistent. Jon Huntsman decided to
sell the factory to local management for one dollar rather than pay a bribe. He lost his
investment of millions of dollars but he would not compromise his integrity for money.</p>
<p align="left">Recently one of our top BYU MBA graduates accepted one of the most lucrative
jobs of the year with a prestigious company. He and his wife moved to a large city and
were enjoying the prospects of a rapid move up the success ladder. But he was asked to
engage in business practices that compromised his integrity. His supervisor wanted him
to make significant misrepresentations to customers. He approached his superiors and
told them he could not do what they were asking him to do. He was fired. He spent
several months out of work. Fortunately, he finally did get another very good
      job  even
better than the first.</p>
<p align="left">An accounting clerk at a large university became a respected member of his
      profession  even holding a high office in his professional association. He was active in
his church and community and had a good family. One day he discovered how he could
take small amounts from the university without anyone noticing. He told himself that he
was underpaid anyway  and besides, he would only use the money a short while and
then return it. But the next month, more money was needed. Just a little more would not
      matter  he'd pay that back, too. The months stretched into years. The total amount taken
swelled to several hundred thousand dollars. Then came the day when an audit uncovered
his fraud. His reputation was shattered. His career came to an end. His family
disintegrated. Ties with his church were broken. Where once he was a respected member
of the community, now he was a common criminal unworthy of the trust and confidence
of any employer. </p>
<p align="left">Two partners in an e-commerce start-up company negotiated a contract with a
large company to provide their customers seminars on this new field. The large firm
provided seed money to help the small company get started. A few months later, the
partners realized that, under the terms of the contract, they owed the large company about
$40,000. If that amount had to be paid immediately, the small company would have to
shut its doors. The original intent of the contract would not have required payment, but
the wording of the contract was such that the small firm owed the $40,000. At the same
time this was discovered, the large company changed the manager who was responsible
for the contract. He probably did not know of the contents of the contract nor of the
intent. The two partners had a choice  if they told the new manager about the $40,000,
they could have to pay it and lose their company. If they did not tell him, the new
manager may never find out and they could stay in business. The partners said to each
other, "It's only money. We built our company on the principles of integrity. We can't let
money stand in the way of that principle." They called the new manager and explained
the situation. He asked for a few days to consider the matter. He later called back and
said, "You have been men of integrity. We find that a rare commodity in today's
business. Because we now know we can trust you, we want you to keep the $40,000."
That year, the small company did over one million dollars in business with the large
company and the relationship continued at that level for many years.</p>
<p align="left">A father was preparing his taxes late one night. He had assembled all the
appropriate records and worked hard to determine what he owed the IRS  never the
most joyful experience in life. When all was computed, he found that he qualified for a
small refund. But then he suddenly remembered a transaction. He had been paid for one
fairly large job in cash. No records were made of the transaction. He realized that the IRS
couldn't have received a report of this income and likely would never know about it.
Reporting it would cost him over $1,000 in state and federal taxes  a sizeable amount to
his young and growing family. But then he thought, "I am a man of integrity. This is a
small price to pay for resting well at night knowing I have been honest." He had to take
out a short-term loan from the bank but he paid the extra taxes and slept well.</p>
<p align="left">Now, what can we learn about integrity from these stories? You probably drew
your own conclusions. Let me suggest a few of mine. First, integrity usually extracts a
price. To be a person of integrity we must be willing to pay that price. It cost Jon
Huntsman literally millions of dollars. It cost the MBA student his job. Neither had any
hope of monetary reward for living with integrity.  </p>
<p align="left">Second, living with integrity may bring recognition from the
      world  but not
necessarily. People came from Belgium and South Africa to honor Lowell Benson for his
life of integrity. The start-up company was rewarded with millions in revenues because
they established a relationship of integrity with a customer. A recruiter told me the other
day that his firm came to BYU to find employees because he knew they were well-trained and had integrity. But worldly recognition is not necessarily the case nor should it
be expected. The young father was not rewarded with public acclaim but with a clear
conscience, peace of mind and a good night's sleep. </p>
<p align="left">Third, the decision to live with integrity is not always the easiest path to
      follow  especially if one measures decisions by worldly standards. The MBA student's
decision to leave a prestigious firm over an issue some might consider "just business"
would not have been considered wise by worldly career consultants. Sometimes living
with integrity bring pain.</p>
<p align="left">Fourth, people generally don't set out to intentionally lose their integrity. Loss of
integrity comes usually very slowly, a small step at a time. The accountant did not intend
to defraud his employer, only to be "fairly compensated." He just took a little at first. He
always intended to pay it back. He never considered himself a "bad man" or one who
lacked integrity.</p>
<p align="left">Fifth, loss of integrity can bring devastating consequences that go far beyond the
incident where integrity is compromised. The accountant lost everything he valued: his
family, his church, his career, his respect in the community, his friends and, for a time,
his freedom.</p>
<p align="left">Think of the ills in our society caused by a lack of integrity. Families are torn
apart when a husband or wife lacks integrity in upholding marriage covenants. Children
become alienated from parents when there is lack of integrity in the family unit. 
		</p>
<p align="left">Countries are destroyed when law enforcement officials lack integrity in
upholding laws. We recently sponsored a student from Armenia, one of the former
republics of the Soviet Union. She was amazed when we told her if she ever needed help,
she could ask a policeman to assist her. "In my country," she said, "one would not dare
go to a policeman for help. No one trusts the police. They take bribes. They might harm
you before they would help." The lack of integrity in this country has almost brought
commerce to a standstill.  </p>
<p align="left">Think of the billions lost each year in the retail trade in the U.S. due to
shoplifting. It is a sad note that for most retailers, the majority of their losses come from
employees rather than dishonest customers.</p>
<p align="left">And think of further billions in aid that is sent to underdeveloped countries in
Africa and elsewhere. What a tragedy that such a high percentage is siphoned off by
corrupt political leaders rather than benefiting the people who so desperately need this
assistance.</p>
<p align="left">Now we may not be able to exert much influence on some of these very large
problems  but we can start by changing ourselves and maybe, just maybe, that will help
the world be a little bit better. </p>
<p align="left">How can we become or continue to be people of integrity? I suggest to you a
principle borrowed from an investment expert, Alan Folkman of Oregon who was our
most recent Distinguished Alumnus in the Marriott School of Management. </p>
<p align="left">It is said that Albert Einstein called this principle "one of the most powerful
forces in the universe." The principle I am speaking of is compound interest. Here's an
example of it. Did you know that if you started saving $200 a month from the time you
start work at age 25 and continue until age 70, you will have accumulated over
$1,000,000 (at 8%). Now you really only put aside a little over $100,000. Where did the
rest come from? Interest on the first $200, then interest on the second $200 plus more
interest on the first $200, etc. </p>
<p align="left">Further do you know what happens of if you delay the start of that savings until
age 45? Now you're saving more than half the time of the first example but you only end
up with $200,000 in the end 1/5 the amount. Why? Much less interest on interest
because of the shorter time.</p>
<p align="left">Another example, if someone  say a thoughtful ancestor
       had put $1.00 (just
ONE DOLLAR) in 1776 in an account for you earning 8% per year, you would have
about $31,000,000 today! Too bad our ancestors didn't do that for us!</p>
<p align="left">You've all heard the story about Manhattan Island, New York, being purchased in
1626 by Peter Minuit from the Manhattan Indians for $24 worth of beads and trinkets.
What a steal!? Perhaps not. If those Indians had invested that $24 at just 6% in some
mutual fund, today that would be worth $70 billion. If they had been able to average 8%
a year, that $24 would today be worth $76 trillion!!</p>
<p align="left">What does that have to do with integrity? Alan Folkman suggested that just as
substantial investment returns are accumulated over a long period of small, consistent
investments, integrity is accumulated and compounded through the investment of small
acts of honesty, consistency, and faithfulness. Small efforts at obedience, small measures
of forgiveness, honesty in very small things, small attempts to follow the Savior, when
practiced over many years, become ingrained in us forming eventually steel chords of a
great soul of integrity. Then when the tests of life come  and they surely will come to all
of us  that great soul of integrity will prove itself equal to the challenges.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, the converse is also true. Small acts of dishonesty, small lies, small
thefts, small gossip, can also be compounded over time to the detriment of our souls.</p>
<p align="left">Perhaps this process of compounding is what the Lord had in mind when he spoke
of the ten virgins. The five wise ones had saved up oil, drop by drop, perhaps over years.
Starting early brings a much greater benefit than starting too late. The five foolish virgins
who delayed found, like those who start saving late in life money or integrity, they could
not possibly make up the difference. For them it was everlastingly too late.</p>
<p align="left">How do we know of we are becoming a person of integrity? Let me give some
possible questions to ask ourselves to determine if we are on that road to integrity. These
are the small things that we must do over and over to eventually become great souls of
integrity.</p>
<p align="left">Am I honest in school assignments? Would I ever pass off work as mine when
actually it was created by another? Would I ever take from another that which I should
not without fair compensation  for example, do I use pirated computer software? Do I
make illegal copies of copyrighted materials such as music or published articles?</p>
<p align="left">Is there integrity in my business dealings? If I received more than I should have,
in a business transaction would I return the excess? Would I ever represent my product to
a potential customer as something it is not?</p>
<p align="left">Does my dating comply with the principles of integrity? Do I help my date uphold
principles to which we have committed our lives?</p>
<p align="left">Am I honest in my taxes? Am I honest in my tithing and fast offerings? Am I
honest in my relationship with my employer? Can I be counted to provide an hour's work
for an hour's pay? Can I be completely trusted with my employers assets? </p>
<p align="left">Can I be trusted with another's reputation  in other words, can I be trusted to
avoid gossiping about another? Am I a true friend when that friend is not around?</p>
<p align="left">How do I behave when no one is watching, when no one can find out what I did? 
		</p>
<p align="left">When I give my word, can it be relied upon implicitly? When I make a
commitment, do I keep it? When I make a sacred covenant, do I uphold my vows?</p>
<p align="left">While it takes years to become a proven person of integrity, it is so easy to lose
integrity  and so difficult to restore it. Nephi warned us that it is easy to "lie a little,
take advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor, there is no harm in
this" we might be tempted to say. (2 Nephi 28:8)</p>
<p align="left">How do you know when you are losing your integrity? The still, small voice will
tell you, the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. I promise you that if you listen and heed its
warning, you will know clearly if you are getting on the wrong track and need to make a
course correction. In contrast, if we ever become too busy or too insensitive to listen,
then we may find ourselves as Laman and Lemuel. Nephi said of them: "and he hath
spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling that ye could not feel his
words." (1 Nephi 17:45)</p>
<p align="left">I suggest to you that, while we have many examples of people of integrity all
around us, we must look to the Savior to see the perfect example of a man of integrity.
Throughout his life, he never wavered from doing his Father's will. He was the same
inside and out  what he preached was exactly what he practiced. He never feared nor
sought the opinions of the world but steadfastly carried out his divine mission. He stood
ever ready to pay whatever price His integrity demanded  ultimately paying that
enormous, incomprehensible price for us in Gethsemane and then on Calvary. He refused
to  "shrink" but drank from the bitter cup that was placed before him.</p>
<p align="left">I know he lives and leads this Church today through a living prophet, President
Gordon B. Hinckley. What a great blessing we have to have this great prophet of
integrity leading us today  both the Church and this wonderful institution, Ricks
College. I testify that those who serve with President Hinckley  his counselors President
Monson and President Faust, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Seventy  are also men of
complete integrity, worthy of our trust and support. I have had the blessing of seeing
these men close up and testify of their divine callings. I testify that Joseph Smith was a
great man of integrity, the prophet of the restoration.</p>
<p align="left">I know that it is worth whatever price we must pay to become people of integrity.
The world needs you to become such a person. The Lord needs to rely on us as people of
integrity so that we may bless his children. Oh, how sweet it would be to have the Savior
say of you and me:</p>
<p align="left">"blessed [are you] for I, the Lord, love [you] because of the integrity of [your] heart."</p>
<p align="left">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
