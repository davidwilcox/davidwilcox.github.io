<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.<br /><br />In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is good to be with you on another great day at BYU-Idaho. Sister Clark and I express our gratitude to the Lord for the opportunity to serve with you. We love you very much.<br /><br />I want to speak to you today about the purposes and the power of the Honor Code used throughout the Church Educational System (CES). The elements of the Honor Code are familiar to you. For example, they are included almost entirely in&nbsp;<em>For the Strength of Youth</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Missionary Handbook</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />I rejoice at this privilege to speak to you who are so good, so obedient, and so choice in the eyes of the Lord. Great blessings come from obedience. You know this because of your own experience. You keep the commandments and your commitments to live the Honor Code because of your personal integrity and your faith in the Lord and His promises. Your faithful obedience invites the Spirit on this campus and thus is a great blessing to all who work and study here.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is the desire of my heart that what I say today will help you increase your understanding of the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code and to be even more obedient and faithful in keeping your commitments and your covenants.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Parable of the Prodigal Son</strong><br />My starting point today is the contrast between two very different choices made in the parable of the prodigal son. Although you are not prodigals, you all face the choices described in the Savior's parable about a son who asked for his inheritance from his father and then "<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng" target="_self">wasted</a>&nbsp;his substance with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng" target="_self">riotous</a>&nbsp;living."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the language of the Book of Mormon, the prodigal son "became for [himself]."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He sought to do his own will and turned toward selfish desires and the pleasures of the world. He chose darkness instead of light.&nbsp;<br /><br />After the prodigal son wasted his inheritance, he survived by tending swine. In this sorry state, he recognized the wrongs he had done and who he really was. As the Savior taught, the prodigal son "came to himself."<sup>3</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_08_Clark.htm#_edn3" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;He chose to repent, to turn away from selfishness and sin and turn to God, to his home, and to his true identity.&nbsp;<br /><br />In our lives we face this choice very often: are we going to "become for ourselves," turn to selfish desires and the darkness of unrighteousness? Or are we going to "come to ourselves," turn to Christ and the light of the gospel? Sometimes that choice can be hard to see and to make because Satan does everything in his power to disguise the darkness of evil with fun and excitement. Our selfish, worldly desires can seem very attractive.&nbsp;<br /><br />The prodigal son reveled in the pleasures of the world for a while, and then he found the pain and darkness they bring. Yet our Heavenly Father did not leave him alone and adrift in his confusion and suffering, and He does not leave us alone either. As Elder Robert D. Hales has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Throughout our lives, whether in times of darkness, challenge, sorrow, or sin, we may feel the Holy Ghost reminding us that we are truly sons and daughters of a caring Heavenly Father, who loves us, and we may hunger for the sacred blessings that only He can provide. At these times we should strive to&nbsp;<em>come to ourselves</em>&nbsp;and come back into the light of our Savior's love.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Too often we get so caught up in the things of the world and neglect the things of God so much that we do not notice that little by little our vision has become clouded, our perspective constrained, and our understanding darkened. It is as if a brown fog of worldliness slowly covers our eyes and our lives, and we begin to wander into the darkness of sin.&nbsp;<br /><br />That is not the plan! It is not the way! We can turn to Christ; break out of that fog; and find the pure, illuminating light of His gospel. With it comes color! And clarity! And perspective! And understanding! And joy in Christ! Through the Atonement of Christ, we can receive that buoyant, life-giving freedom from the chains of sin, from despair, and from the brown film of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a pattern I want you to use to understand and live the Honor Code<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;at BYU-Idaho. Take a moment and look at the elements of the CES Honor Code on the screen. They are part of the new Honor Code website launched by the university this morning. As you can see, every aspect of the Honor Code is connected to the Savior and His gospel. The Honor Code helps you "come to yourself" and turn to Christ so that He may protect you from evil and prepare you to be His true disciples and leaders in your families, in your communities, and in the kingdom of God.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Protection and Preparation</strong><br />Protection and preparation are supernal blessings. Consider first the blessing of protection. You and I live in a war zone. In fact, President Packer has taught us that we are living in enemy territory.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Going on all around us is a great war between good and evil that began in the pre-mortal realm and continues today on earth. The university and the people who work and study here are under attack. Because this university prepares you to be disciples of Christ who build up the kingdom of God and establish Zion, the adversary gives special focus to this place. The Honor Code is one of the most important protections we have from the forces of evil.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your commitment to keep the commandments of the Lord can be a great protection to you. In a world full of temptation and evil, being honest, living the Word of Wisdom, being chaste and virtuous, and respecting others requires faith in Christ, rock-solid obedience, and listening to the whisperings of the Spirit. If you make and keep that commitment, it will become a central part of who you are and who you are becoming and the Lord will protect you.&nbsp;<br /><br />You have seen and will see many attempts to disguise the pain and spiritual destruction of unrighteousness with temporary excitement and pleasure. Satan and those who follow him will try to entice you into sin and darkness with their lies. Do not be fooled. Listen to the Spirit. If you keep the commandments, the Spirit will warn you when you are in danger. When that warning comes, your commitment to live the Honor Code will help you do what is right. In the critical moment of decision, you will feel the guidance of the Spirit. You will turn to the Lord, and He will protect you against the "wiles of the devil."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now consider the blessing of preparation. The Lord sees the end from the beginning. He always knows where we are headed, and He always prepares us for what is coming. At BYU-Idaho living the Honor Code is a growth experience that prepares you to become a disciple-leader: a true follower of Jesus Christ and a leader in your family, in the Church, and in the community in which you live and work.&nbsp;<br /><br />You are making decisions now that will determine how you will live your life, what your standards are going to be, where you will turn for guidance and direction, and whom you will serve. The Honor Code is there to help guide you into a life of obedience, service, and commitment to the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you faithfully live the Honor Code, you will learn to be obedient in all things, large or small, that come from the Lord. You will see clearly how your willingness to be obedient and unselfish brings blessings to your brothers and sisters, and to yourself. You will learn to keep your commitments as a matter of personal honor and integrity.&nbsp;<br /><br />Great blessings of growth and preparation will flow from your willing obedience to the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code. You will begin to feel an increase in the Savior's approval, His love, and His trust. He will bless you with increased faith in Him and love for Him and a greater desire to do what He wants you to do. You will have the Spirit with you, and your personal spiritual strength will grow. Your understanding of what it means to serve the Lord will deepen, and your capacity to serve will increase. You will be prepared to make sacred covenants in the temple, and you will be prepared to keep them.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to share with you a passage from a letter I received from a BYU-Idaho student just a few weeks ago. Please note how obedience has brought blessings of protection and preparation in this student's life:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have just completed my first semester here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I will be honest; I didn't think for a second that I would have a great experience... Now that I am here in Rexburg, there is no place else I'd rather go than BYU-I.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have come to love the Honor Code and the spirit it brings to this campus. I am so very grateful for the standards that are consistently upheld here at BYU-I. Not a day has gone by that I don't feel the [S]pirit here. I thought I would be bothered by all of the little things, like not being able to go to class in shorts or sweats. As the semester rolled on, I noticed that all the things that I thought would make this university hard for me to attend have actually become the reasons why I love it. Following the Honor Code has strengthened my testimony and has been an instrument of missionary work in my life.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><strong>Following the Savior: Living the Letter and the Spirit of the Honor Code</strong><br />This kind of faithful obedience follows the great example handed down to us by Adam and Eve. After they left the Garden, Adam and Eve were faithful and obedient to the commandments God gave them even though they did not fully understand their purposes. For example, when an angel appeared to Adam and asked, "Why dost thou offer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">sacrifices</a>&nbsp;unto the Lord?" Adam said, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Adam and Eve were blessed for their obedience, but the angel opened up to them a deeper understanding of the law of sacrifice and its connection to the Atonement of the Son of God:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">similitude</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">sacrifice</a>&nbsp;of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">grace</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">truth</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">name</a>&nbsp;of the Son, and thou shalt&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">repent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng" target="_self">call</a>&nbsp;upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Adam and Eve had kept the letter of the law of sacrifice before, but now they could obey the spirit of the law. They could act in the name of Christ to offer a similitude of His atoning sacrifice, and they could receive the blessings of His Atonement by repenting and praying to God in the name of His Son.&nbsp;<br /><br />Like Adam and Eve, you will be greatly blessed for obeying the letter of the Honor Code standards. As you faithfully obey the standards and seek greater understanding, you will discover that the spirit of the Honor Code infuses the standards with the principles of the gospel and the spiritual power of Jesus Christ. This means that when you live both the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code, you follow the Savior and He blesses you with protection and preparation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters please remember this principle: you can live the letter of the Honor Code if you follow the rules, but you can only live the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code if you follow the Savior.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to illustrate this principle by looking at three Honor Code standards and their deep connection to gospel principles and to the Savior. I hope you will see in these examples how to find your own deeper understanding of the commandments and standards in the Honor Code. I invite you to gain that understanding, more fully live both the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code, and enjoy the marvelous blessings of divine protection and preparation.&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Standard #1: Shorts and Flip Flops</em><br />The most frequent question I get about the Honor Code at BYU-Idaho is our standard on shorts and flip-flops. We ask you not to wear shorts or capris on campus, including when you are walking to and from the Hart Building or the fields to work out. The same thing is true of flip-flops. They may be appropriate in other places, but not on campus.&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this standard is to help you qualify for extra spiritual help in developing a reverence for sacred things.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The learning and teaching that take place on this dedicated campus are sacred experiences. When you live this standard, you make a small sacrifice that shows the Lord your additional respect for what happens in this special and set-apart place. This is a small thing, but the Lord has taught us that "out of small things proceedeth that which is great."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Your obedience in this small thing demonstrates your desire for increased spiritual blessings of sensitivity to and reverence for sacred places and sacred things. I invite you to live this standard in that spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is a promise: If you really live the spirit of this standard, the Lord will bless you to feel the importance of sacred things. He will help you cultivate an attitude of reverence in everything you wear and everything you do in sacred places and on sacred occasions. There will grow in your heart respect, reverence, and love for Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. You will be blessed with an increased desire to hold sacred that which They have hallowed and sanctified. These gifts of reverence and love will prepare you to stand in holy places with love for the Father and the Son all through your life.&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Standard #2: Apartment Visits</em><br />The second standard focuses on single men and women visiting in each other's apartments. I hope it is clear to you that we encourage such visits. We want you to spend time together. However, there are guidelines at BYU-Idaho that we ask you to follow, including approved hours and no one of the opposite sex in a bedroom at any time.&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of the standard is to protect you from sin and help you develop the discipline, unselfishness, self-control, and spiritual strength so important to a celestial marriage.&nbsp;<br /><br />In His mortal ministry, the Savior powerfully affirmed the law of chastity and raised the bar of a chaste and virtuous life to our thoughts, emotions, desires, and to all our behavior, especially behavior that might lead to adultery. Listen to His words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, it is written... that thou shalt not commit adultery;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the Savior makes it very clear that adultery is behavior far inside Lucifer's territory.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The visiting standards are guideposts that mark out the zone of "righteous sociality"<sup>15</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_08_Clark.htm#_edn15" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;far inside the Lord's territory and far from the zone of moral danger. We want you to avoid sexual sins that cause so much spiritual and emotional damage, but we also want you to be prepared for a wonderful marriage and a happy family life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The sacred covenants you make with an eternal companion in the House of the Lord are commitments to "cleave unto [one another] and none else."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;If will you live the law of chastity in your marriage, you will keep that commitment; and the deep, abiding love of a celestial union will grow and develop. You will keep lustful images or romantic thoughts of someone else out of your heart. And no attachments or involvements of any kind will ever take precedence over your commitment to your eternal companion. Living a chaste and virtuous life before and after you marry will help you develop the devotion, unselfishness, deep love, and spiritual strength of a celestial marriage. I invite you to live the visiting standard in that spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the promise: If you live the spirit of this standard, you will willingly live far within the Lord's territory. The Lord will protect you from sin. He will bless you with His love and an increased desire to have a celestial marriage and an eternal family. He will prepare you to live a chaste and virtuous life, to keep your temple covenants, to be sealed to an eternal companion and to your children by the Holy Spirit of Promise, and to forge an eternal union and an eternal family through the mercy and grace of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Standard #3: Encourage Others in Their Commitment to Live the Honor Code</em><br />One of the most important elements of the Honor Code is expressed in the third standard: encourage others in their commitment to live the standards. "Encourage" means to inspire, to invite with energy, to help activate or bring to life.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;This standard is a call to reach out to a friend or a roommate who may be discouraged or confused about the Honor Code or may be having trouble keeping his or her commitments.&nbsp;<br /><br />The purposes of this standard are to help you learn to love your neighbor, to save souls, and to protect and strengthen the Spirit on this campus. Those to whom you reach out will have to choose: will they "come to themselves" and turn to Christ, or will they "become for themselves" and turn away? As Jesus taught in Matthew, chapter 18, verses 15-17: "If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother [or sister]. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The standard to encourage others is a standard of action, communication, and connection with others. It is a standard for teaching, testifying, expressing love and concern, and inviting others to turn to Christ. I invite you to live the standard in that spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the promise: If you are true to your covenants and act with faith in Christ to help your roommates and your friends, you will learn how to love your neighbor and build the kingdom of God. The gospel of Jesus Christ will be deep in your hearts; and you will help, lift, and strengthen others wherever you go. You will do it in your families with your own children. You will reach out to people who are less active, to the lost, and to the struggling. And the redeeming and strengthening power of Jesus Christ will flow into their lives and into your life and the lives of your children forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will conclude with a true story that happened not long ago. The story begins with a BYU-Idaho student (I will call Jane) inviting her boyfriend into her bedroom. This happened more than once. Her roommates knew what Jane was doing, but she told them, "We just need a place to talk."&nbsp;<br /><br />Most of the roommates ignored what Jane was doing, but one of them, Mary, talked to Jane. Jane was upset with Mary and told her it was none of her business. Mary did not let it go. She followed Matthew, chapter 18, verses 15-17, and eventually persuaded Jane to go with her to the Student Honor Office.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jane went, but she was really upset with Mary. Jane met with a Student Honor administrator. He could tell that Jane was very angry with Mary for bringing her in, and so he asked Jane a really interesting question: "Which of your roommates do you think loves you the most--the ones who turned away or Mary who brought you here?" Jane dropped her head and began to cry. She said in her tears, "Mary is the one who loves me the most."&nbsp;<br /><br />That moment of tears and recognition was for Jane the beginning of "coming to herself" and turning to Christ. Many years from now when Jane is a wife and mother she will look back on the love of her roommate with overwhelming gratitude. She will think of her temple marriage, of her husband and her children, of her deep and abiding testimony of the gospel; and she will thank Heavenly Father for His plan of salvation, for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and for a roommate who reached out to her in a moment of great need.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Testimony</strong><br />There are many stories like this. They are your stories--stories that teach of the deep connection between your obedience to the Honor Code and the saving doctrine and redeeming love of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />You are beloved of the Lord. He knows you perfectly. He loves you. He has brought you to BYU-Idaho, and He expects great things of you. I pray that you will be obedient to Him so that in moments of decision, in times of temptation, challenge, or discouragement, you will "come to yourselves" and turn to Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. I testify of Him. I know He stands ready with open arms to forgive, to cleanse from sin, and to lift and strengthen all who come to Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the promise: if you follow the Savior and act with faith in Him to live the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code, He will protect you and prepare you to be His true disciples and receive His choicest blessings, now and forever. I know His promises are true. I know His love never fails. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former President, NY NY North Mission</p>
<p>Bio not available&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I have pondered and prayed as to what I might say that would be helpful, my thoughts have continued to return to the account of Alma the younger's repentance experience as recorded in Mosiah chapter 27 and again in Alma 36. I pray that the Spirit of the Holy Ghost will be with us today and that we will allow Him to communicate with us and teach us what He would have us learn, whether it is through my words or His gentle promptings and thoughts given to each of us individually.<br /><br />&nbsp;As you will recall, Alma was living a life that was contrary to the desires of his father and hurtful to the Church. He was described as a wicked and idolatrous man, one who was going about trying to destroy the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />You remember what happened. An angel of the Lord came unto Alma and the sons of Mosiah. &nbsp;The angel asked them why they were doing what they were doing. The angel explained that the Church they were trying to destroy was the Lord's Church and that nothing was going to overthrow it save it be the transgression of the people. The angel instructed Alma to stop--to seek no more to destroy the Church. And if he didn't, he would be destroyed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma was stunned by the angelic visitation. The scriptures describe Alma as being so astonished by the visitation that he became dumb and couldn't function for three days. During that three-day period, a repentance experience is recorded which is unparalleled in the scriptures. The experience resulted in Alma leaving his past behind him, never again to persecute the Church. Instead, he proceeded to go about building up the Church, teaching, baptizing, and testifying of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. His level of commitment and conversion was so great that he continued on this path--without wavering--for the remainder of his days.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have often asked myself, what was it about this experience--and this man--that brought about this unwavering, permanent level of commitment and conversion that lasted forever?&nbsp;<br /><br />Before exploring some of Alma's words describing his experience, I would like to share with you a personal experience as an analogy. I am not suggesting that this example is meant to explain Alma's experience, but perhaps this analogy might give us something to ponder as we face the challenges in our own lives when we find ourselves not on the right path.&nbsp;<br /><br />As President Clark mentioned, I have a passion for flying. Over the years, I have earned a number of ratings, one of which is an instrument flight rating. When completed, this rating authorizes a pilot<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to fly in instrument conditions--in other words to fly in the clouds or fog or in conditions in which the pilot does not have visual reference with the ground.&nbsp;<br /><br />In order to receive this rating, a pilot must pass a flight examination. Part of the exam requires the student to actually pilot an airplane under simulated instrument conditions while accompanied by a flight examiner.&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember the day of my flight examination well. After successfully completing the oral part of the exam, I felt pretty confident. I had been able to articulate the pertinent flight rules and was able to explain how flight instruments work. Then came the flight test. After taxiing to the runway, I successfully executed a take off and climb relying only upon the flight instruments. When we reached the assigned altitude, my examiner, a wonderful man by the name of Bob Clayton, directed me to demonstrate a few maneuvers relying only on the flight instruments. After completing the maneuvers, he then asked me to demonstrate what is referred to as an NDB holding pattern.&nbsp;<br /><br />This maneuver requires the pilot to fly to an imaginary point in the sky, as indicated by flight instruments, and then depart from that point in an assigned direction. Then, in simple terms, the pilot flies elongated oval patterns, each revolution, crossing over the imaginary point, or, what pilots refer to as the initial fix.&nbsp;<br /><br />I flew directly to the imaginary point or initial fix. I banked the airplane until I had intercepted the assigned course for the holding pattern. I was confident that I had headed in the correct direction. But as I approached the point where I should start turning and create the oval pattern, the needles on the flight instrument seemed to go the wrong direction. The more I turned, the further from the correct course the needles seemed to indicate.&nbsp;<br /><br />I became confused. I started turning the other direction hoping that by chance I might find my way again<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This time, the needles didn't even seem to move at all. I became more confused and became nervous. The stress of the situation increased. All this time, I was also trying to maintain control of the airplane and maintain a constant airspeed and altitude.&nbsp;<br /><br />Needless to say, the situation continued to deteriorate. For a moment, I thought maybe if I adjusted the flight instrument, possibly the needles would line up and I would magically get back on course. That idea failed immediately. I knew I was hopelessly off course, and I knew that my examiner also knew I was off course. After making a couple more futile attempts to get back on course, I realized I had no idea where I was. I made a decision. I turned to my examiner and said: "I have lost my way; I would like to return to the initial fix and try the maneuver again." He responded by saying that he thought this would be a splendid idea and that I should probably do it very quickly since I had strayed way off course. I returned again to the initial fix and this time was able to properly demonstrate the holding pattern.&nbsp;<br /><br />The flight test continued and my examiner asked that I demonstrate other maneuvers. But, as I did, it seemed that I wasn't doing a very good job. My altitude and airspeed began to fluctuate; my maneuvers seemed choppy, not smooth. &nbsp;My concentration wandered from the maneuvers I was asked to demonstrate to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the memory of the terrible mistake I had made. Even though I had corrected the mistake and successfully shown that I knew how to do it, I just couldn't seem to let go of how badly I had erred. My confidence began to fail me. I was embarrassed. I started questioning my every move. I was not hearing all of the instructions that my examiner was giving me. Doubt about the whole exam entered in and soon, I had convinced myself that I had probably<strong>&nbsp;</strong>failed the exam.&nbsp;<br /><br />This great flight examiner sensed my loss of confidence and my discouragement. To this day, I will never forget what he did. Bob Clayton said, "Richard, let me take the controls for a minute." He then gave me some great advice. He told me that I had made a pretty monumental error when I began the maneuver. But even in the midst of the mistake, I had kept the airplane straight and level, I had not lost control<em>.&nbsp;</em>He told me that when I had realized my mistake, I admitted it to myself and to him. And then, I had made a great decision and chose to&nbsp;<em>return to the place where I knew I could get back on course.</em>&nbsp;Then he said, "Take a deep breath. Forget about your mistake. Go forward with this test and show me what I know you can do." My confidence began to return. We continued on with the test.&nbsp;<br /><br />Upon completion of the flight test, we landed and returned to the room where we had conducted the oral part of the exam. As we reviewed the flight portion of the test, Bob Clayton helped me understand what I had done wrong in the holding pattern maneuver. I was surprised at how such a minor error had gotten me so disoriented and so far off course. He then explained something that has stayed with me all these years. He told me that he can usually tell within the first ten minutes if a pilot can handle an airplane in simulated instrument conditions. But, he said, what is really telling about a pilot's ability is what he does when things go wrong. He informed me that I had passed the test because of two reasons:&nbsp;<br /><br />1. First, when you discovered you had made a mistake, you didn't spend a lot of time continuing on the wrong path, hunting and hoping to accidentally find the true course. You didn't try to fool yourself and, more importantly, you didn't try to fool me that your incorrect course would somehow lead to the correct destination. Instead, you chose to be honest with yourself. You admitted that you were off course and you then made a great decision--to return to the point where you knew you could begin to get back on course.&nbsp;<br /><br />2. Second--and equally important--when discouragement, frustration, and doubt entered in as a result of your mistake, you were able to heed my counsel and let it go. You didn't allow the memory of your mistake to spoil the rest of your exam. And then he said there is something I want you to remember: disastrous airplane accidents often begin with a single simple mistake. Yet the actual cause of the accident is usually due to a pilot's loss of control of the airplane. Too often a pilot becomes so overwhelmed and preoccupied with a mistake, that even though it may be corrected, he fails to pay attention to flying the airplane and then loses control which in turn results in disastrous consequences.&nbsp;<br /><br />For twenty years, this experience and the counsel that Bob Clayton gave me have helped me become a better pilot and probably have saved my life during some difficult flying conditions.&nbsp;<br /><br />In that context, I return and focus on a few of the words Alma used in describing his experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />We marvel at the tremendous change that Alma experienced. Many attribute it to being visited by an angel, but certainly the prayers of righteous parents helped. However, scriptures contain a number of accounts of wayward children raised by good parents who prayed for their children constantly, some were even visited by angels. Yet, they never experienced that "mighty change of heart" that Alma experienced. &nbsp;What was it that brought about this tremendous conversion?&nbsp;<br /><br />After describing to his son Helaman how astonished he had been by the angelic visit, he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; . . . for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins. Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was t ormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The role of the angel in this repentance process, although a jolting influence, seems secondary to something much greater.</p>
<p>Last week, in his devotional address, President Clark referred to the parable of the Prodigal Son, and particularly, the scripture that describes that difficult moment when the prodigal son "came unto himself" and faced the reality of his circumstances<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;So it was for Alma. In the midst of this startling experience of seeing an angel, he chose to face his circumstances. He was honest with himself and with God. He acknowledged his sins. He faced the painful reality of a life which had gone badly off course. As painful as this realization was, he did not kid himself, he did not whitewash his actions nor did he minimize his mistakes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was during this very candid and painful time that Alma made a decision. Rather than to continue to 'follow strange roads', using Nephi's terminology; and fooling himself to think that through minor adjustments or zigzagging on his current path, he might miraculously get back on the right path; instead, Alma decided that he must abandon his present course and return to a place that he knew would get him on the right path again.&nbsp;<br /><br />He explained to his son that as he was being "racked with torment" and "harrowed up by the memory of my many sins" he:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In the midst of his pains, Alma chose to return to the eternal truth that had rung true in his heart many years previous--his knowledge and testimony that there would come a Savior to the world and that through His Atonement, He would redeem men from their sins and forgive them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Alma immediately and thoroughly jettisoned his old ways. He repented. He was forgiven--all in the matter of a few days. He described to his son that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. . . there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains . . . on the other hand there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>But, that is not the end of this remarkable account. I would suggest to you that it was really just the beginning. From this pivotal point in his life, he explained to his son that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Alma did not hesitate. When he said, "I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more," he meant no more--never again. He did not allow the memory or regret of his sins to stand in his way. For almost thirty years--the remainder of Alma's life--he went forward with faith, hope, and confidence not only in the Lord but also in himself. Gone were any barriers that might block the direction that he knew his life must take. And Alma refused to allow the barriers to ever rise again.</p>
<p>As we face the reality of our life, choosing to be honest with ourselves and with God; repenting of our sins, forsaking them forever, and then tasting of the sweet forgiveness that comes through the Atonement of our Savior; all the barriers which might block our path which our Father in Heaven has directed us to follow are also gone. The Savior promised:</p>
<p>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Intellectually, we understand this doctrine of which I have spoken. In the daily living of our lives, sometimes it seems difficult to implement.&nbsp;<br /><br />During the past three years more than a few times, I have spent long hours talking to missionaries--dedicated, worthy, repentant missionaries--who continued to be haunted by past mistakes. These are missionaries who had felt the forgiveness of their sins. But, when life became difficult, and it always does at some point on a mission, they allowed doubt and guilt and embarrassment of the past to once again enter in. &nbsp;These feelings then blocked the progress of their missions and stole from them, and the Lord, valuable time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share a story and a comment from Elder M. Russell Ballard.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Ballard knew a young man who had been guilty of past moral transgressions. At times in his life, he had repented and had been victorious over temptations. Other times he had not. He had worked with a number of priesthood leaders over the years and seemed to have conquered his past temptations. This was a young man who had served in the Church. He had married in the temple and had a wife that loved him and was devoted to him and their family. Intellectually, he had a great understanding of the gospel and of Heavenly Father's plan. &nbsp;Yet he continued to struggle.&nbsp;<br /><br />In a conversation the young man had with Elder Ballard, the young man said to him, "I knew that I was a child of God," he said. "But, to be honest that thought didn't give me much comfort. I figured that I was one of Heavenly Father's bad children and that all I had succeeded in proving during this life is that I wasn't one of the 'noble and great ones' Abraham saw."&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Ballard continued, "This young man served in significant Church callings. People praised him for his effectiveness as a priesthood leader, but he was unmoved by their praise. He assumed that he had simply fooled them, that if people knew the truth about him and who he really was, they would know he wasn't what he appeared to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />"But it was my friend who had been fooled. Satan had convinced him that he was fighting a losing battle, so when temptations came his way, it was easy to give in. He was after all, one of God's bad children; therefore, it was understandable if he occasionally did bad things."&nbsp;<br /><br />There is no truth in Satan's deception. We are good. All men and women born into this world come here good. We are good because we are Spirit children of our Father in Heaven. We kept our first estate. At some point in the premortal world we stood and said, "I will." I will accept my Father in Heaven's plan and come to earth in order that He might "prove us herewith" as to our devotion, our love, and our willingness to obey Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />The young man who Elder Ballard described in the story had been deceived. Even though he had forsaken his sins, he yielded to Satan's deception that he was bad and would probably always be bad. As a consequence, he refused to let go of the pain; the pain of past sins; pain that the Savior Himself desires to lift from us. The refusal to let go of the pain not only blocked his path forward, but started again a cycle of returning to his past ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma on the other hand chose to let go of the pain and "be harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more." He resisted the temptation to look back and linger on the doubt and fear and regret that he had once faced and had conquered. Yes, he let the pain go; refusing to believe he was inherently bad.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of you, like Alma, has something great and wonderful to contribute to others. But, just like Alma, we won't be able to accomplish this work if we are mired down, wallowing in doubt, guilt and regret for things of the past which the Lord has forgiven and which He no longer remembers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, may we have the faith and courage to let go of the pain of past sins of which we have repented. I have a testimony that the Lord has lifted them from us and remembers them no more.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord needs you. It just might be that your contribution, and the love you extend to another will be the Heaven sent influence which will "lift [another's] hands which hang down and strengthen their feeble knees"<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;unto realizing once again that they are children of Heavenly parents and that they are good.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presidency of the Seventy</p>
<p>Tad R. Callister was serving in the Presidency of the Seventy and as a member of the Second Quorum&nbsp;of the Seventy when he was called as Sunday School general president. He has served in a number of Church callings including full-time missionary in the Eastern Atlantic States Mission, bishop, stake president, regional representative, mission president, and Area Seventy.<br /><br />Brother Callister received a bachelor of science degree in accounting from Brigham Young University, a Juris Doctorate degree from the University of California-Los Angeles, and a master's degree in tax law from New York University Law School. He spent most of his professional career practicing tax law. He and his wife Kathryn Louise Saporiti are the parents of six children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today I would like to discuss with you a delicate subject--the Lord's standard of morality. I pray that I can be clear and concise and unambiguous in presenting that standard, yet still be discreet and tasteful in my comments.<br /><br />Some years ago my father, who was an attorney, was trying a lawsuit. For his authority, he cited only one case--an old California Supreme Court case, issued many years before.&nbsp; His opponent cited a number of lower court decisions of much more recent vintage. The judge finally said to my father: "Mr. Callister, don't you have a more recent case than this?" My father looked at the judge and replied: "Your honor, may I remind you that when the Supreme Court speaks on a matter, it only needs to speak once." The judge nodded with approval. He was reminded that the Supreme Court trumps all lower court decisions, however numerous or recent they may be. So it is with God our Father--He only needs to speak once on the issue of morality, and that one declaration trumps all the opinions of the "lower courts," whether uttered by psychologists, counselors, politicians, friends, parents or would-be moralists of the day.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is almost unbelievable to think that God gave to man that power which was most prized and sacred to Him--the power to create other men. Because God gave to us this power, He, and He alone, has the right to prescribe how it should be used. Contrary to much public sentiment, there is nothing negative or restraining about God's moral standards. Rather, they are positive and uplifting and liberating. They build relationships of trust, they enhance self-esteem, they foster a clear conscience, and they invite the Spirit of the Lord to bless our individual and married lives. They are the proven standard for happy marriages and stable communities.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some years ago one of my high school friends visited me. We talked over old times. Unfortunately he had chosen a life of moral transgression. At one point he broke out in tears and exclaimed, almost like a broken record, "I want to be clean, I want to be clean, I want to be clean." To his credit he eventually changed his life to conform to the moral standards he knew to be correct. Like my friend, I believe there is an innate desire in every man and woman to be morally clean--oh, there may be some moments of rationalization, or expressions that yield to the peer pressure and fashions of the day, but in the quiet, reflective moments of life, when one ponders who he really is and what he really wants to become, there emerges a God-given desire to be clean, to be holy, to be right with that very being who created him and planted within him the creative powers.&nbsp;<br /><br />What then is the Lord's standard for use of this creative and sacred power--His standard of morality? In truth, the Lord's standard of morality is not so much a list of do's and don'ts, but a principle, which I believe can be expressed as follows: The creative power is to be exercised in the marriage relationship for two key reasons: (i) to bind and strengthen ties between spouses and (ii) to bring souls into this world. These uses have the blessing and endorsement of the Lord. On the other hand the creative powers are not to be exercised outside the husband/wife relationship. Accordingly, any conscious thoughts or voluntary actions that stimulate or result in the expression of those creative powers outside the marriage relationship are disapproved by the Lord. That I believe is the principle.<br /><br />More specifically, however, I now cite some of the Lord's standards of morality so as to minimize any misunderstanding or ambiguity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>First Standard: Fornication and Adultery</strong><strong><br /></strong>The Lord forbids fornication and adultery in spite of how the world feels on these subjects. These acts constitute the ultimate use of the creative powers with someone of the opposite sex with whom you are not legally married. It is fornication if neither party is married; it is adultery if either or both parties are married. The Apostle Paul said: "<em>For this is the will of God</em>...that ye should abstain from fornication."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Paul also said: "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God...<em>neither fornicators</em>,&nbsp;<em>nor adulterers.</em>"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes people do not realize the seriousness of these transgressions, or in some cases, rationalize it away. Corianton did not seem to realize the seriousness of what he had done when he sinned with the harlot Isabel. Alma, his father, put it in perspective: "Know ye not, my son that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Next in gravity to the sin of murder is that of fornication and adultery. Joseph spoke of these great evils. When he was tempted by Potipher's wife, who said "Lie with me." he replied, "How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"<sup>4</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Second Standard: Inappropriate Touching</strong><br />Inappropriate touching is the smaller sister of fornication and adultery. It is designed to arouse the &nbsp;creative powers. Accordingly, it is contrary to God's moral standard in the premarital setting, to touch the private or sacred parts of another's body, whether or not such person is clothed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Third Standard: Self</strong>-<strong>abuse</strong><br />The Lord condemns self-abuse. Self-abuse is the act of stimulating one's own creative powers. President Boyd K. Packer, spoke on this subject as follows: "Do not be guilty of tampering or playing with the sacred power of creation. It is not pleasing to the Lord nor is it pleasing to you. It does not make you feel worthy or clean."5&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fourth Standard: Same-gender Relationships<br /></strong>This is engaging in intimate physical relationships with someone of the same gender. There are some who would have you believe that the Church's stand against same-gender relationships is a temporary policy, not an eternal doctrine. Such a belief as this would be at odds with the scriptures, with the words of modern prophets and with the Plan of Salvation, all of which teach the necessity of eternal marriage between a husband and a wife as a condition to exaltation. A same-gender relationship is inconsistent with God's eternal pattern that husbands and wives not only have children in mortality, but eternal increase in their exalted condition.&nbsp;<br /><br />Having said that we recognize that everyone is a son and daughter of God and deserves to be treated as such. We all struggle with imperfections, some not of our choosing, but we also believe in an infinite Atonement that has the capacity in this life or the life to come to endow us with every power necessary to convert our weaknesses and imperfections to strengths. The Lord promised us: "for if they humble themselves before me and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If someone has same-gender tendencies then it is his or her duty to (i) abstain from immoral relationships just as a single heterosexual must do, and (ii) do all within his power to avail himself of the refining, perfecting powers of the Atonement. In the interim, however, those who do have same-gender tendencies but do not act on them are worthy to hold Church positions and receive a temple recommend.&nbsp;<br /><br />For a few moments now may I share with you some danger signals that precede some of the sins of which I have spoken. In some regards Satan is like an octopus with all of its tentacles trying to capture us. If one tentacle does not work he will try another and another until he finds one that will take hold--one weakness that will yield to his grasp. Following are some of the tentacles of the evil one, each designed to cause us to break God's standard of morality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>First Tentacle: Pornography</strong><br />God is desirous that none of His children watch any movie, TV show, web site, or view any magazine that is pornographic in any way. Pornography is any picture or narrative that feeds the carnal man within. It is&nbsp;<em>repulsive</em>&nbsp;to the spirit of the Lord.The story is told of the lone Indian brave who ascended a high mountain top. The weather was bitter cold at the summit. He looked around and saw a rattlesnake. He withdrew a safe distance.&nbsp;<br /><br />The rattlesnake then spoke to him in pleading tones, "Please take me to the valley below where the weather is warmer and I can survive, otherwise I will die."&nbsp;<br /><br />The brave replied, "But you will bite me."&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;"No," came the reply from the snake, "I will treat you differently, you will be special. I promise I will not bite you if you deliver me to safety below."&nbsp;<br /><br />The believing brave picked up the snake, held him next to the warmeth of his body and carried him to the valley below. Just as he released him, the snake struck and bit the young brave. He cried out, "But you promised."&nbsp;<br /><br />To which the snake replied, "You knew what I was when you picked me up."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />No one can claim to be fooled by the effects of pornography when he "picks it up"--believing there is any such thing as an innocent glance. It is a poisonous, venomous, unforgiving snake that will strike the moment one takes his first look and continue to strike with a full portion of venom at each look thereafter. Pornography is a sure way to repel the Spirit of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are afflicted with this malady then you need to do all within your power to overcome it. It may require confession, intense prayer, fasting, more immersion in the scriptures, replacing idle time with constructive time, putting boundaries on computer usage, counseling, and the like, but you can overcome it. Part of it will require old fashioned willpower. There is not a pill or counseling technique to solve every addiction--at some point willpower is an indispensible ingredient. Sometimes we have to answer hard questions: What means more to me pornography or my temple recommend? Pornography or my relationship with my current or future spouse? Pornography or the right to enjoy the spirit?&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has promised, "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; In otherwords, no one can claim as an excuse at the judgement bar that he was tempted above his ability to resist. Everyone has sufficient moral agency to overcome any weaknesses, including pornography.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Second Tentacle: Immodest Dress</strong><br />Our dress not only affects our thoughts and actions, but also the thoughts and actions of others. Accordingly, Paul the apostle warned, "Women adorn...[yourselves] in modest apparel"&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>. The dress of a woman has a powerful impact upon the minds and passions of men. If it is too low or too high or too tight it may prompt improper thoughts, even in the mind of a young man who is striving to be pure. Elder Matthew Cowley once commented on the long flowing dresses of the Native American Indians--as I recall he said, "How beautiful--how modest--they leave everything to the imagination."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Men and women can dress sharp, they can be fashionable, yet they can also be modest. Women particularly can leave a lot to the imagination and in the process contribute to their own self-respect and to the moral purity of men. In the end, most women get the type of man they dress for.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Third Tentacle: Unclean Thoughts</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />It has been said: "You can watch the birds fly by, just don't let them build a nest on your head." There is nothing wrong with noticing the pretty young lady or handsome young man as they walk by--that is normal--but if those thoughts turn to lust then the nest is being built. One cannot avoid seeing every improper billboard or every immodestly dressed person, but we can drive out the improper thought once it arises. The sin is not in involuntarily seeing something improper; the sin is in entertaining the thought once it comes. The scriptures tell us: "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In essence, our thoughts become the seeds of our actions.We do have the power within us to take control of our lives and our thoughts. Good and evil thoughts cannot simultaneously coexist in our minds anymore than light and dark can coexist at the same time and in the same place. At some point one must decide which will be his invited guest. If we so desire, we can drive out every evil thought and immediately replace it with an uplifting song or poem or scripture. Just as darkness flees at the presence of light, so evil flees at the presence of good.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has not only invited us, but commanded us to have clean thoughts, and has given a magnificent promise to those who do so, "let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly;&nbsp;<em>then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God"<sup>&nbsp;</sup></em><sup>12</sup>. In other words, if our thoughts are pure we can have a clear conscience and approach God with confidence that He will answer the righteous desires of our hearts.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fourth Tentacle: Secluded Places and Tempting Friends</strong><br />There are certain times and places, no matter how strong we are, when we have less resistance than others. Such times and places may be in secluded locations, late at night, or in the company of certain friends or acquaintences. Some of the best of men and women in the worst of circumstances have fallen. It happened to the Prophet David as he watched Bathsheba, at first from a seemingly safe distance, and then the fall came. None of us should think we are too powerful, too immune to succumb. Secluded locations, late night activities, and morally loose friends have incredible magnetic fields to draw us into Satan's clutches. They are the devil's playground--the place where he has homefield advantage. When Joseph of Egypt found himself in such circumstances the scriptures record, "He got him out."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Unfortunately, we may occassionally have friends or acquaintances who are constantly tempting--pushing us to the edge of our moral resolve--and sometimes beyond it. If we have such a friend or acquaintance then we need to help him or her adopt the Lord's standard of morality, and if unwilling to do so, we may need to make the hard, but correct choice to seek company with someone else who will encourage us to be morally clean, rather than test our moral resolve at every occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fifth Tentacle: Rationalization</strong><br />There are two oft repeated rationalizations to support one's moral transgressions. The first is, "I loved her." Satan is the great counterfeiter. He tries to palm off lust as love. There is a simple test to detect the difference. Love is motivated by self-control, obedience to God's moral laws, respect for others and unselfishness. On the other hand, lust is motivated by lack of discipline, disobedience, and self-gratification. If one engages in premarital relations, what are the prompting factors--is it self-gratification? Is it disobedience to God's standard of morality? Is it a lack of discipline? If the answers are yes, then you may know it is lust, not love that is the motivating force.&nbsp;<br /><br />The second rationalization is that "no one will ever know." The Lord has dispelled that myth on multiple occasions. The Savior declared, "The rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow, for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops,&nbsp;<em>and their secret acts shall be revealed</em>."<sup>14</sup>This truth, as spoken by God, is in startling contrast to the banner I saw hanging in an airport of a city known for its licentiousness, which reads, "Whatever you do here stays here." There is no field so dark or corner so secluded that no one will ever know. God will know, and you will know if you violate His moral law.&nbsp;<br /><br />What if I want to be morally clean but have difficulty resisting the temptations that confront me? In otherwords, what can I do to build my moral resistance? While serving as a church leader I had a young man come to me who had difficulty keeping his thoughts clean. He said that unclean thoughts would often pop into his mind and then he would strive to drive them out. I asked him if he had a song he would sing or a scripture he would recall that helped him. He said he did and it helped, but some improper thoughts still came. I pondered for a moment and then an impression came.&nbsp;<br /><br />I said, "You like to play basketball don't you?"&nbsp;<br /><br />"Oh, yes!" came the reply, "I love basketball."&nbsp;<br /><br />"Well, suppose for a moment that at your next game the coach called all the players together just before the tip-off and said, 'Tonight, players, no one is to take a shot. We are going to save all our energy and play the best defensive game that anyone has ever played, but in the process no one will shoot.' What is the best your team could hope to do?"&nbsp;<br /><br />He looked somewhat puzzled and replied, "Break even, a zero to zero tie."&nbsp;<br /><br />"That's right," I replied, "and that's exactly what you are doing. You have been playing defense. When some evil thought comes you try to drive it out. That is good, but it is the lesser part of what you ought to be doing. You need to take the offense. For in truth, the best defense is a good offense."&nbsp;<br /><br />I then asked him if he prayed daily.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Not always," was the response.&nbsp;<br /><br />I asked about his daily scripture reading; it was limited. Did he attend all his church meetings regularly--"No," came the answer. His spiritual offense was sporadic at best.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan is a formidable opponent. He has had years of mortal experience tempting mankind. Wherever he goes he leaves a trail of carnage--children out of wedlock, abortions, unfaithful spouses, broken homes, guilty consciences, and the list goes on and on. He employs the scorched-earth policy with sinister perfection--there is no mercy, no survivors, and no happiness. He is our archenemy. You can never win playing Satan's rules.Following, however, are some promises and resources God has given us to help us take the offense against him, and in fact, conquer him.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>First</strong>--<em>repent.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>If we have made some moral mistakes in our life, then, fortunately, because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can repent. That is the first and foundational step to living a morally clean life for the future--to repent of past transgressions--to exchange a foundation of sand for a foundation of rock. Often that commences with confession.&nbsp;<br /><br />Repentance, however, is not just a matter of time, or forsaking a sin, or making a confession, all of which are important, but most of all it is an honest change of heart, a burning resolve to live a morally clean life, not because you have to, but because you want to.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Second</strong>--<em>pray with intensity</em>. We can take the offense against Satan by offering powerful, meaningful prayers, both morning and evening. I do not mean the casual prayer when we climb into bed, put our head on the pillow and pray that we will be the next Miss Idaho or football superstar. While there is nothing wrong with those things in and of themselves, I am speaking for a moment about the prayers pleading for answers that have eternal consequences. We can pray that the Lord will help us be morally clean; we can pray He will help us find a good spouse; we can pray that He will help us overcome our weaknesses and develop our talents. Our Father in Heaven loves us immensely and wants to respond to and answer those prayers that have eternal import in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe there are many good young people, who have their evening prayers but may neglect their morning prayers. For me personally, it is the most impactful prayer--it forges my attitude and goals and desires for the day. The evening prayer, while certainly important, is too late to reshape the day. Which of you, if you had lived in Book of Mormon times would have marched out to the heat of battle without a breastplate and shield and sword to protect you against the potentially mortal blows of the enemy, but how many of us march out each morning to the most dangerous of all battlefields, to face the enemy of all enemies--Satan--without his or her spiritual breastplate or shield or sword that come from the protective power of prayer. The Lord himself said, "Pray always...that you may conquer Satan."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Third</strong>--<em>be consistent scripture readers</em>. Years ago our daughter, who played the cello, participated in a cello recital. At the conclusion the teacher asked the parents if they had any questions. One parent responded by asking, "Does my child need to practice the cello every single day?" Of course we all knew what answer that parent wanted the teacher to give. To our surprise the teacher started out by responding, "No--your child does not need to practice the cello every day; she only needs to practice on the days she wants to eat."&nbsp;<br /><br />That is the counsel that I would give with regards to reading the scriptures. You do not need to read the scriptures every day; you only need to read them on the days you want to eat, and if you ate that day physically, then you eat that day spiritually by reading the scriptures. How many of us go to bed at night, put our head on the pillow and have never thought of feeding ourselves physically the entire day. Yet how many go to bed at night, put their head on the pillow, and never fed themselves spiritually during the day. Our spiritual body needs food and sustenance on a daily basis, just as our physical body does. You cannot take the offense against Satan by tip-toeing through the scriptures; you must immerse yourself in them, and as you do so an inner strength and resolve to be clean will emerge.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fourth</strong>--<em>fast with a purpose</em>. Ironically, fasting is a form of spiritual feasting. It is a divinely given means of strengthening our spirit and disciplining our passions. As we learn to say "no," to food, even when our body craves and cries out for it, so too we learn and gain the power to say no to other physical desires and passions of even greater magnitude.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fifth</strong>--<em>learn your identity and purpose<strong>.</strong></em>&nbsp;Once we truly understand our identity and purpose--that we are childern of God and that our goal in life is to become like Him--then the desire to be clean, to be holy, to be Christlike transcends our desire to do otherwise. Reading our patriarchal blessings frequently and attending the temple regularly can help us in that effort to understand our divine identity and destiny.&nbsp;<br /><br />What if I made a mistake and violated God's standard of morality--is there any hope for me? Of course there is. God made it clear that His standards cannot be violated without suffering the consequences, but because He is loving and compassionate beyond measure He gives us this glorious hope, "For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;&nbsp;<em>nevertheless, he that repents</em>&nbsp;and does the commandments of the Lord&nbsp;<em>shall be forgiven</em>."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For every honest soul who changes his heart, and forsakes his sins, God has promised, "though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What greater promise could we hope for than to know that if we repent we are white as the driven snow? Lest there be any misunderstanding, however, it is always better to remain clean than to sin and repent thereafter. Why is that? Because (i) certain adverse consequences of sin may remain even after repentance, such as disease or a child born out of wedlock, or damage to one's reputation, and (ii) our goal in life is not just to be clean, but also to be perfect, and the quest for perfection is accelerated when we are clean, but it is temporarily stymied when we are not.&nbsp;<br /><br />A Book of Mormon prophet taught, "Wickedness never was happiness."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;One cannot break God's moral laws with impunity and be happy, because God, who created us, placed within our souls a moral compass known as our conscience. Anytime we violate God's standard of morality that conscience goes to work--it gnaws at us, it triggers feelings of guilt and remorse and it acts as a divine witness testifying to the truth of God's standard of morality.&nbsp;<br /><br />We may try to ignore it, we may try to suppress it but there is no escape from it. God's standard of morality cannot be dismissed; it cannot be diluted or compromised; it can only be obeyed or disobeyed. One may fight it or embrace it. His choice will largely determine his happiness in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The blessings of living a clean and moral life are overwhelming. Such a life will bring self-confidence and self-esteem. It will result in a clear conscience. It will make us eligible for a spouse of like-purity and it will provide for the expression of the creative powers in the marriage relationship to be sweeter and more rewarding because we have reserved them for the time that has been endorsed by the Lord Himself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because the Lord loves us immensely and wants us to be happy He has announced his intentions for His children in these latter days, "For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;You are the ones to whom He is referring. May each of you be a part of that pure generation and embrace the Lord's standards of morality, I so plead, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bio not available</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've called my remarks today "Four Things I've Learned in Nursery and Sunbeams." These aren't lessons from when I was in Nursery. I'm a convert to the church and spent only a little more than 2 years in Primary. But in the past 3 years in 2 different wards, I've been called to the Nursery, then to Sunbeams, then again to the Nursery. Previous to this, I hadn't been called to the primary in 20 years--and that was just one summer when I was home from college. Obviously, I have something to learn from the young children of the church. I hope to share some of those lessons with you.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>1. Good to be Different. Good to be yourself.</strong><br />In nursery, little girls can sometimes get excited about their dresses. One day as I was playing with a couple of girls, one said, "I have a blue dress."&nbsp;<br /><br />The other girl looked down at here yellow dress, a little sad. So being diplomatic, I said, "Yes, you do have a blue dress. And look, she has a yellow dress."&nbsp;<br /><br />Even better, the girl with the blue dress said, "And I have polka-dots."&nbsp;<br /><br />And the girl with the yellow dress said "and I have flowers."&nbsp;<br /><br />I said, "And isn't that great!"&nbsp;<br /><br />They both beamed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Whether you have a blue dress with polka dots, or a yellow dress with flowers, or a red tie with stripes, or a blue tie with a diamond pattern, your uniqueness is good.&nbsp;<br /><br />Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, a scripture that should be familiar to many of you, says, "Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day." Notice it says with&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;heart and&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;might and&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;mind and&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;strength, not someone else's. That's what Heavenly Father needs:&nbsp;<em>you</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />As part of your Foundations English classes, many of you have read the essay by Thomas Plummer called "Diagnosing and Treating the Ophelia Syndrome." In this essay, Plummer quotes a friend of his: "If we both think the same way, one of us is unnecessary."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;You're all necessary because you all have distinct gifts.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your life may not look like everyone else's and this can be frightening. But Heavenly Father has a mission for you--one that you need to fulfill. I can't tell what that is. Nor can anyone else. Philippians 2:12 reminds us that you need to "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."&nbsp;<em>You</em>&nbsp;have to figure out what&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;need to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />That means you might have to do this at different times from other people. Ecclesiastes reminds us, "To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted . . . A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />There's a time for everything. But it can look scary when our timeline isn't the same as someone else's. Sometimes we have to wait.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Nursery, we understand the idea that different things happen at different times. First we do puzzles, then we play with the toys, and then we have the lesson. It's okay to wait. We wait for the snack, and we wait for singing time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me give you an example of how people might do the same things at different times. I have a student Phylicia who lives her life in fast forward--as fast her bishop would let her she was getting baptized and going on a mission. In fact, she listened to the missionaries, got baptized, went on a mission, met the love of her life, and got sealed in the temple in just four years. That's fast. In contrast, my mom listened to the missionaries for the first time when she first married my dad, before I was born. Then about twelve years later she, my sister, and I were baptized. Then she remarried to my stepdad. Then he got baptized. Then finally, nearly twenty years after she first heard the missionary discussions, they were sealed. Some of you might wish you were married tomorrow, or graduating tomorrow, or having babies, or getting your perfect job. But it might take you four years. Or twenty. What matters most is that you're living the gospel and trying to progress.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>2. Good to learn. It's exciting!</strong><br />The children in Nursery and Sunbeams&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;learning and they&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;books. At this age, we have lessons like "I Love the Scriptures" and "I Am Thankful for Water." When I taught the "I Love the Scriptures" lesson in Nursery, I passed out copies of the Book of Mormon so they could hold the scriptures. These little guys are two year olds. They can't even begin to read. But they&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;the scriptures. And I passed out copies without pictures! They didn't want to give them back.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I taught the Sunbeams the "I Am Thankful for Water" lesson, truthfully, I was a little stumped. How do you talk about water for fifty minutes? We usually try for object lessons, but with water--that would just be a big mess. So I brought a bunch of books with me--any book I could find with pictures of water in it. I figured looking at water pictures might last 2-3 minutes because that's usually how long their attention span is. I should have known better. We looked at pictures of rivers, lakes, and oceans, and waterfalls. We talked about the fish in the oceans, the trees beside the lakes, and the rocks in the waterfalls. We looked at books for more than fifteen minutes. For a three-year-old, that's like six hours. Three-year olds&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;books. And they want to look at them again and again. Now, I know that some of you&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;you have deadly allergies to books. You don't. That you might break out in hives if you go near the library. You won't. Like the Sunbeams and Nursery kids, you should&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;books. You should&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;learning.&nbsp;<br /><br />There's a reason for learning. Brigham Young said, "'Mormonism' includes all truth. There is no truth but what belongs to the Gospel. . . . If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We claim&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;truth. If that's the case, we all have a lot to learn. Because that means not just the scriptures, but physics, engineering, languages, music, literature, history, biology, economics, sociology, anthropology, and more. If you think that's a lot, remember that Heavenly Father is omniscient--he knows all. If we're to become like him, we must too. Remember that even when Christ was a young man, he had to learn. Luke 2:52 tell us, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."&nbsp;<br /><br />There's a purpose for this learning. Elder Dallin H. Oaks explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A learned Latter-day Saint should seek to understand the important religious, physical, social, and political problems of the day. The more knowledge we have of heavenly laws and early things, the greater influence we can exert for good on those around us and the safer we will be from scurrilous and evil influences that may confuse and destroy us.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Right now you're getting degrees and most of you think of your degrees as a means to get a job. But you need to broaden your perspective. Elder Oaks says knowledge "gives us greater influence . . . for good." The third principle of the BYU-I mission statement reads that we're here to "Prepare students for lifelong learning, for employment, and for their roles as citizens and parents."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Notice it doesn't say you're here to learn how to be rich, although that's not a bad thing. But in addition to preparing for employment, you should be preparing for lifelong learning and for you roles in the community and in your families. We sometimes talk about how eduction helps us with our families, I want to give you an idea of how education will allow us to help others in our community.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, my mom is a speech-langauge pathologist. Basically, she helps little kids talk better. That also means that as part of her job she works with a variety of kids with developmental and cognitive delays. She works in special educaiton classrooms. For most of her life in the church, she's been called to the Primary. And she's always given the class that no one else can control. Once she had a class of twelve kids, three of whom had ADHD. And she was their teacher for two years because no one else could handle them. When a boy with Down's syndrome arrived in the nursery, Mom was put in nursery. And when he moved to Sunbeams, so did she. That's happened to her so many times, she's lost track. But because of her degree, her training, she's better able to serve in the chruch.&nbsp;<br /><br />In another occasion, a fried of mine, got a master's degree in information sytems. When she and her husband moved to a new town in the midwest where there were very few Mormons, she was asked by a neighbor to help the local library choose a new computer system. My friend told me she spent ten mintues consulting on the system, and hours explaining the beliefs of the church. Not only did she help serve her community, she was given missionary opportunities because of her degree. Your education, too, can give you a "greater influence . . . for good."<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>3.Good to Share</strong><br />In Nursery, we learn to share and to take turns. And sharing is difficult for little kids. One study found that most children don't share without some guidance and encouragement until they're seven or eight years old.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;But in nursery--whether it's the toys or the puzzles or the crayons--we share. That seems pretty obvious, but can you image if during the middle of buying groceries, the store clerk taped your shoulder and said your time for using the cart was up and you needed to give it to someone else? Or, worse, what if, in the middle of the day, you had to give up your parking spot because someone else needed a turn.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sharing is hard, but it leads to great things.&nbsp;<br /><br />Right after Christ's visit to the Nephites, it's recorded, "And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift. . . . And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />One extraordinary example of sharing comes from LDS history. We frequently hear of the faith and determination of the members of the Martin and Willie Handcart companies--more than 1000 poor immigrants who fought all sorts of hardships to make it to the Salt Lake Valley in fall 1856. As most of you remember, they were caught in early snowstorms, and having a horrible time crossing the plains. After hearing of their plight, President Brigham Young stood up in October general conference and told the members there "Go and bring in those people now on the plains."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;He didn't stop to ask, as we often do: Have they worked hard enough? Do they really need my help?&nbsp;<br /><br />And the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley heeded the call to help. Right there in general conference, people volunteered to go get the immigrants stuck on the plains. Within three days, sixteen wagon teams had set out and within three weeks, there were 250 wagons.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;Here's the thing to remember. The people in the Salt Lake Valley weren't having an easy time. The harvests of 1854 and 1855 had been horrible, followed by an even worse winter. One historian put it this way: "The famine of 1855-56 had impoverished [Utah] Territory in its agricultural resources; the handcart emigration had brought to the country several thousand poor people, destitute, after their terrible journey, of even the barest clothing."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;Remember, that same year three handcart companies full of the poorest saints had already arrived to the Salt Lake Valley, needing help. And there wasn't a lot to go around. Heber C. Kimball wrote to his son that they were rationing food in early 1856. By fall, things weren't much better. By early October, when the call came to help those stuck on the plains, some people didn't even have their own harvests in because winter had lasted so long into the spring.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;And yet when hearing that there were saints in trouble--somewhere on the trail between Utah and Nebraska--they didn't even know where--they just went.&nbsp;<br /><br />And what supplies did they take? Their own. Their own food, their own clothes, their own blankets, their own wagons and teams. They took things from their own kids to give them to people they'd never even met. They left their families to get someone in trouble--someone they didn't even know.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;And those who went traveled from the Salt Lake Valley for Eastern Wyoming. They went&nbsp;<em>back</em>&nbsp;350 miles. In fact, from Winter Quarters, Nebraska to Salt Lake is 1000 miles. The members of the rescue party made that 1000 mile journey for their families. And then they 700 more miles--350 there and 350 back, in an early winter, to go get people they didn't even know.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I think of the story of the handcart companies, I think about the people who&nbsp;<em>went back.</em>&nbsp;They risked their own lives and really the lives of the own families to help others. Can you imagine doing that?<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Let me give you a modern example. When I was in graduate school at Washington State University, at the end of winter semester I had just moved into a new apartment with my previous roommate, Amy. Ellen, our new roommate, was going home for the summer because she had a great internship lined up. Ellen's home was Juneau, Alaska. So just as I was moving in, she was taking off for the summer. Ellen had packed up everything she owned in her little pickup, planning to store her stuff at her sister's house, across the state, 6 hours away, in Olympia, Washington. The next day, she was supposed to catch her flight from Seattle to Juneau so she could start her internship the following day. She was on a tight schedule. Of course, disaster struck. In the middle of nowhere, Ellen's pickup broke down. This is in the 1990s--before everyone had cell phones. Ellen found someone nice who drove her to the closest town and she was at a service station, waiting for the tow-truck driver. In despair, Ellen called us. My roommate Amy answered the phone. The next thing I knew, Amy was grabbing her coat and keys. She was going to get Ellen. Now, I don't remember what Amy had planned for that weekend, but it certainly wasn't a 700-mile 12-hour round trip across Washington State 350 miles there and 350 miles back. I felt ashamed.&nbsp;<em>My</em>&nbsp;first thought hadn't been to go get Ellen. But, I rationalized that Amy and Ellen were practically family. Ellen had been roommates with Amy's two older sisters and had even spent holidays with their family. So then I didn't feel quite so bad.&nbsp;<br /><br />But there's more to this story. Amy wasn't the only angel that day. Again, since this was in the days before cell phones, I was supposed to be the message relay at our apartment. Ellen would call to tell me where she was with the tow truck, and Amy was supposed to call to find out Ellen's location. In the midst of my waiting, my parents called to see how my new apartment was--I had just moved in. I explained what had happened with Ellen's pickup and told them I had to get off the phone. Then my stepdad said something I'll never forget. He said, "Wait, she's in trouble. Where is she? I'll go get her." He was ready to drive across the state, six hours each way, to help a girl he had never even met. He probably would have driven her to Alaska. After I convinced him that Ellen would be okay with Amy's help, he let me hang up the phone, but only after I promised him updates about whether Ellen made it safely to her sister's house in Olympia. Later, I asked my stepdad why he was willing to help my brand new roommate--a girl he'd never met and he stated plainly--"she needed help. I'd want someone to help you."&nbsp;<br /><br />How often do we answer the call or even volunteer to go get those in need? How often do we grab our keys and go? Or say "I'll go get her."&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin gives us a similar test about sharing and helping others. As he gives his great sermon, he reminds us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish. Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Can you imagine if Brigham Young and the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley had said that of the Martin and Willie Handcart companies? Eh-It's their own problem. They brought this upon themselves. It's their &nbsp;own fault. Fortunately, they didn't.&nbsp;<br /><br />King Benjamin continues and tells us why we should not judge those in trouble: "But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Even better, King Benjamin gives us a test: "And again, I say unto the poor. . . you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;There's our test. We have to be able to answer honestly, "If I had, I would give."&nbsp;<br /><br />Presidesnt Hinckley reminds us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are so many who are hungry and destitute across this world who need help. . . Ours is a great and solemn duty to reach out and help them, to lift them, to feed them if they are hungry, to nurture their spirits if they thirst for truth and righteousness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are so many young people who wander aimlessly and walk the tragic trail of drugs, gangs, immorality, and the whole brood of ills that accompany these things. . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My brethren and sisters, I would hope, I would pray that each of us. . . would resolve to seek those who need help, who are in desperate and difficult circumstances, and lift them in the spirit of love into the embrace of the Church.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p><strong>4. Life will have disappointments and difficulties</strong><br />This picture of the First Vision is from Nursery manual. It's by Walter Rane and it's quite nice. The traditional picture of the first vision focuses on Heavenly Father and Jesus. But this one focuses on Joseph. We can see him about to pray. One of my partners in Nursery was teaching the lesson about the First Vision. She did a very nice job. Sunbeams know the Joseph Smith story--no problem. But the nursery kids are younger. So the teacher showed this picture and said, "Look, here's Joseph Smith, he's kneeling in the woods. What is he doing?" And one of the little Nursery kids piped up--"He's looking for pokies!" Now, for those of you who don't speak three-year old, pokies are stickerbushes or branches that can poke you and hurt you. That little girl was exactly right. Think of what happened to Joseph Smith right before he prayed? The adversary came. What happened to the members of the Martin and Willie handcart companies? They had some real "pokies."&nbsp;<br /><br />The Doctrine and Covenants reminds us, we'll all have to have difficulties. "Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son. For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember that Abraham and Sarah had waited years to have their son Isaac. And then Abraham was commanded to sacrifice Isaac. Although an angel came to stop Abraham, it wasn't until the last minute--until Abraham had already in his heart given up his son Isaac.&nbsp;<br /><br />We, too, "must be chastened and tried as Abraham." We usually think of "chastened" as being reprimanded, or corrected. Yelled at. But chasten has the same root as "chastity," meaning to purify.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;We all must be purified. That which is most difficult for us is what will be asked of us. And that will be different for each of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />This can sound scary. But it's not meant to be. "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;We are not left alone in our trials. Although an angel might not appear to us, we always have the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide and comfort us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our trial might not be as radical as what Abraham and Sarah faced, or what the Saints in 1856 faced. It might just be life.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Hinckley used to like quoting the following statement, originally printed in the&nbsp;<em>Deseret News</em>: "[The fact is] most putts don't drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. ...Life is like an old-time rail journey--delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Church, we often talk about "enduring to the end." That old-time rail journey sounds like a lot of enduring. But "enduring" sounds like a pretty rotten thing. One passage of scripture reminds us what "enduring to the end" is all about: "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore if ye shall press forward, feasting up on the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_01_29_Moen.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />You and I can do this: "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, [have] a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men."&nbsp;<br /><br />And we can do it by remembering the lessons from the children of the church: be yourself, love learning, share what you have, and be ready for life's pokies.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I love Brigham Young University-Idaho and I love the students who attend here. I've been blessed by my church service on campus and the opportunities it has given me to more deeply know of your great faith and your enthusiasm for living the gospel. A former ward member, a wonderful sister currently serving a mission in France, was recently discussing in an email her companionship's effort to aid those who are less active in their reigniting of the gospel fire in their lives.<br /><br />She boldly wrote to her friends and family, "Making and keeping covenants is so vital. Raise your hand if you've made a covenant with God! Now keep your hand raised if you are keeping your covenants! If your hand is down, I suggest you make some changes/call the missionaries. Cool. Glad that's settled. If you live the commandments and keep your covenants, the gospel will bring you more joy than you can ever keep track of." I hope to borrow some of her boldness in discussing covenant keeping today.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1986, I was contemplating two great gifts in my life. I had a wife and I had hair.&nbsp; Now while I was grateful for both, I knew that the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;and sure enough, I was blessed to be the oldest grandson of Stanford Alma Burnham, a man of great wisdom and no hair--none--we are talking billiard ball smooth. Once he caught me bemoaning my genetically predicted future (I had just learned of the male pattern baldness gene and its bestowal through your mother's father side of the family). He said in all seriousness, "Jeffery, don't think of it as&nbsp;<em>less hair</em>; think of it as&nbsp;<em>more face.</em>"&nbsp; And thus I have ever thought. I am grateful today, in fullness of face, to address you.&nbsp;<br /><br />So it was 1986 and I did have two great blessings, and one was the year and half long marriage to my best friend in all the earth and the second blessing was the anticipation of a visit from my parents. Kristi and I lived in Provo, feeling fully actualized as kind of a Bobby and Betty BYU: both of us working on our marriage and family majors, both of us teaching missionaries at the Missionary Training Center, and both of us making 475 square feet of apartment space into a home--our home.&nbsp;<br /><br />A year and a half into that married bliss, my parents were coming to Salt Lake City for my father to receive back surgery. My father was due for a several week recuperation, which would place him under my mother's direct care and they would both be staying at the home of my wife's parents and within visiting range of two dirt-poor college students.&nbsp;<br /><br />Near the end of my parents' time with us, my father presented me with a poem. I had received other letters and thoughts from my father over the years, but I had never received a poem. It had my interest. Now my father was a man who would sit by my childhood bedside and explain in vivid detail how cells work, how blood flowed though veins and arteries, how muscle and bone combined to help us run and walk and move. He knew things about stars in the sky, about pine trees in the White Mountains of Arizona. He had been a seminary teacher, turned deputy sheriff; he wore boots and had a shiny badge. He made seemingly endless piles of French toast and homemade syrup every Saturday morning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mom and Dad had nine of us, and &nbsp;providing for such a brood saw my Dad take weekend security jobs at ASU football games or lonely midnight shifts securing shopping malls and stores. Those long nights offered him the occasional respite to sit and ponder. During one of these late night vigils, he once penned an 11-point document entitled, "True Happiness: What I Want To Teach My Children." To me, it reads like scripture, for example, this counsel, "Happiness follows effort.&nbsp; It occurs when the mind is at peace with the soul and the heart, when we are&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;with ourselves.&nbsp; It frequently occurs in the midst of hardship, trial, poverty, pain. It is frequently absent in the midst of wealth, ease, comfort and physical pleasure."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;My father thought often of his children and how he might teach us principles of happiness, even when he could not be physically present. And once again he was teaching me, this time through poetry.&nbsp;<br /><br />The poem tells of a young husband and father, who has gone into the mountains near his home to have solitary communion with his Heavenly Father in prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The young man has a plea:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What gift can I give dear Father,<br />To show my love for thee?"</p>
<p>The Father responds:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There is no gift that thou canst bring<br />Except thyself--just thee"</p>
<p>The man is perplexed and seeks to probe further, but the response, "only thyself--just thee" is all he receives that morning and he must head down into the fields of his day's work, pondering over this message from the Lord.&nbsp; Near the end of his day, weary and worn, he returns home and coming up the path is greeted by shouts of joy and hugs from his small child. The heart of this young father is filled near to bursting with love for his child. Slowly, with his little one clasped in his arms, the father turns and looks again at the mountain where earlier that day he had poured out his heart regarding something holy he could offer to the Heavenly Father he loved so much. It seemed to the young man as the last stream of sunlight hits the mountain peak that he felt an answer pierce his heart.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes, go to the mountain for comfort,<br />Go to the mountain to pray<br />Yet it's here in the valley you're shaping<br />The gift you will offer one day<br />Work while that day is offered<br />Give to the task at hand<br />Serve with a heart that is open<br />With love for your fellowman<br />Yes, go the mountain for comfort<br />Go to the mountain to pray<br />But remember my son it's the valley<br />Where you're forging your life for that day<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I desire to speak today of gifts of self that can be offered heavenward and also forward in time to the hands and hearts of the generation that will take your place. I believe that your hearts can turn even now to your children. President Henry B. Eyring has said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God knows our gifts. My challenge to you and to me is to pray to know the gifts we have been given, to know how to develop them, and to recognize the opportunities to serve others that God provides us. But most of all, I pray that you will be inspired to help others discover their special gifts from God to serve.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn4" target="_self"></a></sup>Soon after I had received this poem from my father, the president of Brigham Young University, Jeffrey R. Holland, had a talk published in the Ensign magazine.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Knowing how you feel about President Clark, as the president during your time at this university, I'm hoping you can appreciate what I felt for my university president. I would devour anything printed or published by President Holland, who served at BYU from 1980-1989. He and Sister Holland often spoke together at the beginning of each semester as do President and Sister Clark. In our day those beginning of the semester devotionals were popularly known on the Provo campus as, "the Jeff &amp; Pat Show" and we loved to gather, as you do now, to hear our President and First Lady give us counsel.</p>
<p>A certain story from that talk had a profound influence on my understanding of what it means to be a father. &nbsp;President Holland described a scene he chanced upon while walking through the Salt Lake International Airport following a lengthy trip he had just completed. In those pre-9/11 days you could accompany a friend or family member right to the boarding area before they departed or be present at the gates to greet loved ones who had just flown home. President Holland said that as he came into the terminal that, it was clear there was a missionary returning home due to all the "conspicuous-looking missionary friends and missionary relatives" around the terminal. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I tried to pick out the immediate family members. There was a father who did not look particularly comfortable in an awkward- fitting and slightly out-of-fashion suit. He seemed to be a man of the soil, with a suntan and large, work-scarred hands....There was a mother who was quite thin, looking as if she had worked very hard in her life...[she seemed filled with] anticipation only the mother of a returning missionary could know. There was a beautiful girl who--well, you know about girls and returning missionaries. She appeared to be on the verge of cardiac arrest...Two or three younger brothers and sisters were running around, largely oblivious to the scene that was unfolding. I walked past them all and started for the front of the terminal. Then I thought to myself, 'This is one of the special human dramas in our lives. Stick around and enjoy it.'</p>
<p>Slipping into the back of the crowd and watching as passengers started coming off the plane, President Holland said he soon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Found [himself] starting to bet (Church-approved betting, of course) as to who would make the break first. I thought probably the girlfriend would want to most of all, but undoubtedly she was struggling with discretion. Two years is a long time, you know, and maybe one shouldn't appear too assertive. Then a look...convinced me that the mother was probably the one. She obviously needed to hold something, so the child she had carried and nurtured and gone down into the valley of the shadow of death to deliver would be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>Now we are going to leave President Holland there at the airport for a few minutes, betting with himself, but I promise we'll come back to him. Many of you have experienced this type of greeting upon your return from your time of service as a missionary or from military duty. And as you are reacclimatized to non-mission life you are inundated with questions about your plans for the future, and because you are, say, a red-blooded, Mormon male you declare with gravitas and a sense of mission, "Well I'm headed back to BYU-Idaho, because that's where the girlfriend is and I'm going to see how things work out with her. I'm going to room with my old companion, Elder Jones, my trainer, who taught me the ways of mission life there in the Coachabamburrino South District, where we both experienced dysentery and the joys of preaching the gospel together and bonded for life. I'm taking along this amazing new phone you all have given me, so I can update all the family and the thousands of other friends I've discovered I have, on every move I make throughout the day, complete with pictures; and you can know what I'm thinking about (deep, meaningful thoughts) revealed at any given moment, even whilst working out on the rowing machine in the Hart or standing in line in the Manwaring to get a frozen yogurt--suddenly noticing that sister from the 142nd Ward who we did the combined snowshoeing activity with, the one with the cute freckles on her nose--but yes those are my plans."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now those are marvelous plans and let's connect those plans to the Lord's plans for you. When the Prophet Joseph Smith experiences his nighttime visits with the Angel Moroni, in addition to discussing the all-important plates of gold containing the message that will change the world, this assigned angelic minister also:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament... instead of quoting [Malachi 4:5-6] as it reads in our books, he quoted...the fifth verse thus: Behold, I will reveal unto you the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng" target="_self">Priesthood</a>, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</p>
<p>He also quoted the next verse differently:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Malachi 4:5-6 reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</p>
<p>Note the differences between the Old Testament Malachi passage and the version given by Moroni to the young Joseph. The words&nbsp;<em>reveal, priesthood, plant&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;promises&nbsp;</em>stand as significant additions to our understanding of Elijah's purpose in returning to the earth. The Restoration is only, relatively speaking, a few minutes old, when the young seventeen-year-old Joseph is told of sealing power and promises made to fathers and promises planted by God through Elijah into the hearts of children and that if&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;doesn't happen then the whole point and purpose of the earth is wasted. And the questions I'd invite you to consider are: What is&nbsp;<em>this priesthood</em>? What is it that is supposed be in my heart that will cause me to turn? Where or toward what am I turned in my life right now? And how do I turn?&nbsp;<br /><br />Twelve and a half years after this night with Moroni, Joseph Smith will stand with Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple and the priesthood keys that will seal and make families eternal are restored by that very prophet Elijah. And when Elijah speaks, he returns to the language of Malachi when he says, "Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi...To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elijah has come to turn hearts of children to their fathers and also to&nbsp;<em>turn</em>&nbsp;the hearts of the fathers, which appears to suggest that the fathers need to&nbsp;<em>turn from</em>&nbsp;whatever direction they are facing and&nbsp;<em>turn toward</em>&nbsp;their children. Perhaps a brief quotation here from an apostle who served the Church during your grandparents era, Elder Matthew Cowley, can aid us as he describes unique gifts to both women and men, that aid us in turning our hearts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You sisters...belong to the great sorority of saviorhood...[and while you] may not hold the priesthood...You are born with an inherent right, an inherent authority, to be the saviors of human souls. You are the co-creators with God of his children. Therefore, it is expected of you by a right divine that you be the saviors and the regenerating force in the lives of God's children here upon the earth.</p>
<p>Our sisters can draw upon many notable examples of such savior-work, beginning with Mother Eve. Sister Patricia Holland shared regarding Eve that she:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Was given the identity of, 'the mother of all living,' years, decades, perhaps even centuries before she ever bore a child. It would appear that her&nbsp;<em>motherhood preceded her maternity</em>, just as surely as the perfection of the Garden preceded the struggles of mortality.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>That phrase, "her motherhood preceded her identity" suggests something of the heartfelt pondering that can occur for you young women, over the children that you will "mother" in the future. Would not such reflection, the turning of your heart now to your children, influence choices you make each day?&nbsp;<br /><br />Concerning men, Elder Cowley went on to teach taught that, "Men are different, men have to have something given to them to make them saviors of men, but not mothers, not women."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; Priesthood power is given to my brethren that might make saviors of us. Elijah restores specific priesthood keys which unlocks a pathway into "that order of the priesthood meaning the new and ever-lasting covenant of marriage."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;We as men learn in that order of the Priesthood to do as the Apostle Paul directed, "to love our wives even as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a>&nbsp;</sup>And then in accord with heaven's timing, and the choices made as husband and wife, we can let our hearts turn to our children. Consider a great archetype, which has been placed before us in the life of Father Abraham.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Abraham's own record found in the Pearl of Great Price, this patriarch among patriarchs recounts his own journey and pilgrimage, forsaking the world of idol worship that belonged to, &nbsp;"My fathers [they] having turned from...righteousness, and...[now turned] unto the worshiping of the gods of the heathen."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;Instead Abraham chose a different path, to find and serve and receive knowledge from the true and living God (see Jeremiah 1:10).&nbsp;Again from his own record Abraham tells us that he desires:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To be one who possessed great knowledge...<br />To be a greater follower of righteousness...<br />To possess a greater knowledge...<br />To be a father of many nations...<br />A prince of peace...<br />Desiring to receive instructions...<br />And [desiring] to keep the commandments of God.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>After stating this desire, Abraham then pursued with full energy of heart, the course that led to the life that the Father lives. Abraham 1 and chapters 12-15 of Genesis present us with test after test that unfolded for Abraham: his faith tested as he lay on an altar, his own life about to be sacrificed; his marriage tested while waiting on the Lord for the protection of Sarah who is in the Egyptian Pharoah's bedchamber; Abraham's trust in the Lord's promise of land was tested when he and his nephew Lot struggled to make use of the land; his desire for peace was tested after reaping the spoils of war in the battle of the four kings in which Abraham rescued Lot and could have chosen to rule as a conquering king; time after time Abraham demonstrated the integrity of his heart and his focus on becoming a greater follower of righteousness, one who is seeking to establish Zion, to serve as a prince of peace.&nbsp;<br /><br />My wife shared with me recently a picture found posted on that genius collective mind known as Facebook. The image is of a Jane Austen, Victorian-era type woman clasping the arm and looking into the face of her gallantly dressed gentleman/super-hero of her day. The caption reads, "'When I grow up I want to marry a grown man addicted to playing video games.' Said no woman ever." My brothers what is it you desire to&nbsp;<em>become</em>?&nbsp; Elder Richard G Scott has taught, "We&nbsp;<em>become</em>&nbsp;what we want to&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;by consistently&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;what we want to&nbsp;<em>become</em>&nbsp;each day. Righteous character is a precious manifestation of what you are becoming."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;Let us examine yet another example of testing from Abraham's life and a choice he made that reveals his character, and demonstrates how one can turn their heart to their children, even before they are born.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Genesis chapter 15, Abraham seeks to better understand the covenant promises made to him by the Lord. Abraham and Sarah have both been faithful through the multiple tests and trials. And yet the promised child for Sarah and himself has not been born. Thus in this chapter Abraham, now in his 80s, wonders if perhaps he has misunderstood what God intended. &nbsp;Does God desire that Abraham's house be established through the lineage of Eliezer, Abraham's faithful steward?&nbsp; There may be occasions in mortality where some of us wonder with Abraham about the timing of the Lord's promises. In the words of Elder Richard G. Scott:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some of you may feel lonely and unappreciated and cannot see how it will be possible for you to have the blessings of marriage and children or your own family. All things are possible to the Lord, and He keeps the promises He inspires His prophets to declare. Eternity is a long time. Have faith in those promises and live to be worthy of them so that in His time the Lord can make them come true in your life. With certainty, you will receive every promised blessing for which you are worthy.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;"And the word of the Lord came unto [Abraham, in answer to his question] saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp; And the Lord takes Abraham out under the stars, "Look now toward heaven and tell the stars [count the stars], if thou be able to number them...so shall thy seed be."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The King James Version tells us that Abraham believed the Lord, but the Joseph Smith Translation of this verse at this point adds significant detail, describing how the Lord chose to show in vision the life of Jesus Christ, which made Abraham glad and his soul found rest in what the Lord had revealed. Ancient rabbinical sources and other apocryphal writings that have only recently come to light and would not have been available in Joseph Smith's day further describe this vision as one that may well have included a heavenly journey by Abraham into the very throne room of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />Led by a heavenly messenger, Abraham is shown the city of Enoch, or Zion. A blessing that Abraham had long sought for was to unite with Enoch's Zion, and it would appear that in this setting that Abraham is told by the Lord to state whatever he desires and it would be his. Looking out over this heavenly splendor of Zion, "it appears that Abraham could have asked for and received this gift, but chose otherwise: he chose to remain on earth to receive fulfillment of the blessing of a posterity that would bless the earth, bless all nations and build Zion"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;here in mortality. In essence, Abraham makes his choice and says simply, "I want to be a dad."&nbsp;<br /><br />My good brothers, reflect on your desire to be a dad. By your choices each day you are&nbsp;<em>becoming</em>&nbsp;what you will&nbsp;<em>be</em>. Join Abraham in the great journey to become something, a greater follower of righteousness, a father who seeks to care for the next generation, and pursue the priesthood order, even the new and everlasting covenant of marriage (see D&amp;C 131:2) that leads to fatherhood and to motherhood and to saviorhood. Within that order of the priesthood--with sealing power restored by Elijah--is the divine sanction given to create a life together. &nbsp;The distractions and dead ends that Satan seeks to lure you away with are certainly numerous and challenging, but we can demonstrate our faithfulness while enduring the tests that come our way, even as father Abraham, by reminding ourselves of what we desire to become.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had occasion once to visit with a young man who shared a source of strength for him in turning away from the temptations of pornography. A bishop had once counseled him to consider his own feelings if ever he were to find his own father viewing such images, "How would you feel?" The young brother described the disappointment and sorrow he imagined would come if ever he found his father in such a setting.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then the bishop asked, &nbsp;"How would you feel if your own children saw you?"&nbsp;<br /><br />What if we all followed such counsel when faced with temptations to tamper with this procreative power?&nbsp;Picture him, your son, with your spouse's eyes and your nose and that Stanford Burnham hairdo. Picture her, your daughter, with hair and a smile that says, "I'm here, love me."&nbsp;<br /><br />Such pictures held in your mind's eye, "the eye of faith."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp; will aid you to turn away from other images and thoughts that would otherwise seek to divide you from the love you will share with an eternal companion. Satan desires that you burn isolated and alone in lust, separated from the children you could have here and in eternity. Remember that Elijah himself has come to help you turn your heart to the promises made to your children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most recently from Elder D. Todd Christofferson has come this timely counsel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We must be men that women can trust, that children can trust, and that God can trust...We cannot afford young men who lack self- discipline and live only to be entertained. We cannot afford young adult men who are going nowhere in life, who are not serious about forming families and making a real contribution in this world....We cannot afford to have those who exercise the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God, waste their strength in pornography or spend their lives in cyberspace...Brethren, we have work to do...Take heart and prepare the best you can, whatever your circumstances. Prepare to be a good husband and father.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn20" target="_self">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, there is the greatest source of example and strength to aid us in our knowledge about turning our hearts to our children. Elder Holland taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of the many magnificent purposes served in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, one great aspect of that mission often goes uncelebrated...It is the grand truth that in all that Jesus came to say and do, including and especially in His atoning suffering and sacrifice, He was showing us who and what God our Eternal Father is like, how completely devoted He is to His children in every age and nation. In word and in deed Jesus was trying to reveal and make personal to us the true nature of His Father, our Father in Heaven."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn21" target="_self">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Jesus is showing us how completely the Father has remembered the promises he has made to his children, showing us how completely the Father has turned his heart towards us. "For God so loved the world that he&nbsp;<em>gave</em>&nbsp;his only begotten son."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you remember earlier we left then-President Holland standing in an airport terminal? He is still there wondering who will greet this returning missionary. Suddenly the missionary appears, exiting the plane.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He looked like Captain Moroni, clean and handsome and straight and tall...his suit was worn but clean, his slightly tattered raincoat was still protecting him from the chill his mother had so often warned him about. He came to the bottom of the steps and started out across...toward our building and then, sure enough, somebody [in the crowd of family and friends] couldn't take it any longer. It wasn't the mother, and it wasn't the girlfriend...[It was the father]. That big, slightly awkward, quiet and bronzed giant of a man put an elbow into the ribcage of a flight attendant and ran, just simply ran, out onto that [airfield] and swept his son into his arms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[The elder] was probably 6&prime;2&Prime; or so, but this big bear of a father grabbed him, took him clear off his feet, and held him for a long, long time. He just held him and said nothing. The boy dropped his briefcase, put both arms around his dad, and they just held each other very tightly. It seemed like all eternity stood still, and for a precious moment the Salt Lake City Airport was the center of the entire universe. It was as if all the world had gone silent out of respect for such a sacred moment.</p>
<p>And then, Pres. Holland said:</p>
<p>I thought of God the Eternal Father watching his boy go out to serve, to sacrifice when he didn't have to do it, paying his own way, so to speak, costing everything he had saved all his life to give. At that precious moment, it was not too difficult to imagine that father speaking with some emotion to those who could hear, 'This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' And it was also possible to imagine that triumphant returning son, saying, 'It is finished. Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.'<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_2_05_Chapman.htm#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Oh Father, what gift can I offer,<br />To show my love for thee?"<br /><em>My Son, you have given the one gift that matters<br /></em><em>It is thyself, just thee.</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, may we all give of ourselves and seek diligently to turn hearts, beginning with our own, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be here today and to feel the spirit you bring. Thank you for your preparation for this devotional and for your presence here.<br /><br />I would like to start today by asking you to think with me of the prayers we read about in the scriptures. Of the many prayers in the scriptures, which come to your mind? Perhaps you think of Adam, who called upon God and offered sacrifices without knowing why--he did it simply because the Lord commanded it. Perhaps you remember Hannah's prayer, "Give unto thine handmaid a ... child."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;Or you may recall Daniel's brave prayers when "he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; even though he knew he would be thrown into a den of lions as a result.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you think of the time when the Lord prayed for you and for all His disciples? "As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;Perhaps to you the most memorable prayer in the scriptures is when the Savior pleaded, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Have you ever been in agony and prayed more earnestly?&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you have any experiences with prayer that stand out in your memory as especially meaningful?&nbsp;<br /><br />One experience our family had with prayer occurred years ago. On December 1, 1991, I wrote in my journal:&nbsp;<br /><br />Gert Karnitschnig visited here for 1 1/2-2 hours (sic)...The visit was mainly social but he did agree to watch a video [with us] tomorrow, receive a [missionary] discussion on Friday, and attend Church next week. The special part was when [our eight-year- old son] Nathan said, after Gert had gone, 'Well, at least our prayers got answered.'&nbsp;<br /><br />We had been trying and praying for weeks to have someone ready to hear the missionary lessons by that day, December 1. During the final week leading up to that day, most of the family had lost hope because we still could not think of anyone to invite. Our three-year-old son Seth, however, kept including our plea in every prayer, even the day before. During my morning prayer and quiet time on December 1, Gert's name came to my mind. I phoned him and he agreed to come to our home that same night.&nbsp;<br /><br />Gert was baptized and confirmed about one month later, on January 5. Later he said that he had been an atheist, but then he heard one of our children pray to bless the food. During that prayer he received an overwhelming manifestation of light and elation and peace. He knew the Lord had touched his heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />Prayers do get answered. Prayer&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;work. And my hope today is that through the music and words of this devotional, each of us will feel so deeply the miracle of daily prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ that we will want to pray always.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pray Always</strong><br />The Lord said, "Ye must always pray unto the Father in my name."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />This simple commandment is repeated in countless ways throughout the scriptures. We are told to pray continually&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;; to pray without ceasing&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>; to pray morning, mid-day, and evening&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>; and to counsel with the Lord in all our doings&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>. Simply put, Heavenly Father wants us to pray with faith every morning, every night, and often in between.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you pray with faith every morning, every night, and often in between, your life is better in every way than if you do not. You have the influence and power of the Holy Ghost. You choose the right more often. You avoid the wrong more often. You resist and avoid temptation more consistently.&nbsp;<br /><br />You think of others more readily. You love and serve your families, friends, and others better. You serve the Lord better.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you pray with faith every morning, every night, and often in between, you repent more promptly and more completely. You are better prepared for the blessings of the sacrament and the blessings of the temple. You share the gospel with others more frequently and with greater urgency and with deeper conviction.&nbsp;<br /><br />You are a better friend and you choose better friends. You do better at school and at work. You do better at sports and music and dancing and writing and speaking and any other righteous talent you pursue. Your mind works better. Your body works better. You are a better son, a better daughter, a better mother, a better father.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you pray with faith every morning, every night, and often in between, your successes are more meaningful. Your trials are more refining. Your sadness is shorter. Comfort and relief and strength come more quickly.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you pray with faith every morning, every night, and often in between, you feel closer to your Heavenly Father. You know Him better and have stronger faith in Him and in the Lord Jesus Christ. In pleasant times and in hard times, you know what They want you to do, and you are more apt to do it.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you pray in faith every morning, every night, and often in between, your life is better in every way than if you do not.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you do not pray in faith every morning, every night, and often in between, you live below your privileges. You forfeit blessings. You lose protection. You lose inspiration. You lose comfort. You lose opportunities. You lose light. You lose strength. Again, if you do not pray every morning, every night, and often in between, you live way below your privileges.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "Prayer is a marvelous and miraculous resource--the most marvelous and miraculous resource we have available to us."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson affirmed that praying will "solve more problems, alleviate more suffering, prevent more transgression, and bring about greater peace and contentment in the human soul than could be obtained in any other way."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Morning Prayer</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />I would like us, each one, to ponder this question: What importance should I place on&nbsp;<em>morning</em>&nbsp;prayer?&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures recount clearly the example of the Savior: "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We also remember that "it was on the&nbsp;<em>morning</em>&nbsp;of a beautiful, clear day" when Joseph Smith retired to the woods to pray aloud for the first time.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Of all the things we think we need to do in the morning, talking with our Heavenly Father is the first and most important.&nbsp;<br /><br />The practice of "praying first" has something in common with the practice of paying tithing first. Some say they don't have enough money to pay tithing. But when we pay our tithing first, the Lord blesses us to make better use of the remaining 90 percent than if we had not paid tithing. Similarly, some people think they don't have enough time to pray, especially in the morning. But when the first thing we do each morning is to speak sincerely and humbly with our Father in Heaven, the rest of our day is more meaningful and inspired and productive. Because we have sought Him in prayer, early and first, we accomplish much more of what is important.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is always time to pray. So let us pray always.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pray Anyway</strong><br />In spite of clear direction from the Lord and His servants, many seek to excuse themselves from praying every morning, every night, and often in between. But the Lord does not excuse anyone from the need to pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may feel, "I am not worthy to pray." But the Lord invites "all to come unto him."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;So pray anyway.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may object, "I don't feel like praying." But the Lord's servants say, "Kneel down and pray until you do feel like praying."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;So pray anyway.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may say, "I don't think God cares or even notices me." But He says, "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;So pray anyway.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may think, "I might pray for the wrong things." So don't pray for&nbsp;<em>things</em>. Pray to know&nbsp;<em>His</em>&nbsp;<em>will.</em>&nbsp;Pray to express thanks. Pray for other people. Pray anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You may rationalize, "I am angry." But the Lord says, "Be still."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp; And pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may argue, "I'm not sure I believe in God." So explain to God how you feel and ask Him to give you a desire to believe. Pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may say, "I don't feel like I get any answers." The Lord says He tests our patience and our faith, but He does hear and answer.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn19" target="_self">19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>So pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may protest, "I already prayed. I shouldn't pray too often." But the Lord says to pray always; to pray without ceasing; to be watchful unto prayer continually. You see, although it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;possible to pray with vain repetitions, it is very difficult to pray too often or too much, if we do so with faith and with real intent. So pray anyway--again.&nbsp;Nephi taught:<br /><br />If ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />So pray. Pray again. Pray still. Remember to pray always.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the great blessings of having our hearts "full, drawn out in prayer ... continually"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Prayer helps keep our eye single to the glory of God and our mind clear and our heart meek and grateful. Prayer opens a conduit through which the Holy Spirit can convey light, truth, knowledge, peace--all the gifts and fruits of the Spirit--without interruption. The Lord promised, "The Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp; And, "Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing--yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the words of President Packer: "Learn to pray. Pray often. Pray in your mind, in your heart. Pray on your knees. Prayer is your personal key to heaven. The lock is on your side of the veil."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn24" target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pray to the Father</strong><br />Remembering to pray always is easier when we remember we pray to God our Heavenly Father and to no one else. To you this may seem like a simple and obvious concept. But I invite you to consider with me what a powerful truth this is and the implications it should have for our prayers.&nbsp;<br /><br />God is our Eternal Father. He fathered your spirit and my spirit.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn25" target="_self"><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;There is none other equal to Him. He directed the creation of this world and countless others. He is the Father of Jesus Christ. He is the One Jesus calls Father and the One to whom Jesus prayed. He is the One to whom Jesus commands us to pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />All things are present with Him, including us--all of us and each one of us.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;He discerns our thoughts. He knows our strengths and weaknesses. He knows our desires and goals. He inspires us to make good choices, and He helps us recover when we make bad choices. He loves us. He is the Author of the plan of salvation, which is designed to help us not only return to Him but also become more like Him. His desire and interest and work and longing and His joy are for us to return to Him&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>receive eternal life with Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the Father in Heaven to whom we pray.&nbsp;<br /><br />While we live on earth, we feel separated from Him. Though it is true that we may not see Him now, it is not true that He cannot see us. As President Eyring recently explained, "The pavilion that seems to intercept divine aid does not cover God but occasionally covers us. God is never hidden, yet sometimes we are, covered by a pavilion of motivations that draw us away from God and make Him seem distant and inaccessible."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn27" target="_self"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord assured the early Saints: "Mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst and ye cannot see me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn28" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our family lived in Guatemala for three years. The national bird of Guatemala is the quetzal, distinguished by its bright red breast and long tail feathers. Male quetzals have tail feathers that are so long that people sometimes describe these beautiful birds as flying snakes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Once, in the middle of a very busy schedule, we managed to set aside a few hours as a family to visit a nature reserve where quetzal birds were known to nest, although sightings of the quetzal are most rare. As we hiked, a yearning welled up in me for my children to see one of these birds. After I prayed quietly for this blessing, I had the feeling to look up. When I did, on a branch immediately above me sat a beautiful, small, green bird with a bright, bright red breast. I motioned for the children to come see. We were elated. Then a startling thing occurred. The bird flew off the branch and came right past my side. It was so close I could feel the flutter of its wings as it passed me. I can still feel it when I recall the experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Immediately these words of Paul the Apostle came to my mind: "That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn29" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Being able to see this bird was a witness to me that our Father in Heaven had heard my prayer and that He is not far from any one of us. Sometimes, He is so close that we feel Him at our side.&nbsp;<br /><br />Think about the times when you have felt close to our Heavenly Father. Such experiences generally include prayer.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Packer taught:<br /><br />No Father would send His children off to a distant, dangerous land for a lifetime of testing where Lucifer was known to roam free without first providing them with a personal power of protection. He would also supply them with means to communicate with Him from Father to child and from child to Father...We are, none of us, left here alone without hope of guidance and redemption.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn30" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Every time we address our Heavenly Father, let us remember who He is. Before we rush on to list our blessings and put in our order for more blessings, let us pause and reflect well on the loving, powerful, knowing Father with whom we are speaking. And let us allow this knowledge to influence everything else we say in our prayer.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pray in the Name of Jesus Christ<br /></strong>Finally, we have been taught to close our prayers with the words "in the name of Jesus Christ."&nbsp;</p>
<p>But why do we pray in His name?&nbsp;<br /><br />We know that Jesus Christ is the firstborn spirit Son of our Heavenly Father and His Only Begotten Son in the flesh. He is the Messiah, the Redeemer. He is the director and administrator of God's plan for us. He is "the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn31" target="_self"><sup>31</sup></a>&nbsp; He is our Advocate with the Father. He is our Lord, our God, our King.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Father commanded us to pray in the name of the Lord because He is our Redeemer, and He promises great blessings when we do.&nbsp;<br /><br />He said to Adam and Eve that because of the Lord's atoning sacrifice, "Thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn32" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The promised blessing for praying in the name of the Lord is, "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn33" target="_self"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us can affirm that we have received blessings through keeping the commandment to pray to the Father in the name of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another, perhaps deeper question on this subject is: What does praying in the name of the Lord mean?&nbsp;<br /><br />First, let's be clear on what it does not mean. Praying in the name of the Lord does not mean that we pray to Him or through Him and that He conveys our prayers to the Father. That is not what it means. We pray directly to our Father in Heaven. There is no intermediary in that sense. We are commanded to pray always and only to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />In simple terms, praying to the Father in the name of the Lord means that our prayer is offered and activated by our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Anointed Redeemer. It means we have faith that the Lord's atoning mercy and grace allows us to pray to the Father now and eventually bring us back into the presence of the Father.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn34" target="_self"><sup>34</sup></a>&nbsp;And it means we desire to be identified with Jesus Christ; to be called by His name; to accord our will to His will; and to follow, love, obey, and serve Him.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn35" target="_self"><sup>35</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Each time we pray to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ, as inspired by the Holy Ghost, we prefigure our ultimate reconciliation with Them in the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;<br /><br />All this, and more, is what it means to pray in the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />While yet in mortality, Jesus said to His disciples, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn36" target="_self"><sup>36</sup></a>&nbsp; We often gain access to places and privileges in the world if we present ourselves with the right name. Similarly, we gain access to our Heavenly Father--both eternally as well as every morning, every night, and often in between--when we present ourselves with the right name: the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Can you see that praying in the name of the Lord is far more than a formalized way to close a prayer? Each of us can try harder to honor the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and pronounce it reverently. In the Old Testament He was known as Jehovah. His followers revered His name so much that they would not pronounce it aloud. Since we have been commanded to finish our prayer by pronouncing His holy name, shall we not do so in a manner that reflects our love for Him and our faith in Him?&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Miracle of Prayer</strong><br />Brothers and sisters, we have talked now about praying always and about remembering that we pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. Before concluding, could we pause and consider the miracle of prayer? Think of the last time you received an answer to prayer. If we had the time, we could pass a microphone up and down the rows and each one of you could recount a personal experience with prayer. While we should pray every day, continually, there is nothing ordinary or automatic or formulaic or common about prayer. Every time we sincerely pray to the Father in the name of the Lord, a unique, sacred miracle occurs.&nbsp;<br /><br />And the miracle is not simply that you found your lost car keys or that you remembered the right answer on the test or even that you received an answer to an urgent question in your life, though these might be miracles you would recall. The miracle is that you actually talked with God and that He in fact heard&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;and answered you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Enoch marveled to God, "Were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn37" target="_self"><sup>37</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />He&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;there. And perhaps, more than answering the urgent plea of the moment, which He seems well-pleased to do, His greatest desire is to give you reason to believe and be sure that He&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>there and He is&nbsp;<em>your&nbsp;</em>Father and that through the infinite love and Atonement of His Beloved Son, our Lord, He can be merciful and generous and mindful of each one of us, for this is what He desires. And through the light of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost He can be present with each one of us in this life, until we can enter into His presence and become one with Him in life eternal.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson witnessed, "I testify that much ... joy comes as we recognize that we can communicate with our Heavenly Father through prayer and that those prayers will be heard and answered."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_12_Frischknecht.htm#_edn38" target="_self"><sup>38</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I know that God is our Father and that Jesus Christ, His Holy and Beloved Son, is our Redeemer. I know that the fullness of the gospel has been restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that the keys of God's kingdom are held and exercised today by our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. I know that all the blessings of daily prayer are available to each one of us. And I pray that every morning, every night, and often in between, we will seek and receive the blessings of praying always unto the Father in the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I offer this prayer, together with my faith and knowledge and witness that our Father in Heaven desires that we pray to Him always and blesses us beyond measure when we do, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Brigham Young University-Idaho is unparalleled as an institution of teaching and learning. Its power and influence for good continues to expand throughout the world. You are blessed to be here in this generation.<br /><br />The prophet Amulek, speaking to a people who had become distracted by trivial things, reminded them that "this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, . . . this life is the day for men to perform their labors."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;Today, I am here with a similar desire--to remind us all of the true purpose of mortal life in God's plan.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Premortal Life&nbsp;</strong><br />I begin by taking us back to a time and place lost to our memory--our premortal life. The scriptures tell us that before coming to live on this earth, we lived as spirit sons and daughters begotten by heavenly parents.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We know that our spirits consist of refined matter<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;in the same likeness of our mortal bodies.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;As spirits, we enjoyed the gift of agency and the opportunity to grow and progress in knowledge and intelligence.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, we were limited in the progress we could make as spirits. Heavenly Father, knowing our desires to grow, presented the plan that would open new possibilities for our development. The plan was to add a physical dimension to our being--a physical earth where we could obtain physical bodies and live separated from Him, relying on faith.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Living in physical bodies on the earth would provide new experiences and opportunities for growth.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;The excitement about this possibility created a feeling of great anticipation. The scriptures tell us when we heard the plan, we "shouted for joy."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;I suppose we were filled with wonder and joy anticipating what it would be like to have our spirit housed in a physical body that could experience the warmth of sunshine, the shock of a plunge into cold water, the comfort of a hug, and, probably most of all, the thrill of holding our own child in our arms.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Mortality</strong><br />Mortality is the state in which we now find ourselves. Each one present today has a spirit--the same spirit that lived in the premortal world--housed in a physical body.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;Each spirit brings to earth all of the knowledge, light, truth, and experiences of our pre-earth life. But a veil has been drawn over our minds so that we must live by faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />That spirit is joined with the physical body prepared for it by earthly parents, containing the physical and genetic characteristics of our earthly ancestors. Our bodies contain the mental and physical systems, susceptibilities, and tendencies that affect our health and our capacity to grow, think, and progress. The combination of our eternal spirit and mortal body define our being and essence in mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, our mortal state is limited and temporary. It will end with the death of our physical body. Death comes when the conditions necessary for our body to function can no longer be sustained, based on the physical laws of this mortal earth. At that time, our spirit will leave our body--retaining the knowledge, attributes and experiences we have obtained in mortality--and await a reunion with a perfected and glorified body in which to dwell eternally.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Realities of Mortality</strong><br />Each person is placed on the earth in a unique setting and circumstances. Despite our uniqueness, the Lord has revealed truths about the purposes of mortal life that apply to all of us. He established them with our first parents, Adam and Eve, and has reconfirmed them in our day. I refer to these truths as the "realities of mortality." If we are to gain the fullest blessings and benefits from our mortal experience, we must understand these realities. Failure to understand and focus on them will result in our time on earth being misspent, underutilized, and perhaps utterly wasted.&nbsp;<br /><br />Permit me to illustrate this point with a parable. It involves studying at a university--perhaps some of you can relate to that experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the parable:&nbsp;<br /><br />A student wanted to obtain a good education and chose the university that she wanted to attend. She worked diligently to qualify, studying hard during high school, preparing to take the required qualifying tests, working to save money, and participating in other preparatory activities. Happily, she was admitted. She arranged for her housing, signed up for a meal plan, and registered for classes that sounded interesting. When she got to the university, she saw that there were many more exciting things to do--besides schoolwork--than she had anticipated. As a result, she went to class only when it didn't disrupt her other activities. She seldom completed her homework. She considered tests optional--especially the ones she knew would be hard. She focused on things that were convenient, interesting, and comfortable. After four years, she was shocked to learn that she wouldn't graduate. She had qualified for and paid the price for admission and had been on campus for four years, but she had failed to focus on and accomplish the very things she had come to college to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope this parable does not sound familiar to any of those listening today.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we are to accomplish our purposes here on earth, it is not enough that we were valiant and faithful in our pre-earth life. It is not enough that we have arrived on earth, have a mortal body, and will live here for a lifetime. To make our time here meaningful, we must live and experience the God ordained purposes of mortality--fully, completely, and whole-heartedly--rather than becoming distracted by things that are interesting, comfortable, and convenient.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden, they were in circumstances similar to what many of you are facing. They were beginning their adult life and looking forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead of them. The Lord prepared them by teaching them the realities they would experience in mortality. I want to review three of these realities with you today.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we begin, remember that there were those who did not receive mortal bodies because they did not keep their first estate. They are intent on preventing us from experiencing the fulness of mortality. They know we have paid tuition and are enrolled, and they seek to keep us from the experiences that lead to our mortal diplomas.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Reality Number One: Work</strong><br />God said to Adam, "By the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou shalt return unto the ground."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;Some characterize the Lord's words as a curse on Adam and his posterity for partaking of the forbidden fruit. However, I hear these as the words of a loving Father explaining to a young and inexperienced son the conditions in the fallen, mortal world in which the son will soon live. Like an earthly father preparing a son about to leave home, the Father of heaven is helping the first man prepare to live on his own away from home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Heavenly Father knew that Adam and Eve would soon have to struggle against the elements and the earth itself to provide food and the other necessities of life for them and their family. In contrast to their experiences in the garden, where everything was provided for them, mortal life would require physical and mental effort, sweat, patience, and persistence to survive. A kind Father was explaining that work was a new reality--a reality of mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />Learning to work--training and disciplining our minds, bodies, and spirits to exert, produce, achieve, and progress--is a foundation reality of every mortal life. It is the means by which we become like God and accomplish His purposes on the earth. Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost all work. Their work and their glory is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;The reality is there can be no glory without work.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the principal reasons men need to work is to provide for their families. "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," lists "provider" as one of the three roles given specifically to men. A man who knows how to work and provide for himself has the confidence that he can marry and provide for a wife and children. Bishop H. David Burton said:&nbsp;<br /><br />To work--honestly and productively--brings contentment and a sense of self-worth. Having done all we can to be self-reliant, to provide for our own needs and those of our family, we can turn to the Lord in confidence to ask for what we might yet lack.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan is ever alert to destroy the purposes of God and to subvert our mortal experience. To counter the emphasis the Father places on work, the adversary has convinced many in our day that a primary goal in life is to avoid work. In today's societies, many people concentrate on finding jobs that pay well but require little work, investments or schemes that pay high returns without effort, and programs that pay for what we want at no cost to us. Some seek to avoid work by borrowing and living on money they never intend to repay. They are unwilling to work, budget, and save before they spend. Our leaders have warned that we should work for what we obtain and avoid debt "except for the most fundamental of needs."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Another insidious tactic the adversary employs in this generation is to channel men's natural ambition to work and achieve into dead ends. God placed in young men the desire to compete and achieve, with the intent that they would use this ambition to become a faithful provider for a wife and family. In our youth, this ambition can be channeled into academic, athletic, or other pursuits that help to teach persistence, discipline, and work. However, Satan would subtly intercept that ambition and channel it into a virtual world of video games that eat up time and ambition, and lead to addiction.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Addiction," Elder Robert D. Hales taught, "is the craving of the natural man, and it can never be satisfied."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp; No matter how hard you play a video game, no matter what score you get, virtual work can never bring you the satisfaction that accompanies real work. Real work is the effort, persistence, patience, and discipline to achieve worthwhile knowledge, perform a needed labor, or accomplish a challenging goal.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we fail to learn to work while in mortality, we will fail to achieve our full potential and happiness in this life, and we will not develop the qualities and attributes required for eternal life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Reality Number Two: Eternal Marriage</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />When Adam and Eve were created, the scriptures say the Lord "blessed them."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn14" target="_self">14</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;In the language of our day, we would say that He performed a marriage or a sealing, binding them together as husband and wife. Eternal marriage is a second fundamental purpose or reality of mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />The goal of the Father is to give us everything that He has. The Lord has promised:&nbsp;<br /><br />Whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken . . . become . . . the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God. And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord; . . . he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; and he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be giveth unto him. And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our loving Father wants each of His children to receive everything--a fulness, His fulness. This does not mean giving us the deed to a nice little galaxy in a beautiful tropical universe. Rather, it implies His desire to share a fulness of His knowledge, His attributes, His power, His glory, and His joy. In another revelation, we learn that in order to receive this fulness "a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Eternal marriage and all that it is designed to help us learn and experience are the key to obtaining all of the blessings that the Father wants to give His children. Only a family--a man and a woman who live worthy to enter the house of the Lord and are sealed to each other--can be eligible. The full blessings of the priesthood are received together, as husband and wife, or not at all.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is interesting that in the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the Lord uses the verbs&nbsp;<em>obtain</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>receive</em>. He does not use the verb&nbsp;<em>ordain</em>. It is in the temple that men and women--together--obtain and receive the blessings and power of both the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods. Having received these blessings in the house of the Lord, it is principally in their home life where they develop godly characteristics and attributes--sacrificing for and serving each other, loving each other with full fidelity, and being united in their love for each other and God.&nbsp;<br /><br />A crowning moment in the Restoration occurred in 1835 in the Kirtland Temple when Elijah committed the keys of the sealing power back to the earth. His visit fulfilled the words spoken by Moroni to the Prophet Joseph twelve years earlier:&nbsp;<br /><br />Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. ... And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so,&nbsp;<em>the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Fulness, priesthood, family</em>--three related words, all encapsulated in the reality of eternal marriage. Doing all within our power to make eternal marriage a reality of our mortal life ensures that the earth and our mortal life on it will not be utterly wasted.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan, ever the deceiver, is abroad in our day twisting and distorting the realities of mortality. He is working overtime to destroy the very meaning and importance of marriage in the minds of men and women. To some, he sells the lie that marriage is not necessary, that love is enough. To others, he attempts to use legalized marriage to legitimize immoral relationships. To those diminishing few who believe in marriage, he lowers its priority in relation to education and financial security. He engenders fear of the sacrifices and difficulties associated with marriage. Frozen by fear, many sit still as objects being acted upon, rather than moving forward to act in faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some, overwhelmed by the demands of building real relationships, but feeling a desire for companionship and intimacy, are lured by false hope into the virtual world. Their encounters with "virtual" intimacy can bring nothing but greater emptiness, longing, and shame. Many are drawn into empty searching again and again until their pattern has become an addiction that can never be satisfied. They are caught in a cycle that gradually destroys their will to withstand. They still have their agency but not enough hope in their ability to resist. Caught in this web, they are at risk of missing out on one of the most important realities of mortality. If you are caught in this web--get help. Do not wait. To do so will delay your growth and progress in mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />Examine your life. Be sure that your mind has not been darkened by false ideas related to marriage. Remember that successful marriages are built on "faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp; Begin today to build those attributes into your personal life. As you do, the Lord will open the way for you to receive the fulness of the blessings He has prepared for His children--the new and everlasting covenant of marriage. Don't let your mortality be utterly wasted.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Reality Number Three: Bearing Children</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />At the time He "blessed" or sealed them to become the first family on earth, God gave Adam and Eve their first commandment: be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;Marriage and children go together. The procreative powers that make mortal birth possible are to be used only between a man and a woman, legally and lawfully wedded. On becoming mortal, Eve, and mortal women in general, became capable of conceiving and bringing forth children. Adam and Eve understood that children were an important reality of mortality. They were obedient to God's commandment, "and Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters, and they began to multiply and to replenish the earth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp; Prophets in our day have declared that "God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, in today's world few believe any longer that "children are an heritage of the Lord."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp; Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said in the October 2011 general conference:&nbsp;<br /><br />Many voices in the world today marginalize the importance of having children or suggest delaying or limiting children in a family. My daughters recently referred me to a blog written by a Christian mother (not of our faith) with five children. She commented: '[Growing] up in this culture, it is very hard to get a biblical perspective on motherhood. ... Children rank way below college. Below world travel for sure. Below the ability to go out at night at your leisure. Below honing your body at the gym. Below any job you may have or hope to get. Motherhood is not a hobby, it is a calling. You do not collect children because you find them cuter than stamps. It is not something to do if you can squeeze the time in. It is what God gave you time for.'<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Later in the same talk, Elder Andersen cited a story about President Kimball, who counseled a couple to remember the commandment to have children given by the Lord despite the fact that they were in medical school. President Kimball's question to them was, "Where is your faith?" That is a good question that all married couples need to ask themselves today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago, a couple who were about to marry came to me. They asked for my advice regarding children. I reminded them of the commandment they would receive when they were sealed and counseled them that it was a commandment that could only be kept by the two of them in consultation with the Lord. I reminded them that it is a commandment just like tithing or any other commandment. The question is not whether or not to keep it but how to do it in a way that is pleasing to and approved by the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />I watched as they started their marriage. He had a year left of undergraduate studies, and she had another year in a master's program. They felt directed to have their family immediately--despite the schooling and uncertainty over future jobs. It was not easy or convenient to have a child so soon. He had to search for a job, they had to move, and she had to finish her degree. There was stress and sacrifice. He had to rush home early and watch the baby while she completed her thesis and practical training. She studied and wrote between nursing and changing diapers.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has blessed and prospered them. While many others lost jobs in the economic turndown of 2008, he was retained and promoted. Because they lived frugally, they are out of debt except for a mortgage, and they have been able to completely pay for a master's program. All the while, they have continued to learn the valuable lessons that can come only with parenthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, my dear young sisters and brothers, together with agency, mortality is one of the greatest gifts our Father has given us. He loves us and wants us to use this gift fully and completely. Only by embracing and focusing on these realities can we fulfill the purposes for which we came to earth. Satan knows that he can do nothing to stop us from obtaining bodies, so now he tries to divert us from the purposes for which they were created--to work, to marry, and to bear children. Remember the young woman in the parable who worked so hard to get to the university only to neglect her purpose for being there. Let us not make that the story of our mortal lives--living aimlessly and without purpose, only to find in the end that we have spent our time on things disconnected from the realities of mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />The prophet Nephi saw our day. He saw that all had "gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_02_19_Pieper.htm#_edn24" target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;Let us avoid the illusions of the precepts of men and cling to the revealed realities given by God. That our journey through mortality may be rich, full, and real is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, it's a great honor to be with you today.&nbsp; In particular, it's an honor to have with me on the stand my wife and my five children.&nbsp; I love my family, and I am so grateful for that simple doctrine of the gospel, that families can be together forever.&nbsp; It seems like just yesterday that Amber and I were students at Ricks College.&nbsp; There's a simple scripture in D&amp;C: 45 that states, "For verily, I say unto you, that great things await you."&nbsp; Without question, that was true for Amber and me.&nbsp; Certainly, it is also true for you.</p>
<p>It was twenty-four years ago that I applied to one college and one college only--Ricks Junior College.&nbsp; I came to Ricks in the fall of 1989, to pursue two dreams: both equally important, both, for a 17-year-old boy, potentially devastating if not realized.&nbsp; First, I was quite certain at the time that acceptance to Ricks College would be the next step to what unquestionably would be a long and storied career as a professional baseball player.&nbsp; My second, and equally important dream was to pursue a certain redheaded girl and convince her that I was marriage material.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to report that I realized one of my dreams. I'll let you guess which one.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As a student at Ricks College, I knew that it was my responsibility to be at devotional every Tuesday at 2:00.&nbsp; I don't remember how I learned about this or who told me.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a roommate, that redheaded girl, or I was just smart enough to just follow the crowd.&nbsp; Whatever it was, every Tuesday, I found myself halfway up in section K of the Hart gym ready for devotional.&nbsp; Over the years, I have had numerous opportunities to attend and be taught at devotional.&nbsp; Often, I look around at you students and I think to myself, &nbsp;"What would I say to this massive student body if I ever had the chance?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, I guess today, we're going to find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As executive director for development for BYU&shy;-Idaho and a Director for LDS Philanthropies, it is my responsibility and that of my colleagues to travel this country and meet with those that have a philanthropic intent, or charitable desire, to make donations to the charitable priorities of the Church.&nbsp; These priorities include such things as: the general missionary fund, temple and the temple matrons fund, special projects (like the restoration of Church history sites), the Perpetual Education Fund, Humanitarian Aid projects (like disaster relief and clean water projects), and of course the institutions of higher education like BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we meet with these donors we go well armed.&nbsp; We can tell them about such things as enrollment projections.&nbsp; We can talk about current construction projects, including everything from new and remodeling projects to landscaping and parking.&nbsp; (Well, we don't really like to talk about parking; no one likes to talk about parking).&nbsp; We talk about programs like Pathway and Activities and even take with us a small library of videos explaining the priorities of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the end, however, there is really only one thing that anyone wants to talk about.&nbsp; They want to talk about you.&nbsp; They want to know how you're doing.&nbsp; They want to know if you're going on missions, if you're getting married.&nbsp; They want to know if you're finding the classes you need, the internships that will be productive, and the jobs that you desire.&nbsp; And of course, for those that attended here, they want to know if there is still a special spirit about this place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, we're all here.&nbsp; I could ask, "How are you doing?"<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But I don't have to.&nbsp; I don't have to because the answer to that question was given long before any one of you stepped foot on this campus as a student.&nbsp; The answer to that question comes from prophecy spoken by then Elder Henry B. Eyring in a devotional address. When speaking about the future of this place and the possibility that he might someday meet someone that employs one of you, he stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Come with me to Rexburg." And I may not be able to show it to you, and I may not be able to prove it to you, but you'll feel it. There will be a spirit here, I so testify, because of the love of God for all of His faithful children. And those blessings will be poured out here in rich abundance."</p>
<p>Yes, there is still a special spirit about this place.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, if there was one thing that I would say to this great student body.&nbsp; It would simply be, "Thank you."&nbsp; Thank you for understanding that the honor code is so much more than just a list of dos and don'ts.&nbsp; Thank you for understanding that personal honor and integrity isn't just something you do on campus, or during the years that you are here in Rexburg, but that it is a way of life.&nbsp; Thank you for knowing what it means to be a disciple leader and that being called a leader with a small&nbsp;<em>L</em>&nbsp;is a great privilege and honor in our Heavenly Father's kingdom.&nbsp; As one who gets to tell your story on a daily basis, I say thank you for remembering (as your parents always told you) who you are.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago, I received a phone call from an elderly couple who had a desire to make a philanthropic contribution to BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; He in his 90s and she in her 80s, were a little leery of making the two-hour drive into Rexburg and asked if someone from our office could come visit them.&nbsp; I agreed to meet them at their home the following week.&nbsp; On the day that I drove to their home, I thought about what this visit would be like.&nbsp; We receive various kinds of gifts for BYU-Idaho, and we deal with people in all different situations in life.&nbsp; We even encourage faculty, staff and students to participate at whatever level they feel comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The key is just to participate.&nbsp; (By the way, you can all consider yourselves solicited now, so when our callers call you can say, well, Chris has already asked.) Sometimes it's as simple as a personal check.&nbsp; Often it's more complicated.&nbsp; Would today's visit with this couple bring a gift of cash, or perhaps a piece of their farm in the way of land, equipment, or livestock?&nbsp; Maybe they wanted to discuss various ways they could include BYU-Idaho in their will.&nbsp; Whatever it was, as you know, I was ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After a long drive and a few wrong turns, I finally found my way to their home.&nbsp; I pulled into the driveway, parked my car, and made my way to the door.&nbsp; The man of the house met me at the door.&nbsp; In his outreached hand was an old, worn-out, over-sized coat.&nbsp; His greeting to me was simple, "Here, put this on."&nbsp; Then with a smile and a slap on the back, he continued, "We don't want you to get dirty, now do we? Follow me."&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I'm no stranger to hard work or dirt.&nbsp; But I was a little curious to see where he was taking me.&nbsp; Over the next several hours, we moved his washer and dryer.&nbsp; We moved the refrigerator.&nbsp; We worked in his garage and in his garden.&nbsp; We pulled weeds and pruned trees.&nbsp; We spend time in his living room, where he showed me books he had written, pictures of vegetables that he had entered in the county fair and won blue ribbons.&nbsp; He even showed me a couple of rugs hanging on his wall, that also were county fair, blue ribbon winners.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />During that time we talked about his life.&nbsp; I learned about a humble job, supplemented by a simple farm.&nbsp; I learned that he and his wife never had the opportunity to have children of their own, but welcomed into their home 26 foster children, several of which they would eventually adopt.&nbsp; No stranger to heartache or hard times, he talked about missions and his love for the gospel.&nbsp; The only time I saw the slightest bit of disappointment was when he talked about being recently released from a calling that he loved--that of Assistant Scout Master.&nbsp; In his words, "I just couldn't do the over-nighters anymore."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, after I'm sure he thought I had worked hard enough, we sat down with his wife at the kitchen table.&nbsp; He pulled out his checkbook and wrote what I would consider to be a very substantial check to the University.&nbsp; That alone would have been a great story to tell you.&nbsp; However, that is not the story I'm supposed to tell.&nbsp; As he was writing this check, all I could think about were the trials that this man and his wife had faced over the years, yet they seemed so happy, so willing to serve.&nbsp; In the end, I couldn't help but to ask him how he stayed so positive throughout his life.&nbsp; He gave me a priceless grin, looked at his wife, looked back at me and simply said, "Brother Chris, I choose joy."&nbsp;<br /><br />This life is about choices.&nbsp; The plan of salvation began with a choice, and you chose correctly.&nbsp; You chose to follow the Savior's plan to come to this mortal existence, where you would gain a body and be tested.&nbsp; You knew that not all days would be great, but that it was worth it.&nbsp; Having existed before we came to this life, we knew that it would be difficult to receive this imperfect body--a body that would challenge us, that would at times let us down and eventually decay and die.&nbsp; But that was okay, because that was part of the plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps in the pre-existence we even gave each other comfort and committed that when those mortal challenges of heartache, despair, disappointment, sin and guilt (to name a few) came upon us, we would go to our knees and thank our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; We would thank Him for trusting us enough to give us trials so that we could do our best to try to be like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />We knew that the natural man was an enemy to God and that we would have to fight natural man so that the body would not dictate to the spirit.&nbsp; Rather, we would fight to make sure that the spirit was in charge.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yet, we make mistakes.&nbsp; We recognize that often in life we get a little sidetracked--even with all our great intentions, with all the preparation and guides that we've had in our lives: the guides of the scriptures, of parents, of teachers and prophets, and good roommates.&nbsp; Even with all that, from time to time we lose our way, or just wander ever so little off the path.&nbsp; At those times, we pray for help.&nbsp; We try to remember the courage that we knew we'd have, we look for answers, and we look for hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the upper room, during the time of the last supper, I believe that the disciples knew that their Lord would soon be leaving them.&nbsp; I believe that the Savior could tell that they were hurting. He could tell that they were sad and that although they may not have understood everything, they knew a change was coming.&nbsp; I can't imagine what it must have felt like to know that you were walking with the Savior, being taught by the Savior, then come to the realization that He would soon be leaving you.&nbsp; It must have been devastating.&nbsp; I'm sure His disciples were full of heartache and despair.&nbsp;<br /><br />In that moment, the Savior demonstrated pure charity.&nbsp; He showed his love for his fellow man as He taught them about the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; "I will prayer to the Father," the Savior tells them.&nbsp; "And He shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever."&nbsp; Then, again I believe in an act of pure love and kindness, the Savior stated, "I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to you."&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar taught us that often one way that the Lord will come to us, or answer our prayers, or give us comfort is through those around us.&nbsp; These people will come through the tender mercies of the Lord.&nbsp; They will build us up, prompt us to think, and will give comfort.&nbsp; Often these experiences are simple and quiet, yet quite powerful.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me give you an example.&nbsp; About four years ago, I had such an experience.&nbsp; My lesson came late in the night one Saturday night from a very pure source.&nbsp; On that day, I was called to serve as the stake president of the Rexburg Idaho North Stake.&nbsp; In the morning, two stakes would come together to become three in a gathering so large it was moved to the Hart gym here on campus.&nbsp; I would be sustained and set apart as a stake president.&nbsp; As you can imagine, it was a fairly restless night.&nbsp; I tried to go to sleep that night, but it was useless.&nbsp; I got up and sat on the couch in my front room.&nbsp; I thought about what all this would mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Then came the questions.&nbsp; Why me?&nbsp; Did Heavenly Father really know what he was doing?&nbsp; Did he know what this was going to mean for me and my young family?&nbsp; I was sure I was not qualified to be a stake president; I was going to need to make some changes.&nbsp; Changes I wasn't sure I wanted to make.&nbsp; Nothing major of course, after all I was serving as a Bishop, but I could do much, much better.&nbsp; As a sat pondering all these changes, my then four-year-old daughter, noticing that the light was on, crawled out of bed, came into the front room, and sat on my lap.&nbsp; Wiping her eyes she gave me a look as if to say, "Well, I'm here, now what?"&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I began to explain my problem to her. "Hallie, Daddy's got a problem.&nbsp; You see I have to talk in church tomorrow to a lot of people, and I'm not sure what to say.&nbsp; But I want to sound smart and maybe just a little funny.&nbsp; I want to say something that they are going to remember, so what should I say?"&nbsp;<br /><br />(All good questions for a four year old at 1:00 in the morning.)&nbsp; She took my question seriously. &nbsp;She, too, pondered for a moment.&nbsp; She scratched her head, she thought hard, and then it came to her.&nbsp; She pointed at me with her little finger and said, "I know, I know, Dad. Tell them about Jesus."&nbsp; (Not a bad response).&nbsp; I didn't say anything, I just looked at her and thought, "You are one smart little girl. You must get that from me." (The whole humility thing hadn't quite set in yet.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Apparently, I wasn't convincing enough for her because she then took my face in her hands and said, "You know dad, He lived. Then He died. Then He lived again." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"That is right, sweetheart.&nbsp; That is right.&nbsp; We call that the Resurrection."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Oh," she replied, "I didn't know that."&nbsp; She nestled down in my lap and went back to sleep.&nbsp; As she dosed off, she again offered one more reminder, "Tell them, Dad. Tell them about Jesus."&nbsp;<br /><br />A simple reminder of the power of choices that we make and where true joy comes from.&nbsp; A reminder that if we want to find joy often we need to set our own concerns aside, and find our Savior.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sisters, may I take just a minute here to address you?&nbsp; I have three daughters.&nbsp; They are 5, 8, and 13.&nbsp; When I ask my five-year-old what she wants to be when she grows up, or even what she is today, &nbsp;&nbsp;without hesitation she proudly declares, "A princess."&nbsp; If I were to ask my eight-year-old the same question, I'm quite positive I would get a very similar response; however, there would be a bit of doubt in her eyes.&nbsp; She might even hesitate when she says it, wondering if she's really going to be a princess when she grows up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My thirteen-year-old is different.&nbsp; She is smart, talented, worthy--but something happens.&nbsp; Once you start your teenage years, something happens that I know continues well into adulthood and throughout your life.&nbsp; Satan happens.&nbsp; Self-doubt, self-consciousness and the pressures of this world all combine to mask our real selves and try to make you forget who you really are.&nbsp; It becomes a daily fight to remind my oldest daughter, you, and all the women in my life, that you are still princesses.&nbsp; Sisters, I testify that you are daughters of our Heavenly father.&nbsp; He loves you and you love Him.&nbsp; He is the Most High God, and as His daughter, you are a princess.&nbsp; Please never forget that.&nbsp; Please never stop acting like the princess that you are and will become.&nbsp; Not a princess as the world would define, but something much greater, a princess of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />From a four-year-old princess, "Tell them, Dad. Tell them about Jesus."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You will remember the Savior in 3 Nephi as He taught His people.&nbsp; He tells them to go home.&nbsp; He tells them to ponder upon these things that He has just taught them.&nbsp; Before He leaves He blesses them.&nbsp; He gathers them around him and asks, "Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Truly, isn't that all of us? Is there anyone in this great assembly hall today that does not have an affliction, a moment of self-doubt, a weakness or heartache or sin?&nbsp; The miracle and the comfort of this scripture is found in verse 9 in these simple words as we are told that, not only did He say that He would heal them, but "he did heal them, every one."&nbsp;<br /><br />So, too, He will heal you.&nbsp; After the Savior healed these people, He prayed with them.&nbsp; When He arose from His prayer and beheld the joy of the multitude, He wept as He declared, "My joy is full."&nbsp;<br /><br />Brother and Sisters, this joy can be ours, too.&nbsp; This joy will be found as we make correct decisions--as we make decisions to follow our Savior, and listen to that still small voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, with agency come consequences.&nbsp; Not all trials and tribulations come because Heavenly Father wishes to try us.&nbsp; Sometimes, our trials come because of our own foolish decisions and behaviors.&nbsp; It is in those times that we need to resist the temptation to blame or curse others, but to look at ourselves first and ask the hard questions.&nbsp;<br /><br />The disciples of the Savior gave us a great example of this.&nbsp; Again, we return to the scene of the last supper.&nbsp; The Savior informs His disciples that one of them will betray them.&nbsp; Their response according to Mathew has always intrigued me.&nbsp; Mathew 25:21 states, "Verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."&nbsp; The response from the disciples is recorded in the next verse, "And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Think about that response.&nbsp; Lord, is it I?&nbsp; Is that how you would respond?&nbsp; I know exactly how I would have responded.&nbsp; I would have been the first one to jump up and say, "Not me, Lord. In fact not only is it not me, but I'm pretty sure it's that one over there.&nbsp; Never really trusted him."&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, that's not what they said.&nbsp; Sometimes, it really is us.&nbsp; Then the question becomes, "Father, is it I? Father, what is it I need to change?&nbsp; Father, what is it I need to cast away, lay upon the alter, or fix, or repent of?"&nbsp; Sometimes, in order to have joy, we need to make changes about ourselves.&nbsp; Remember, not only did He say He was going to heal all those that were afflicted, but he did. &nbsp;Everyone.&nbsp; And he can heal you, too.&nbsp;<br /><br />When those times happen, we need to repent and repent immediately.&nbsp; If you have said something offensive or been offended, be quick to forgive.&nbsp; After all, if you haven't offended anyone in this church or been offended, you simply haven't lived long enough.&nbsp; So forgive, and allow yourself to be forgiven.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you need to go see your bishop, go see him.&nbsp; His doors are open to you.&nbsp; As one who has served as a bishop, I testify that we rejoice when you come.&nbsp; We know the burdens that will be lifted; we know the joy that will come into your life if you will simply act.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another favorite scripture of mine is found in Alma, Chapter 56.&nbsp; You know the story well.&nbsp; It's a story about a group of young men who decided to fight.&nbsp; It's a story about righteous parents who made a covenant to their Father in Heaven, and they would not deny that covenant.&nbsp; It's a story of another people who were humble enough to stand for their brethren and say, "We will fight for you."&nbsp; It's a story of the sacrifice of parents and the testimony of mothers shared with their sons.&nbsp; It's a great story!&nbsp;<br /><br />It is the story of Helaman.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Helaman, these young men take up arms to defend their land, their families, and their liberties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The part of the story that I would like to share with you today is the story of their battle by the city of Antiparah.&nbsp; This is found in chapters 56 and 57 of Alma in the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; As you will recall this small band of brethren led by Helaman were used as a decoy.&nbsp; It was their job to march past the city of Antiparah, which at the time was a Lamanite strong hold, housing the strongest army of the Lamanites, in hopes to lure the Lamanites out of the city.</p>
<p>After a few days, the Lamanites stopped their pursuit of Helaman and his sons.&nbsp; The scriptures tell us that Helaman didn't know for sure if Antipus had caught the Lamanites and a battle had begun, or if the Lamanities in the cunning ways had simply stopped pursing Helaman and his warriors in hopes of luring them into a trap.&nbsp; Either way, Helaman had a choice to make.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he going to continue his march away from the Lamanites-away from danger, away from heartache and despair?&nbsp; Or, was he going to turn and face the advisory head on?&nbsp; Although the leader of this group, Helaman knew it was not his decision to make, so he turned to his sons and asked this very simple question, "Therefore, what say ye my sons, will ye go against them to battle?"&nbsp; With one accord, these young yet courageous men exclaimed, "Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth."&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, every day when you rise from your beds and face this battle we call our mortal existence, you make a choice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Will today be the day that the adversary convinces you to lower, ever so slightly, your personal honor.&nbsp; Perhaps it's a blouse that is not really that immodest.&nbsp; Or flip-flops or shorts, or some other clothing that doesn't fit in the dress code, only to justify ourselves by saying, "Oh, I'm just walking across campus, it doesn't hurt anyone."&nbsp; Maybe it's the day you take a double take at that girl that always wears that blouse that's really not that immodest, or an extra click of a mouse that takes you to a site to you may say isn't really pornography, or that song or movie that has just a few bad words, but other than that it's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Or is today that day that you exclaim to your Father in Heaven, "Father, I choose joy. Today I will go to this battle.&nbsp; I know it won't be easy.&nbsp; I pray for help. I pray for messengers and for the Comforter to come in all its many ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Today is the day that I will choose to fight.&nbsp; Today, I will stand for Truth and Righteousness; I will be an honorable priesthood bearer.&nbsp; I will be a disciple leader.&nbsp; Behold Father, I know you are with me, so I will go forth and you will not let me fall.&nbsp; Today, I choose joy!"<br /><br />About two years ago, I received another call from that same elderly couple I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; They had moved to Idaho Falls to a nursing home.&nbsp; For the first time, the Brother seems a little anxious.&nbsp; There was a concern in his voice.&nbsp; He wanted to meet as soon as possible.&nbsp; When we arrived at their home, we quickly sat down and he quizzed us thoroughly.&nbsp; Would we promise them that his wife would be protected?&nbsp; Had he done enough to take care of her?&nbsp; Would we help oversee their funds to make sure that she would have enough?&nbsp; We assured him that he had been frugal and smart, that she would be fine.&nbsp; We promised that we would come and sit and talk, that we would always be there.&nbsp; When we were done, he didn't have to say it.&nbsp; But I'm sure I heard it.&nbsp; I'm certain he whispered, "Chris, my joy is full."&nbsp;<br /><br />Two days later, he passed away.&nbsp; He fought his fight, and he chose joy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, it is my prayer that we will join in this fight together, that we join our Heavenly Father in accomplishing his greatest desire--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&nbsp; That fight is worth fighting for.&nbsp; You fight for that, and you will have joy.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Tell them, Dad. Tell them about Jesus."&nbsp; He lives!&nbsp; And because He lives I will choose joy, and I will have joy.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Bio not available</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a signal honor to be invited to address such an impressive body of young Latter-day Saints, to stand face to face with so many who, like me, have embraced the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ because of the truth that God has spoken to our hearts.<br /><br />In the short time I have with you, I want to explain what I mean by that phrase, "the truth that God has spoken to our hearts." I would like to explore something of what faith means, and touch on the important balance of faith and reason. I want to discuss the issue of doubt, how we should view it and how we might deal with it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am confident that most of you were born in the Church or have grown up in the Church from an early age. There are also represented in this audience some with very different experiences, including those who first learned of the Church through missionaries or friends. Some of you, no doubt, grew up in homes that lacked the support of at least one active parent, possibly both.&nbsp; Whatever your circumstances, whether or not you were "born in the covenant," all of us at some point have to decide for ourselves what we believe and how that belief is going to help shape and guide our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a believing heart, you have a great gift. Paul told the Corinthians that there are many different gifts of the spirit, and he acknowledged that wisdom, knowledge and faith are all different gifts.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; Since faith is a prerequisite to so much of what we do in the Church and in our lives, it surely is a great blessing to have the kind of faith that brings peace of mind and surety of purpose.&nbsp;<br /><br />But what of those who don't have that gift. Is it wrong to ask questions? Is it wrong even to have doubts?&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to take you back to that never-to-be-forgotten Sunday when Jesus Christ showed himself to his most trusted followers as the first person ever to be resurrected to immortality. Remember the circumstances? Despite the many warnings and predictions that Jesus had made to his disciples about his coming sacrificial death, the apostles--two days after the crucifixion of their beloved Lord and Master--were still numb with shock, disoriented, uncertain what to do and most certainly in dread fear for their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Into that frightened assembly and behind closed doors stepped the resurrected Lord, appearing suddenly in the midst of them. We can scarcely imagine their joy and wonder as he showed them the scars in his hands, feet and side.&nbsp;<br /><br />But the record of John tells us that one of the apostles was missing. Thomas Didymus was somewhere else. What a meeting to miss!&nbsp; When later they told him, no doubt exultantly, that they had seen the Lord, he could only react with a kind of defiant skepticism:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The gospel narrative tells us that it was more than a week later when the apostles were again assembled; this time Thomas was with them. The scriptures are silent on whatever conversations might have taken place between Thomas and the other ten during that tense week.&nbsp; I can't believe that they would not have discussed the resurrected Lord. Nevertheless, after eight days they are again assembled, again behind closed doors, and the Lord appears for a second time. Seemingly perfectly aware of Thomas's earlier reaction, Jesus wastes no time in addressing Thomas directly:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And then follows this powerfully provocative statement: "Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;they that have not seen, and&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;have believed."<sup>&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What does that mean, exactly?&nbsp; Jesus is not discounting the validity of those who see signs and miracles and believe. But he seems to place on a higher elevation those who believe&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;those tangible evidences.&nbsp;<br /><br />This gets right at the heart of how we balance reason--based on our physical senses and external evidence--with faith, which Alma tells us specifically is the evidence of things&nbsp;<em>not seen</em>, which are true.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Or, as I said earlier, the truth that God speaks to our heart.&nbsp; Faith requires us to stretch a little, beyond our comfort zone.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's dig a little deeper into the scriptures.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's night, early hours of the morning, sometime between 3 a.m. and dawn. There is a storm raging on the Sea of Galilee, and the apostles are in a ship, being mercilessly tossed about in the dark. Suddenly, in the dim gloom they see a figure out on the water, and we can easily understand the intensity of their fear in that moment. They cry out in what I suppose was close to panic, but then the calming and familiar voice of Jesus comes across the waves: "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />What exactly motivated Peter at that moment we can only guess, but right then nothing seemed more important to him than being with his beloved Master. "Lord," he calls out. "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus obliged with one word. "Come."&nbsp; And then Peter, defying all logic, not to mention gravity, against all reason and contrary to his entire life's experience as a fisherman, steps into that wind-whipped sea and actually walks.&nbsp; For a few moments--and I can imagine his eyes riveted on the Savior--he is carried by pure faith. And then it's almost as if he suddenly asks himself, "What on earth was I thinking!"&nbsp;<br /><br />"When he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />How interesting! Here is Peter, who has just done what no ordinary man in recorded history has ever done, but he falls just short--just another particle of faith. If he had stretched just a little bit more, perhaps the outcome would have been different.&nbsp;<br /><br />But what of the other apostles in the ship? They exercised their reason--they saw with their eyes, heard with their ears. And they concluded from this tangible evidence, "Of a truth thou art the Son of God."&nbsp;<br /><br />With whom would the Lord have been most pleased at that moment?&nbsp; Peter, motivated by faith, or the others, with their reliance on the evidence of their physical senses?&nbsp; Like Thomas, the others believed because they saw. Peter acted --and succeeded for a moment--because of what his heart told him.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Boyd K. Packer has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Faith, to be faith, must center around something that is not known. Faith, to be faith, must go beyond that for which there is confirming evidence. Faith, to be faith, must go into the unknown. Faith, to be faith, must walk to the edge of the light, and then a few steps into the darkness. If everything has to be known, if everything has to be explained, if everything has to be certified, then there is no need for faith. Indeed, there is no room for it.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Is it reasonable for us to ask, why? What is this thing called faith that is not a perfect knowledge, but that we are expected to act upon with all the surety and confidence as if derived from tangible evidence?&nbsp;<br /><br />Faith is so much more than mere belief or assent. &nbsp;Faith stretches us. It forces us to reach beyond our senses, and in that reaching we develop spiritual strength and greater trust in the Lord. As James tells us, &nbsp;"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; I repeat: faith, therefore, is more than belief. Faith is an active force, not a passive condition. I suspect that one reason why we have to develop it here on earth is because of the expectations that will be placed on us when we are in the next sphere. I offer this only as personal opinion, but the Lord has promised that those who are faithful will inherit all that the Father has. In the eternities to come, will those who create worlds do so because they have learned the laws of physics that govern the universe, or will they work through the exercise of perfect faith, or a combination of both?&nbsp; How much reaching and stretching will it take? We don't know, but when Jesus says that by faith we can move mountains, is he merely being figurative or is there something about the power of faith that we now only dimly perceive, but that we must learn while here on earth?&nbsp;<br /><br />It seems to me that Jesus often stretched those whom he encountered. You are familiar with the incident in which a man approaches Jesus and pleads on behalf of his son. The father paints a touching picture of a young man who, since childhood, has had fits, foams at the mouth and sometimes was driven to extremities of casting himself into fire or the sea. The father's plea, "Have compassion on&nbsp;<em>us"&nbsp;</em>--plural--reminds us of the tender feelings of every parent who has anguished for a sick child.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus was about to stretch this man.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Jesus said unto him,&nbsp;<em>If thou canst believe</em>, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />There it is again. "Help thou mine unbelief." He believes, he is so close, but he recognizes he is short of perfect faith and he pleads with Jesus to help him make up that deficiency.&nbsp;<br /><br />"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose."&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I think, perhaps, that this father was stronger after this incident in which his son was healed, partly because he reached deep into his own soul and drew upon every ounce of faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />What incidents in your life have stretched you like this? &nbsp;Is there something that seems just out of your reach that a little extra faith could deliver the hoped-for blessing?&nbsp;<br /><br />May I share with you an incident from my own life that I have never shared publicly, but which I think illustrates a point? Many years ago when I was living in Australia, I received a call one Saturday afternoon from a young mother for whom I was the home teacher. Her little son, about two years old as I recall, had found his way under the kitchen sink, and she thought he had swallowed some cleanser or fluid or something he shouldn't have. She wasn't sure, but she was in a highly distressed state, as was the child. She asked if the home teachers could come quickly and give the child a blessing. Without transport, she had not even thought about a hospital. Within a few minutes, I had collected my home teaching companion and we were in her home.&nbsp; It became immediately apparent that giving a blessing in the normal way was going to be very difficult. The child was writhing and screaming in his mother's arms so focusing and concentrating on the blessing and placing our hands reverently on the little boy's head seemed out of the question. As my companion unscrewed the cap from the consecrated oil, I knew suddenly what I had to do, and consciously pushing all doubt from my mind I placed my hands on the struggling child and said just one word: "Sleep."&nbsp; Immediately the child's cries stopped, and as he slept soundly in his mother's arms we proceeded with the blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I had never had such an experience before, and although I have given many blessings I have never had one like it since. It is many years since this incident, and whether the child was truly sick or just reacting in panic to his mother's acute distress no longer matters. But I do know one thing: In that moment of need we were stretched to exercise perfect faith, and we couldn't afford to doubt.&nbsp; That is what I remember, and that is what I took away from that experience. Sometimes the Lord puts us in circumstances where we have to reach beyond what seem to be our natural limitations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moroni tells us to "dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp; And he adds: "For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until after their faith."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;Faith really does precede the miracle.&nbsp;<br /><br />The biggest obstacle to this kind of faith is doubt. We might define doubt as the antithesis of faith.&nbsp; It denotes uncertainty, hesitation and lack of confidence, especially when it comes to decision-making. In earlier English usage the word also conveyed a sense of fear.&nbsp;<br /><br />In referring to doubt, I do not mean to include the absence of answers to legitimate questions. By doubt I refer to a disbelieving heart.&nbsp; A questioning attitude when accompanied by cynicism is an enemy to God and will prevent the spirit from bearing witness.&nbsp; But having unanswered questions about gospel topics or Church history is not the same thing at all.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would be disappointed if I felt my own children or grandchildren felt they could never ask questions.&nbsp; Questioning, probing, searching and exploring when accompanied by an attitude of personal growth and spiritual enrichment is not only one of the joys in life, it is absolutely essential to our continued progression.&nbsp; God has given us brains to use. Not using them is no better than the servant who, in the parable of Jesus, hid his talent in the earth.&nbsp; If you have questions, embrace them, not with a doubting heart, but with a thirst for knowledge. Then go to the sources where both reason and revelation can work together. A religious truth will never be in contradiction with a scientific truth. If they appear to be so, it's because we are lacking information on one side or the other, or both.&nbsp; And if a question can't be resolved immediately, don't worry. Time has a habit of solving lots of questions.&nbsp;<br /><br />My own experience as a convert at the age of nineteen might be helpful, here, in understanding how faith and reason sometimes compete, and sometimes can work together.&nbsp; I had first learned of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through my sister, who had been found by missionaries and had joined the Church. She was ten years older than me, and in quite a different place, spiritually. She had always been something of a seeker, but at last she had found what she was looking for.&nbsp;<br /><br />For me, it was quite different. In the British high school I attended, my closest friend and I were known as the class atheists. I was quite familiar with the Bible -- in fact, in the English education system at that time we not only had a devotional assembly every morning, but scripture knowledge was a required subject.&nbsp; I passed the scripture exam quite easily because I simply memorized scripture passages and knew the answers to the questions--not because I believed in God.&nbsp;<br /><br />So when my sister began to share her religious convictions with me I wasn't greatly impressed.&nbsp; Like all good Mormons, however, she didn't give up.&nbsp; Eventually I found her religious views to be so provocative I determined to learn enough about this new religion to set her right.&nbsp;<br /><br />That process took a few years, and ended differently than I expected.&nbsp; I began to be a frequent attender at the great city library in Liverpool, an impressive and imposing building where I discovered, as I recall, some 33 books about Mormonism or with extracts about the subject.&nbsp; Only two of them were favorable to the Church. I read everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And I learned a lot of facts. I quickly found that most of the anti-Mormon literature was written by members of other faiths whose distortion of Latter-day Saint history and doctrine was so palpably obvious, that it drove me to seek out more LDS literature where I could at least see for myself what Mormons believed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, gradually, something began to happen. As I worked through the pages of the Book of Mormon, went back to the New Testament and associated with Latter-day Saints, I found my natural cynicism to be in retreat, and I began to think of things more objectively.&nbsp; Whereas before, I read passages of scripture like any textbook, I now began to&nbsp;<em>feel&nbsp;</em>something. You will recognize what I could not at that time--that the Spirit was beginning to work on me. Very unscientific, but true, nonetheless.&nbsp;<br /><br />Toward the end of 1967 I had progressed enough, read enough, had enough time with missionaries and members that it had become all-important to me to know for myself whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, the key to which appeared to be the Book of Mormon.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moroni 10:4! How many members around the world have arrived at that scripture, exactly as I did, and come face to face with those remarkable verses that call for faith in Christ and real intent as preliminaries to a witness from the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />I had prayed about this for weeks--yes, I had got that far since my atheist days at school--and one evening alone in my room I was wrestling for that testimony after fasting for far longer than was wise.&nbsp; I was nearing the end of my prayer. My mind began to settle on whether I was willing to be baptized. Had I learned enough? Could I say that the Church was true?&nbsp; And although not in these words the question I was asking myself was, "Should I stretch?" Should I take what I had and embrace the gospel even though it meant a few steps into the unknown. The answer, I concluded, was, yes, I could. And it was in that moment of decision that the witness came. "Ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith." I understand that scripture now with perfect clarity. The Lord could have answered my prayers weeks earlier and saved me a lot of anxiety. But he cares enough about us to stretch us, to push us beyond where we would otherwise go.&nbsp;<br /><br />People come into the Church in many different ways. Some have a believing heart and need no convincing. Some, stubborn and proud like the teenage me, require something more. There is no one way, no single prescribed way.&nbsp; But what a difference attitude makes.&nbsp; Like my schoolboy peers, I stood in those morning assemblies for six years, sang the hymns and heard the scripture readings. But I remained completely unmoved by any of it.&nbsp; Yet today, there are times in a sacrament meeting when I drill down deep into the words of some of those same hymns and savor the music and I literally feel the tears running down my cheeks. I read the words of the four gospels or the Book of Acts and they seem to me to be so far above and beyond what I once failed to recognize. This is not just great literature, it is life changing, lifesaving eternal truth.&nbsp; Such is the difference that attitude makes. Such is the difference that comes from asking questions with real intent. Such is the different when the Spirit is present.&nbsp;<br /><br />Did I have all my questions answered, that night when I received that witness? Not at all. As a matter of fact, there were two big questions with which I had greatly wrestled and which the missionaries had not been able to answer satisfactorily. Neither could I find answers in Church literature. And yet, though those questions had once seemed like great, insurmountable stumbling blocks, now they seemed of far less consequence.&nbsp; Since I could not resolve them, I decided to put them on the shelf for some future resolution. In time, one of those troubling questions settled itself--in June 1978 when the priesthood was extended to men of all races. The second one, you may be interested to know, is something I am still working out, 45 years later. But I'm getting close!&nbsp;<br /><br />What I'm telling you is that questions are healthy if asked with "real intent," which to me means with honesty and sincerity of purpose rather than in a challenging or cynical "I dare-you-to-prove-it-to-me" kind of way, which is characteristic of so much anti-Church literature, and which sadly sometimes snares even faithful Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; I'm also telling you that we are not expected to have every answer to every question handed to us--that faith, in fact, requires that we don't have such an easy time, as President Packer taught us, if we are ever to grow.&nbsp;<br /><br />One last thought.&nbsp; I have found in my life that there is great joy when we always look ahead. There is a scripture that has always impressed me: "And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_05_Otterson.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Why would I ever want to look back to a time when I had no knowledge of some of the great questions of life? I cannot imagine what it would be like without the knowledge that I have gained from the gospel in a lifetime's pursuit. Why do we exist? Why did God create us? What is heaven and hell?&nbsp; Why is there suffering? What is our eternal destiny? Is it a mere continuation of consciousness, or some kind of permanent rest, as some teach? Or is God, Our Father, capable of imagining and delivering for us something far, far grander?&nbsp; The gospel provides me with persuasive, marvelous answers.&nbsp;<br /><br />If I did not have the gospel in my life, how would I explain away volumes of scriptural prophecies, such as the amazingly precise writings of Isaiah 700 years before Christ?&nbsp; How would I explain the traditions the Jews have kept alive for thousands of years if the Passover and Exodus never happened?&nbsp; How could I dismiss the detailed accounts of multiple witnesses in the New Testament and thereby relegate Jesus of Nazareth to the status of a local carpenter with a flair for itinerant preaching? How could I ignore the legion of stories and accounts of healing the sick, raising the dead, and the entire concept of the Atonement? How could I account for the personal testimonies, spiritual conversions and life experience of countless millions of Christian people from the time of the Savior to today?&nbsp;<br /><br />Without the gospel and my sense of accountability to God, would I lose my moral anchor, and be content to decide right and wrong from each circumstance, subject to shifting conventions of political correctness?&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you, but no, that path holds no promise for me. There will be no looking back. I intend, with God's grace and blessing, to stay committed to the truth that God has spoken to my heart. I hope to continue to stretch my faith at the same time I use my reason and intellect to explore new horizons. I believe the Lord promises us joy in this life and untold possibilities in the next for those willing to stretch, and who reach into the unknown with faith and confidence.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God is anxiously waiting for the chance to answer your prayers and fulfill your dreams, just as He always has. But He can't if you don't pray, and He can't if you don't dream. In short, He can't if you don't believe.</p>
<p>May we believe. May we develop faith. May we pray and work and stretch and dream and seek answers to the right questions.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I have grown older and hopefully wiser I have learned many things about myself such as what my strengths are and what my weaknesses are. One of the most surprising things that I have learned about myself is that I am extraordinarily ordinary.<br /><br />Let me explain by sharing some data with you. The engineer in me would prefer the data to be proven statistically valid, however, I feel they are close enough to illustrate my point regarding the extent of my claim to be extraordinarily ordinary, so I will forego validation in the pursuit of practical application. The average or ordinary US male is 5 feet 10.2 inches tall, weighs 160 lbs. and has a shoe size of 10 and a half. Check. The average American says he is in good health, eats at least two snacks a day, owns a computer, a cell phone, and has used the Internet today. Check as well. The average American owns at least one pet, is married, has two or more children and recycles. Check. By the age of 40 the average man experiences some hair loss. Definitely check. The average male is far-sighted.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;Again check, and I could continue, but this should suffice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although I am extraordinarily ordinary, my Heavenly Father has given me extraordinary blessings, including a testimony of Joseph Smith as a prophet of God and the restorer of His true church. May I remind you that no matter how ordinary or extraordinary you may think you are, this knowledge is available to you as well. For the Lord has said, "...all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Furthermore, we have these words from Nephi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price. Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I believe that one of the important elements of a testimony is to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that through him the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored, and that he translated the Book of Mormon through the gift and power of God. President George Q. Cannon in his biography on the Prophet Joseph stated, "We declare unto all to whom these words shall come that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God...this holy revelation is the gift, exclusively, to no man and no class of men. It is free to all who will seek for it in obedience and sincere humility."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February of 1992, a symposium on Joseph Smith was held at Brigham Young University. President Gordon B. Hinckley, then First Counselor in the First Presidency gave the keynote address at the symposium. His address was titled, "As One Who Loves the Prophet." For my remarks today I would like to borrow his title and speak, being one who is extraordinarily ordinary, as another who also loves the Prophet Joseph Smith. I have followed the promise given in Doctrine and Covenants 4:7, "Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you," desiring to come to know Brother Joseph and to gain a testimony that he is a Prophet of the living God; and I truly have received and it has been opened up unto me to receive this knowledge.&nbsp;<br /><br />Volumes have been written about this most remarkable man, and his name is truly, "had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn5" target="_self">[5]</a>&nbsp;Time will only permit me to discuss a few select reasons why I love this astounding man. My prayers have been in your behalf that through our time together today you will come to know Brother Joseph better, your interest in seeking to know more about him will increase, and most importantly, your testimony of Joseph Smith as a Prophet of God will be strengthened.&nbsp;<br /><br />I find that the more I study and try to come to know Brother Joseph better, the more amazed I become. Here is a man who was mayor of one of the most populous cities in the state of Illinois. He founded a university. He was Lieutenant General, the chief commanding and reviewing officer of the Nauvoo Legion with an estimated 5000 members. He was a candidate for President of the United States.&nbsp; He published a book that has exceeded 150 million printed copies. He founded a worldwide church that now numbers over 14 million members. He established one of the largest women's organizations in the world. He was said to have been subject to at least forty-six criminal cases, but was never found guilty in any of them. He accomplished all of this and much, much more eventually suffering a martyr's fate all before the age of forty! Joseph is indeed a very extraordinary individual.&nbsp;<br /><br />Truman G. Madsen summed up this same idea more eloquently than I could. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A feeling constantly recurs as one studies the life of Joseph Smith. You never quite get to the bottom. There is always more. You can be so impressed and overcome with glimpses that you say, 'Nothing good that I could learn of him would be surprising.' And then you become surprised. There is always more. It takes deep to comprehend deep, and I often wonder if any of us have the depth to fully comprehend this man.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;As illustrations and reasons why I love the Prophet Joseph Smith, I have selected several events from his life. I have chosen, where possible, to use the direct statements from the individuals involved rather than make a weak attempt to paraphrase or summarize these events in order to preserve the feelings and sentiments of the direct participants.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the Prophet Joseph because of his great capacity to forgive others, especially those that had grievously wronged him and caused him great suffering. Of this characteristic B. H. Roberts wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Prophet's frank forgiveness of his erring brother...exhibits a broad-mindedness and generosity that can come only from a great soul, influenced by the spirit of charity enjoined upon his disciples by the teachings of the Son of God. One of the surest evidences of Joseph Smith's greatness of mind and of the inspiration of God upon him is to be seen in his treatment of those who had fallen but were willing to and did repent of their sins.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup></p>
<p>One such individual was William Wines Phelps. You may recognize this name from our church hymnal. W. W. Phelps, as he is commonly known, wrote many of our popular hymns including, "The Spirit of God", "Now Let us Rejoice",<em>&nbsp;</em>and "Praise to the Man." In 1838, he became disaffected with the church and turned against Joseph. He signed an affidavit that was instrumental in Joseph's eventual imprisonment in Liberty Jail. After suffering spiritual and temporal reversals, W. W. Phelps wrote a letter to Joseph seeking forgiveness desiring to be reunited with the church. The magnitude of Joseph's character is shown in his response:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is true, that we have suffered much in consequence of your behavior - the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us...had it been an enemy, we could have borne it. However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord...Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship and rejoice over the returning prodigal.</p>
<p>Joseph closed the letter with the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, For friends at first, are friends again at last.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>I stand in awe of the Christ-like love and charity that were required by Joseph in this particular instance and so many others.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the Prophet Joseph because he possessed the childlike qualities of humility and submissiveness. These qualities are manifest in the events associated with the loss of the 116 pages of manuscript translated from the first part of the Book of Mormon. Recall that in Section 3 of the Doctrine and Covenants Joseph was strongly rebuked by the Lord. In my life, when I have made mistakes I have tried to correct them as best I could, learn from them and move on hoping that time will dull both my memory and the memories of others regarding my faults. Yet, in this section we have recorded the Lord's dealing with Joseph for generations now and in the future to read. I must admit that I do not possess the strength of character that must have been required by Joseph to have his mistakes, "spoken upon the housetops."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; Listen to these words directed to Joseph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And behold, how oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men. For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words-Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble...For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director to be trampled upon from the beginning.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that Joseph did repent, that his gift was restored, and that he was still chosen and again called to the work.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn11" target="_self">[11]</a>&nbsp;I love him and thank him for being humble and penitent.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor him for his phenomenal capacity to show courage over and over in so very many difficult circumstances in which he found himself. It was his nature to always come to the defense of his friends even if that meant putting himself in the way of danger. One little known event, as told by President John Taylor, serves as an additional example of this courageous man.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am reminded of a circumstance that occurred in Missouri, which I will mention to show the kind of feeling that Joseph Smith was possessed of. Some 25 years ago, in Far West, a mob - one of those semi-occasional occurrences - had come against us with evil intent, placing themselves in position to give us battle; and there were not more than about 200 of us in the place. We had one fellow who was taken with a fit of trembling in the knees, and he ordered our people to retreat. As soon as Joseph heard this sound, he exclaimed, "Retreat! where in the name of God shall we retreat to?" He then led us out to the prairie facing the mob and placed us in position; and the first thing we knew a flag of truce was seen coming towards us...Joseph Smith, our leader, then sent word back by this messenger, said he, "Tell your general to withdraw his troops or I will send them to hell." I thought that was a pretty bold stand to take as we only numbered about 200 to their 3,500; but they thought we were more numerous than we really were; it may be that our numbers were magnified in their eyes; but they took the hint and left; and we were not sorry.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn12" target="_self">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Courageous? Indeed!&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the Prophet Joseph because he possessed and expressed tremendous faith in Jesus Christ. An example of this faith comes from the Joseph Smith--History where he discusses the visitation of the prophet Moroni. He states in verse 29 that as he prayed for forgiveness and a manifestation of his current state that he, "had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one." Equally impressive to me is Joseph's ability to exhibit that same level of faith in seemingly inconsequential events. Consider the following: John Lyman Smith the brother of President George Albert Smith related this incident that took place when he was a young boy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In my early years I used to often eat at the table with Joseph the Prophet. At one time he was called to dinner. I being at play in the room with his son Joseph, he called us to him, and we stood one each side of him. After he had looked over the table he said, 'Lord, we thank thee for this Johnny Cake, and ask Thee to send us something better. Amen.' The corn bread was cut and I received a piece from his hand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Before the bread was all eaten, a man came to the door and asked if the Prophet Joseph was home. Joseph replied he was, whereupon the visitor said, 'I have brought you some flour and a ham.' Joseph arose and took the gift, and blessed the man in the name of the Lord. Turning to his wife, Emma, he said, 'I knew the Lord would answer my prayer.'&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>As another example of his complete faith and trust Joseph stated, "The Lord once told me that what I asked for I should have. I have been afraid to ask God to kill my enemies, lest some of them should, peradventure, repent."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I love Brother Joseph because he was an honorable man. Sarah M. Pomeroy tells of a time when she was a young girl and the Prophet came to the home of her family trying to raise money to pay the lawyer fees to defend his friend Porter Rockwell. She states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph requested my father to lend him $100.00 to pay the lawyer who defended Porter Rockwell. He explained the situation, and father freely counted out the money. 'This shall be returned in three days, if I am alive,' said the Prophet, and departed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My aunt, father's sister, who was camped with us, was quite wrathy, and called my father very foolish and unwise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Don't you know Thomas,' said she, 'you will never see a cent of that money again. Here are your family without a home, and you throw your money away.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Don't worry Katie,' father replied, 'if he cannot pay it, he is welcome to it.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This conversation was held before us children, and I thought seriously about it. Would he pay it, or would he not? But I had strong faith that he would.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The day came when it was to be paid. A cold, wet, rainy day. The day passed. Night came; 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, and we all retired for the night. Shortly after there was a knock at the door. Father arose and went to it, and there in the driving rain stood the Prophet Joseph.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Here, Brother Thomas, is the money.' A light was struck, and seated at the table, he counted out the $100.00 in gold.He said, 'Brother Thomas, I have been trying all day to raise this sum, for my honor was at stake. God bless you.'...My testimony is that Joseph Smith was truly a Prophet of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the Prophet Joseph because he personified charity and kindness in all aspects of his life. Stories abound of the kind acts performed by him which included rescuing little children stuck in the mud, giving his walking cane to an elderly friend whom he encountered walking down the street, taking in complete strangers and feeding and caring for them, casting bundles of debt obligations, owed by many of the saints who had been driven from Missouri, into the stove to burn them and forgive them, feeding and housing thousands sometimes at the expense of leaving no room or food for his own family, and countless other kind acts that were never recorded. This story as told by Mary Frost Adams provides an additional example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While he was acting as mayor of the city, a colored man called Anthony was arrested for selling liquor on Sunday, contrary to law. He pleaded that the reason he had done so was that he might raise the money to purchase the freedom of a dear child held as a slave in a Southern State. He had been able to purchase the liberty of himself and wife and now wished to bring his little child to their new home. Joseph said, 'I am sorry, Anthony, the law must be observed, and we will have to impose a fine.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The next day Brother Joseph presented Anthony with a fine horse, directing him to sell it, and use the money obtained for the purchase of the child.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p>I love and admire the prophet for his ability to maintain a positive outlook amidst trials, tribulation, and persecution. In the early fall of 1842, Joseph was forced into hiding in order to avoid his enemies that were trying to seize him and carry him back to Missouri. Before leaving Nauvoo he wrote a letter to the saints, which has now become section 127 in the Doctrine and Covenants. In verse 2, Joseph provides us a glimpse into his feelings;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life...But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation...for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>
<p>Five days later, while still in hiding and staying at the house of Edward Hunter he wrote another letter to the saints, which was to become section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Among other items of instruction and counsel he wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceeding glad. Let the earth break forth into singing.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a></sup></p>
<p>He is said to have told his cousin George A. Smith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Never be discouraged, if I were sunk in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia, with the Rocky Mountains piled on me, I would hang on, exercise faith, and keep up good courage, and I would come out on top.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn18" target="_self">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, of himself he stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women - all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty, who will give me dominion over all and every one of them.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn19" target="_self">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Another reason I love the Prophet Joseph is because the Lord loves him. Listen to these tender words recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants where the Lord refers to the Prophet Joseph as His son:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say unto you&nbsp;<em>my son</em>, thy sins are forgiven thee, according to thy petition, for thy prayers and the prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn20" target="_self">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Also speaking of Joseph the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For I am the Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world and through all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father... Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest demonstration of this love came while the Prophet was a prisoner in Liberty Jail where the Lord responded to his plea, "O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;with the comfort that comes only from a God, "<em>My son</em>, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;Additionally, the Lord told Joseph, "...thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn24" target="_self">24</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After recounting trials and tribulations that Joseph had suffered or might be called upon to suffer, the Lord provided loving counsel and reassurance with these words, "know thou,&nbsp;<em>my son</em>, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. Therefore, hold on thy way...Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn25" target="_self"><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the Prophet for being "willing to submit to all things,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;as he demonstrated in laying down his life alongside his brother Hyrum at Carthage. Six days before heading for Carthage and a martyrs fate, Joseph stood in full uniform and addressed his beloved Nauvoo Legion, his "boys" as he called them, from the frame of a building for the last time. He told the Legion:&nbsp;<br /><br />I do not regard my own life. I am ready to be offered a sacrifice for this people; for what can our enemies do? Only kill the body, and their power is at an end...God has tried you. You are a good people; therefore I love you with all my heart. Greater love hath no man than that he should lay down his life for his friends. You have stood by me in the hour of trouble, and I am willing to sacrifice my life for your preservation.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn27" target="_self"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />And so he did, sealing his testimony with his blood. In section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants Elder John Taylor wrote:&nbsp;<br /><br />Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world... They lived for glory; they died for glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down to posterity as gems for the sanctified.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn28" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord himself validated this statement in the revelation given to Brigham Young at Winter Quarters, approximately two and a half years after the martyrdom, which is now found in section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In this revelation the Lord told the church and the world that Joseph's death was not the just recompense of a fallen prophet, but rather, the righteous completion of a divinely appointed mission. The Lord said, speaking of Joseph:&nbsp;<br /><br />Whom I did call upon by mine angels, my ministering servants, and by mine own voice out of the heavens, to bring forth my work; Which foundation he did lay,&nbsp;<em>and was faithful; and I took him to myself.&nbsp;</em>Many have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and the wicked might be condemned.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn29" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />While I love and admire the Prophet for the qualities he possessed and his strength of character, I love him all the more for the things he did in his role as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor him because through him we have knowledge of the true nature of God, for he saw God the Father and His son Jesus Christ in the Sacred Grove.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor the Prophet Joseph because through him we know that we can be redeemed through the atonement of Jesus Christ and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn30" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor the Prophet Joseph because through him we have the Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph's words that "... a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn31" target="_self"><sup>31</sup></a>&nbsp;have been fulfilled in my life. I love the Book of Mormon and I know it to be true.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor the Prophet Joseph because through him we have answers for the age-old questions: Where did we come from? What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? We have a true understanding of the great plan of happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor the Prophet Joseph because through him the keys of the Priesthood of God have been restored to the earth never to be taken away again.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love and honor the Prophet Joseph because through him the sealing power was restored to bind families together forever. How very grateful I am to be sealed to my sweetheart Stacy and our four beautiful children. This is one of the singular blessings in my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />We do not worship Joseph Smith; we worship God our Eternal Father and His son Jesus Christ. However, we revere and honor him for fulfilling his divinely appointed mission as a dispensation head.&nbsp;<br /><br />I close with these words from Parley P. Pratt that he wrote as a declaration published in the March 1845 edition of the&nbsp;<em>Millenial Star&nbsp;</em>speaking of Joseph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He has organized the kingdom of God. - We will extend its dominion.<br />He has restored the fullness of the gospel. - We will spread it abroad.<br />He has laid the foundation of Nauvoo. - We will build it up.<br />He has laid the foundation of the Temple. - We will bring up the top-stone with shouting.<br />He has kindled a fire. - We will fan the flame.<br />He has kindled up the dawn of a day of glory. - We will bring it to its meridian splendour.<br />He was a "little one," and became a thousand. We are a small one, and will become a strong nation.<br />In short, he quarried the stone from the mountain; we will cause it to become a great mountain and fill the whole earth.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn32" target="_self">32</a></sup></p>
<p>I add my witness that Joseph Smith was the Lord's prophet and seer chosen to restore the keys of the kingdom and the true gospel of Jesus Christ in this, the final dispensation. I am grateful that this knowledge is freely available to all, including the extraordinarily ordinary, and I am grateful to be counted, with you, as one of the millions that, "shall know Brother Joseph again."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_12_Roach.htm#_edn33" target="_self">33</a></sup><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters and friends, I am grateful to participate with you in this weekly campus devotional. I express appreciation to our Heavenly Father for this wonderful and meaningful assignment. My fellow General Authorities always return from Rexburg enthused and uplifted from being in your presence. They often comment on how capable you are and how spiritually prepared you seem as you attend these sessions. You are wonderful examples of righteous believers. I pray that in the short time we have together, the Spirit of the Lord will fill our hearts and minds and teach us things that cannot be learned from any other source or by any other means.<br /><br />We are also grateful for the vision and direction being given to this unique university by President and Sister Clark. I am sure you have benefited in many ways by their inspired leadership and influence, as well as from those who preceded them. BYU-Idaho is fulfilling a singular role in the Church, developing approaches to teaching and learning that are being emulated in many other settings, including in the new youth curriculum and in the missionary effort worldwide.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am sure that many who have had opportunity to address you have included in their comments personal counsel and suggestions from their own experience. Although you might find a bit of counsel in my remarks, my desire is to teach pure and simple doctrine and allow you to discover for yourselves how to apply these truths in your own lives. I have chosen to use as my overarching theme today a passage found in the New Testament writings of Paul. This scripture speaks directly to you and me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others. ... For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My message today focuses on the spiritual significance of embracing the light--of living our lives in such a way that we are filled with light, even as the world seems to be drifting more and more into darkness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago, Sister Christensen and I returned home from our weekly date night to find our teenage children watching a video they had rented from the local video store. To let you know how many years ago this really was, the video they rented was in VHS format, which today would be considered an ancient artifact. Anyway, as we walked into our family room and sat down to be with our children, Sister Christensen started to feel uncomfortable with what they were watching. It wasn't necessarily the content; it was the feeling she had while watching the video. After a few minutes, she asked our children if they saw "light" in this particular movie. She was not referring to the cinematography, or even the elements of the plot, but to the feelings she was experiencing when exposed to something rather dark and somewhat eerie.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the years, we have adopted, as part of our regular family dialog, that simple, penetrating question, "Do you see any light in that?" We ask this question frequently as we seek after things that are virtuous, lovely, of good report or praiseworthy;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;or as we are bombarded with worldly influences, or darkness, that seem to be constantly looming. Simply by being on guard and by using this somewhat obvious filter, we have learned that it is quite easy to differentiate between what is light and what it dark-between things that inspire us and bring us closer to the Spirit and things that do not.&nbsp;<br /><br />The doctrine of "light" is the very essence of the gospel, which is centered in Jesus Christ and His Atonement. To understand "light" means to understand the nature and divine character of the Savior Himself. He unequivocally declared, "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;To be "children of the light," as Paul taught, means to believe and have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and to follow His righteous example.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon prophet Abinadi explained that Jesus Christ "is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;This light is in each of us, and it helps us discern between good and evil. It is called the Light of Christ, which the prophet Mormon said "is given to every man, that he may know good from evil," and that "every thing which inviteth [us] to do good, and to persuade [us] to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the most profound sections on the doctrine of light in all of scripture, the Savior said, "I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world; ... I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;So when we talk about light, we are really talking about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider, for a few minutes, what we learn about light, and about darkness, from the experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the sacred grove. You know this history well; as I read a few verses, I invite you to ponder the effects of both light and darkness:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desire of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was&nbsp;<em>seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me</em>, and had such an astonishing influence over me as&nbsp;<em>to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.</em>&nbsp;Thick&nbsp;<em>darkness</em>&nbsp;gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were&nbsp;<em>doomed to sudden destruction.&nbsp;</em>But, exerting all my power to call upon God to deliver me out of&nbsp;<em>the power of this enemy which had seized upon me,</em>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<em>I saw a pillar of light</em>&nbsp;exactly over my head, above the&nbsp;<em>brightness of the sun,</em>&nbsp;which descended gradually until it fell upon me.... When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages,&nbsp;<em>whose brightness and glory defy all description,</em>&nbsp;standing above me in the air. One of them spoke unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup></p>
<p>From Joseph's experience, we learn that the concept of light is much broader and much deeper than a simple description of luminosity or radiance--and that darkness is more than the mere absence of light. What Joseph witnessed was a battle between two forces, the ongoing conflict between the powers of heaven and the powers of evil. As Joseph described what he saw, he used terms such as "brightness" and "power" and "glory." To understand the doctrine of light, we need to understand the depths of this spiritual power, which comes from the Savior Himself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Again from Doctrine and Covenants section 93, we read a very familiar verse: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;Here the Savior equates light with "intelligence" and "the glory of God." In a similar verse we read, "The word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Those of you who are studying mathematics will recognize in these two verses the mathematical principle of equality. Those of you who are not studying mathematics, stay with me--it's not as complicated as the mathematicians make it sound. The principle of equality states that if we know A equals B, and B equals C, and C equals D, then we also know that A equals D. Now, apply this logic to the scriptures we just read: If intelligence equals light, and light equals truth, and truth equals spirit, then intelligence must equal spirit. In fact, all of these terms could be considered interchangeable, and in many cases can be substituted for one another elsewhere in the scriptures. Let me illustrate with a few examples to help deepen our understanding:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whatever principle of&nbsp;<em>intelligence</em>&nbsp;[substitute one of the other words--<em>glory, truth, light, spirit</em>] we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and&nbsp;<em>intelligence</em>&nbsp;[again, substitute one of the terms&nbsp;<em>glory, truth, light, spirit</em>]<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn10" target="_self">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Or, in a different example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the&nbsp;<em>light [spirit, glory, intelligence, truth]<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>which shineth, which giveth you&nbsp;<em>light &nbsp;[spirit, glory, intelligence, truth],<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same&nbsp;<em>light [spirit, glory, intelligence, truth]</em>&nbsp;that quicken your understandings; Which&nbsp;<em>light [spirit, glory, intelligence, truth]<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>proceedeth from the presence of God to fill the entire immensity of space.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Doctrinally, since "light" proceeds from the presence of God and is synonymous with the Spirit of the Lord, it is that same Spirit that enlightens and quickens us. It is the Light of Christ, or Spirit of Christ, that "giveth light to every man that cometh into the world."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;It is the Spirit of Christ that is "the light that is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;As you and I follow the Savior and embrace the light, we become His children, Children of the Light, His sons and His daughters. As we continue on this path, we learn and grow, and gain even more light. Listen to this verse from the Doctrine and Covenants, "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light growth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, we have been given the light of the gospel through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. You and I know what God expects from us, His beloved children. We have His Spirit to guide and direct us. To become "children of the light" means to reject the power of the adversary and to choose daily to follow in His light.&nbsp;<br /><br />The phrase "children of the light" describes a people in whom the light of the gospel shines brightly. It describes a people who seek the light and are drawn to that which is virtuous, clean, and pure. There is an expectation that children of the light are alert and watchful, not "sleeping," in a spiritual sense, when they should be "awake." Children of the light do not sit passively in darkness; they have the courage to stand up and stand out. When the adversary comes looming, children of the light know when to fight back, when to say no, and when to simply walk away.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught: "Jesus cautioned that Satan desires to sift us like wheat, which means to make us common like all those around us. But Jesus taught that we who follow Him should be precious and unique, 'the salt of the earth' and 'the light of the world,' to shine forth to all men." Elder Oaks continues: "We do not serve our Savior well if we fear man more than God. He rebuked some leaders in His restored Church for seeking the praise of the world and for having their minds on the things of the earth more than on the things of the Lord. Those chastisements remind us that we are called to establish the Lord's standards, not to follow the world's. Elder John A. Widtsoe declared, 'We cannot walk as other men, or talk as other men, or do as other men, for we have a different destiny, obligation, and responsibility placed upon us, and we must fit ourselves [to that higher standard].'"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Children of the light let their light shine, that others may see their good works, and glorify our Father in heaven.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;They "arise and shine forth, that [their] light may be a standard for the nations."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;What does it mean to be a standard to the nations? A standard is a model used in comparative analyses. If we let our light shine, our friends in the world (who have the Light of Christ) will measure their light against what they see in us.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior said to Nicodemus: "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;As you let your light shine, others who are sensitive to the light will be inspired by you to seek greater light. They will want to have more of what they see in you.&nbsp;<br /><br />To be filled with light means more than simply obeying the commandments; it means to "live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;including following the teachings of His chosen prophets. This is a defining characteristic of those whom Abinadi called Christ's "seed." As he bore powerful testimony of the Savior's Atonement in the court of the wicked king Noah, Abinadi declared, "Whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord-I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, ... these are his seed."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;Children of the light exercise great faith as they listen to and follow the words of the prophets.&nbsp;<br /><br />And what is our living prophet saying to us today? In the past few sessions of general conference, President Thomas S. Monson has given several powerful and closely related messages on topics such as "Stand in Holy Places," "Dare to Stand Alone," and "See Others as They May Become." In these messages, he is inviting us to strengthen our commitment to live the gospel, and to reach out, rescue, and strengthen those around us.&nbsp; He has taught that in order to be strong in a world that has moved so far from that which is spiritual we must develop strong testimonies.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;He has promised that "absolutely nothing in this world ... will provide more comfort and happiness than a testimony of the truth."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn22" target="_self">22</a>&nbsp;</sup>And he has pleaded with us to consider the "countless individuals who have little or no testimony right now, those who could and would receive such a testimony if we would be willing to make the effort to share ours and to help them change."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;As children of the light, we heed this counsel from a prophet of God and share our light with those around us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, there may be times when we consider all that is expected of children of the light, and believe it to be beyond our reach and abilities. Painfully aware of our own shortcomings, we may wonder why anyone would look to us for light and inspiration--particularly when we are in need of such help ourselves. If you ever feel this way, remember that your Heavenly Father knows all about you--your strengths and your weaknesses. He knows perfectly who you are, but He also knows who you can become. And with all of that knowledge, He has placed you here, now--at the exact time and place where you can do the most good with the talents and gifts He has blessed you with.&nbsp;<br /><br />You don't have to wait until you are perfect before you can be a light to the world. Becoming children of the light is a process, much like the process of conversion, which Elder Dallin H. Oaks described as "a profound change of nature." That's why we have the gospel of Jesus Christ, he explained, to help us "become what children of God are supposed to become. This spotless and perfected state will result from a steady succession of right choices, and from continuing repentance. ... Now is the time for each of us to work toward our personal conversion, toward becoming what our Heavenly Father desires us to become."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn24" target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Because becoming children of the light is a continual, lifelong process, it seems imperative that we prayerfully and consistently evaluate how we are progressing. Perhaps we should consider asking ourselves some of the penetrating questions found in Alma chapter 5. For example, Alma asked:&nbsp;</p>
<p>To become "children of the light" we must be born of God, constantly repent, and continually deepen our conversion by daily applying the Atonement in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />God has placed you on earth at a very important time in the history of mankind. He knows your talents and the spiritual gifts He has given you. He knows how you will contribute to bringing about much righteousness. There are many warnings in the scriptures about the perils of the last days--so many that they can make us feel anxious. But while Satan will unleash his forces, the last days are not his hour of triumph--they belong to the Lord. The increase of evil in the world only means there will be an even greater increase in righteousness. As Satan tries to inflict his pain and distractions, God is hastening His holy work--steadily and surely bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It seems to me that rather than focusing on how evil in the world seems to be growing, we should focus on how good is increasing exponentially, all around us. We have a recent example of how our prophet has done just that. In a brief, five-minute statement at the beginning of the last general conference, President Monson shifted our perspective and our focus, hastening the effort to promote righteousness. How did he do this? Simply by announcing a change to the minimum age for full-time missionary service.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn27" target="_self"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;It has been inspiring to see how members of the Church around the world have caught the spirit of missionary work in response to the prophet's words. We now seem to be increasing our attack on the evils in the world with an ever-growing, valiant army of faithful missionaries, consecrated men and women dedicated to combating evil and saving more of Heavenly Father's precious children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brother Adrian Ochoa of the Young Men general presidency described the effort this way: "We are at war. And in this war, the best way to defend against evil is to actively promote righteousness. ... You cannot be passive when Satan seeks to destroy that which is wholesome and pure. Instead, stand up boldly for what you know is true! When you hear or see anything that violates the Lord's standards, remember who you are--a soldier in the army of God. There is no better weapon against the enemy, the father of lies, than the truth that will come out of your mouth. ... Most of your peers will respect you for your courage and your integrity. Some will not. But that doesn't matter. You will gain the respect and trust of Heavenly Father because you used His power to accomplish His purposes"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn28" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As children of the light, we have the obligation of making this world a holier and happier place for our having lived in it. Heavenly Father relies on our influence to help bring all of His children home to Him. We should become an influence for good wherever we go, "examples of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn29" target="_self">29</a>&nbsp;</sup>The Lord has blessed us with a bigger-than-life example of how this can be done. The life and ministry of President Thomas S. Monson shows how our righteousness will influence and bless those around us.&nbsp;<br /><br />I conclude with just one of many illustrative experiences from President Monson's life--one that he shared recently in general conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On one occasion many years ago, I was swimming laps at the [gym] when I felt the inspiration to go to the University Hospital to visit a good friend of mine who had lost the use of his lower limbs. ... I immediately left the pool, dressed, and was soon on my way to see this good man.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I arrived at his room, I found that it was empty. Upon inquiry I learned I would probably find him in the swimming pool area of the hospital, an area which was used for physical therapy. Such turned out to be the case. He had guided himself there in his wheelchair and was the only occupant of the room. He was on the far side of the pool, near the deep end. I called to him, and he maneuvered his wheelchair over to greet me. We had an enjoyable visit, and I accompanied him back to his hospital room, where I gave him a blessing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I learned later from my friend that he had been utterly despondent that day and had been contemplating taking his own life. He had prayed for relief but began to feel that his prayers had gone unanswered. He went to the pool with the thought that this would be a way to end his misery--by guiding his wheelchair into the deep end of the pool. I had arrived at a critical moment, in response to what I know was inspiration from on high.</p>
<p>As we reflect on that story, can we see, in our minds eye, the circumstance in which President Monson's friend found himself--in the darkness of a devastating trial, of discouragement, and despondency?&nbsp; Can we also see how President Monson, valiantly cultivated the light in his own life by heeding the promptings of the Holy Ghost?&nbsp; Day by day he became a "child of light," until he could do as the Savior asks each of us to do:&nbsp; "Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which ye have seen me do."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn30" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp; The light that President Monson holds up, the light of our Savior, continues to bless and guide this world, even as it blessed his friend.&nbsp; President Monson concluded:&nbsp;<br /><br />My friend was able to live many more years--years filled with happiness and&nbsp;<a href="http://lds.org/topic/gratitude/" target="_self">gratitude</a>. How pleased I am to have been an instrument in the Lord's hands on that critical day at the swimming pool.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn31" target="_self"><sup>31</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I do not know what you will be called upon to do in the months and years ahead. But the Lord knows. He knows where each of you, His faithful servants, will be needed most. As you cultivate His light by following the promptings of His Spirit, He will use you as instruments to bring about much righteousness. So be worthy, be listening, and never postpone a spiritual prompting. Continually ask yourselves the question our family asks, "Do you see any light in that?" Be vigilant in seeking for and following the true light of the gospel, which is the Savior Himself, and you will receive more light, becoming brighter and brighter every day.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear witness that Jesus Christ is "the Light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth; [and that He is] the life of men and the light of men."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_19_Christensen.htm#_edn32" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp;I testify that we are the "children of the light," His sons and daughters. I know that the Savior loves us and will continually bless us with more light as we exercise faith in Him and follow His perfect example. Yes, the powers of the adversary are strong in the world today, but our collective influence, as true disciples of the living Savior, is even stronger. May we continually let our lights so shine, or better said, let His light which is in us shine, is my deepest desire, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>When I was a young boy, I felt the best parts of the scriptures were the stories involving action, danger, adventure, and courage. I have since learned to enjoy the less action-oriented passages of scripture but I still very much appreciate the examples of strength and courage found in the scriptures.<br /><br />There are some great, unforgettable scenes that immediately come to mind:&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember Daniel, who was cast into the lion's den for standing by his beliefs? I love that story. Daniel has so much faith in God that he is willing to face hungry lions rather than betray what he believes in. I wanted to be that kind of person.&nbsp;<br /><br />David, a young shepherd, facing down a nine-foot-tall giant warrior when no one else would--with just a simple sling, a few stones, and his faith in God.&nbsp; David shouts with courage, "I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts,<em>&nbsp;</em>the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied!"<em>&nbsp;</em>The chills still run down my neck.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ammon, a faithful missionary to the Lamanite people, stands alone in defending the king's flocks against a band of vicious marauders. And, yes, I did think the severing of the bandits' arms was a cool part of the story when I was a child--and I kind of still do. But what an example of courage Ammon was to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Abinadi, realizing that speaking the truth to King Noah will lead to a painful death, continues to testify of Christ until the flames consume his body and he cries out, "God will execute vengeance upon those who destroy his people" and then "O God, receive my soul." The scriptures say that Abinadi "sealed the truth of his words by his death." Abinadi was an unflinching witness of Jesus Christ under the most painful and extreme circumstances. Would I ever be willing to do something like that?&nbsp;<br /><br />Who can forget the bravery of Samuel the Lamanite, standing atop the city wall preaching the gospel of Christ to those who should have known better? I've never had to teach the missionary discussions with arrows flying around my body, but I am certain this wasn't very comfortable. And yet Samuel continued to teach the people even at the potential peril of his own life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Prophet Joseph, imprisoned and bound in chains, stands majestically and rebukes the evil-speaking guards: "Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit. In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and bear such language. Cease such talk or you or I die this instant!" Wow. I could only imagine having such courage.&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember thinking as a young boy, "I wish I could be like these men someday. I wish I had their great strength, courage, and conviction." I had absolutely no idea how someone would gain such things and it was difficult at the time to see myself ever having these virtues because I was a somewhat anxious child. When I was in first grade, I was afraid to play kickball with the other kids because I feared I might make a mistake and everyone would laugh at me. So I timidly stayed on the sidelines and just watched the game each day. My mother learned about this and explained to me that, if I just had the courage to try, she knew I would be able to succeed. Those words of encouragement, and the promise of a substantial cash bribe, convinced me to give it a shot. As you can imagine, I quickly learned that my mother was right. Having the faith and courage to act, to try, to do something difficult rather than sit on the sidelines of life was an important lesson that I have never forgotten and have needed to revisit when facing things much more terrifying than a kickball game.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures are literally filled with examples of courage. Why? Why in the last days would we need so many examples of faith and courage? The scriptures describe our day as a time "when men's hearts shall fail them." We face "goliaths" that the ancient saints and those of Joseph Smith's time couldn't imagine. President Gordon B. Hinckley explained:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are Goliaths all around us, hulking giants with evil intent to destroy. These are not nine-foot-tall men, but they are people and institutions that control attractive but evil things that may challenge and weaken and destroy us. Included in these are beer and other liquors and tobacco. Those who market these products would like to enslave you into their use. There are illegal drugs of various kinds which, I am told, are relatively easy to obtain. For those who peddle them this is a multibillion-dollar industry, a giant web of evil.There is&nbsp;pornography, seductive and interesting and inviting. It has become a giant industry, producing magazines, films, and other materials. It is available on the Internet and, if you allow, it will intrude into your home via your television. It is designed to take your money and lead you toward activities that utterly destroy.</p>
<p>President Hinckley continues:</p>
<p>The giants who are behind these efforts are formidable and skillful. They have gained vast experience in the war they are carrying on. They would like to ensnare you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is almost impossible to entirely avoid exposure to their products. You see these materials on all sides. But you need not fear if you have the slingshot of truth in your hands. You have been counseled and taught and advised. You have the stones of virtue and honor and integrity to use against these enemies who would like to conquer you. When they challenge you, you can hit them "between the eyes," to use a figurative expression. You can triumph over them by disciplining yourself to avoid them. You can say to the whole lot of them as David said to Goliath, "Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_03_26_Nielson.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a like manner, President Boyd K. Packer recently warned:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These are days of great spiritual danger for this people. The world is spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell you that it will not get better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances. Nothing happened in Sodom and Gomorrah which exceeds the wickedness and depravity which surrounds us now.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we clearly have some significant challenges ahead of us. However, we also have an unprecedented opportunity to prove ourselves by standing courageously for what is right in the face of evil, just as our heroes in the scriptures did. I am convinced that the Lord doesn't want a passive people.&nbsp; He wants us to appropriately stand up for the things we believe and to be good examples, even in the face of resistance and ridicule. We need to be humble, but people should not wonder where we stand on important moral issues.&nbsp;<br /><br />I always realized that this life was a test. That is what I was taught by my parents and in Primary. What I did not realize when I was younger is that this life isn't just a test it is&nbsp;<em>the ultimate personalized</em>&nbsp;<em>test</em>. It is designed to push on our weakest areas and, and at times,&nbsp;<em>tax even our personal strengths beyond their mortal capabilities and limits</em>. Yes, I believe we will all be tested beyond what we are personally capable of enduring on our own. But what about the scripture promising we "will not be given more trials than we can bear?" I have come to believe the true meaning of this verse is "you will not be given more trials than you can bear&nbsp;<em>with God's sustaining power holding you up</em>." True courage and strength doesn't just come from within,&nbsp;<em>it comes from God</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />No matter how wealthy we are, how smart we are, or how physically strong we are, we will face trials that will be too much for us to handle without God's help. We may believe we are ready for anything, but life will show us otherwise. It will "school" us. There is only one anchor we can rely on to pass our test--and it is not ourselves. We must totally rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ to see us through the trials of life. We cannot learn what we must learn, we cannot endure what we must endure, and we cannot become what we must become without Christ's loving guidance and sustaining support--made possible by His infinite Atonement. Faith in oneself is good but insufficient. The great secret behind the test of life is that it cannot be passed on our own. We either do it with Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost by our side&nbsp;<em>or we don't do it at all</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite the fact that the Holy Ghost will always be with us as we journey through life, there are some times when His companionship cannot be as easily felt. There are times the Spirit withdraws a bit, as it did with Christ himself, allowing us to face darkness and despair on our own for a time--so that we may learn.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in her poem entitled "Gethsemane," expressed it this way:</p>
<p>All those who journey, soon or late,<br />Must pass within the garden's gate;<br />Must kneel alone in darkness there,<br />And battle with some fierce despair.<br />God pity those who cannot say:<br />'Not mine but thine'; who only pray:<br />'Let this cup pass,' and cannot see<br />The purpose in Gethsemane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When Joseph Smith asked about the purpose of such devastating experiences in life, the Lord replied, "All these things shall give thee experience, and be for thy good." I will not pretend to understand why suffering seems to be the only way to learn certain things and to gain certain experience, attributes, and capabilities. Candidly, this is something I am still trying to understand for myself. However, I do have a firm testimony that it&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>necessary and&nbsp;<em>there sometimes is no other way to learn certain things</em>&nbsp;that have great celestial importance. As the Lord explained to Joseph: "Thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment. And then,&nbsp;if thou endure it well<em>,&nbsp;</em>God shall exalt thee on high."&nbsp;<br /><br />I married Shawna Lynch, an alumna of Ricks College, in 1992.&nbsp;<br /><br />We had four children together and adopted a child from North Carolina. Three of our five children were born significantly premature. We spent many long, harrowing weeks in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit watching our babies fight for their lives. They say, "there are no atheists in foxholes."&nbsp; Well, I can tell you there aren't many atheists in the NICU either.&nbsp;<br /><br />Constant prayers and priesthood blessings got us through that experience. During one particularly frightening moment, my daughter suffered a brain hemorrhage (which is relatively common among premature babies) and I gave her a priesthood blessing to stop the bleeding in her brain. I was terrified but much to my relief, the blessing worked and the bleeding stopped. I look back now, years later, and think to myself, "How did I survive those experiences?" It was so frightening and beyond anything I felt equipped to deal with on my own. The answer, of course, is that the Lord was sustaining me. I was so grateful that I was able to rely on His priesthood power when there was nothing more I could do to help the situation. I learned much from these trials--such as the need to depend more on God and how precious and fragile life can be.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Neil L. Andersen once stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These fiery trials are designed to make you stronger, but they have the potential to diminish or even destroy your trust in the Son of God and to weaken your resolve to keep your promises to Him. These trials are often camouflaged, making them difficult to identify. They take root in our weaknesses, our vulnerabilities, our sensitivities, or in those things that matter most to us. By definition, trials will be trying.</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you remain "steadfast and immovable"&nbsp;during a trial of faith? You immerse yourself in the very things that helped build your core of faith: you exercise faith in Christ, you pray, you ponder the scriptures, you repent, you keep the commandments, and you serve others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Like the intense fire that transforms iron into steel, as we remain faithful during the fiery trial of&nbsp;our&nbsp;faith, we are spiritually refined and strengthened.</p>
<p>One of my favorite movies is&nbsp;<em>Shadowlands</em>. It is the story of C.S. Lewis and what he learns from the loss of his wife, Joy, to cancer. As a Christian apologist, "Jack" as he was referred to, he would give lectures and speeches about the goodness and fairness of God.&nbsp; He would defend the idea that bad things sometimes happen to good people, and that this was consistent with the existence of a loving God. However, when his beloved wife was taken from him, Jack underwent a deep crisis of faith. It was no longer an academic issue for him. Jack had experienced true loss and his former arguments fell by the wayside. In one of my favorite scenes, Jack is talking to one of his friends about his experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jack: What's happening to me, Warnie. I can't see her anymore. I can't remember her face.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Warnie: I expect it is shock.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jack: I am so afraid of never seeing her again thinking that suffering is just suffering after all. No cause, no purpose, no pattern.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Warnie: I...I don't know what to tell you Jack.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jack: Nothing, there is nothing to say. I know that now. I've just come up against experience, Warnie. Experience is a brutal teacher but you learn. My [goodness] you learn.</p>
<p>Eventually, Jack comes to understand the importance of the extremely painful but necessary lessons he learns through the loss of his wife. The truths that Jack uncovers are that suffering is a&nbsp;<em>master teacher</em>&nbsp;and that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is the only true "balm in Gilead." He ends up with a&nbsp;<em>much deeper</em>&nbsp;appreciation for the purposes of God and spends the rest of his life sharing his testimony of these things with others.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would now like to share a brief video in which Elder Quentin L. Cook talks about the purpose of trials in our lives and how to deal with them.&nbsp;<br /><br />["Hope Ya Know, We Had a Hard Time" (3:24)]&nbsp;<br /><br />I love how Elder Cook focuses on serving others when we are feeling sorry for ourselves. I believe service to others who are suffering is one of the best remedies for self-pity and depression.&nbsp;<br /><br />The most devastating experience I personally have lived through was Shawna's death in 2005.&nbsp;<br /><br />Her passing was totally unexpected and a tremendous shock to myself and my kids. Overnight, I found myself a single father with five children. It was a surreal experience that changed me forever. This event took me to the "valley of the shadow of death." Even in the very depths of despair and depression, I found the Lord waiting for me in my personal Gethsemane--fully understanding, loving, compassionate, and willing to strengthen my feeble arms and knees. I had been through the worst thing I could possibly imagine--the loss of my spouse and the loss of my children's mother. But, despite the abject horror of the situation, the Holy Ghost told me everything would be okay and I believed Him. It was during this experience that I learned a very important lesson:&nbsp;<em>There is nothing to fear in this life if we are doing our best to live the principles of the gospel</em>. There is&nbsp;<em>nothing</em>&nbsp;to fear.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is possible to have personal peace during the most extreme, difficult, and trying of circumstances. The scriptures refer to this phenomenon as "peace that passeth all understanding." The world is simply not capable of understanding the concept of experiencing peace during such times--this is why it passes their understanding. They just don't get it because&nbsp;<em>it isn't logical</em>. The only people who can understand it are the followers of Jesus Christ who have experienced such peace during the most trying of times.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as I experienced such peace in my extremities, you can too. Such knowledge allows us to "fresh courage take" even if things don't seem particularly hopeful at the moment. I&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;that Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost will be there for each of us in our personal hour of need. True courage comes from trusting in the Lord&nbsp;<em>no matter what</em>&nbsp;we are presently going through. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf explains, "No matter how overshadowed you think you may be, your Heavenly Father has not forgotten you."&nbsp;<br /><br />You may have noticed the beautiful woman sitting by my side. Gratefully, I am no longer a single father.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord helped me find a very special woman who had been prepared to join our family and help us to heal from the loss we had experienced. Amy's arrival has been a "tender mercy" from the Lord for both my children and me and we are extremely grateful for her presence in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would now like to share with you a video where President Eyring speaks of the same things I am trying to share with you today.&nbsp;["Mountains to Climb" (5:06)]&nbsp;<br /><br />In preparing my thoughts, I remembered back to when I was your age in college. I had many questions, concerns, and uncertainties about my future:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I worried about these things long ago. However, with hindsight, I now realize that these were not the things I should have been worried about. These are things that I believe will ultimately take care of themselves if we are faithful. In due time, the Lord will help us to be able to answer such questions. He will open up paths of opportunity for us if we are faithful and attuned to the Spirit. The truth is that our path in life is unlikely to be whatever we think it will be today. The Lord has unique experiences in store for each of us--both joyful and heart-wrenching. There is no way to know what these will be.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, while we cannot have absolute stability, predictability, or certainty in this life, we can know that the Lord will guide us and be there with us throughout our journey. This knowledge can give us the courage and faith to press forward even though we can't see very far down our personal pathway to the future. We can also prepare for the future by building up a store of personal testimony and faith, just as Noah built the ark in anticipation of a rainy day. The one thing I can promise you is that, because earth is essentially a school,&nbsp;<em>you will have the learning experience of a lifetime--with both wonderful and difficult lessons</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we eventually get to meet our heroes from the scriptures on the other side of the veil--Daniel, David, Ammon, Abinadi, Samuel the Lamanite, and Joseph Smith--I believe we will be able to feel very comfortable in their presence because, like them, our courage and resolve will have been tested to the fullest. I hope all of us will be able to declare, like Paul, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith."&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. No matter what circumstances we may find ourselves in,&nbsp;<em>we truly have no reason to fear</em>. He will be with us, no matter what. If we do all that we can, the Lord will make up the difference and all will be well in the end. Of this I bear witness, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon my brothers and sisters. I want you to know what a privilege it is for me to be here with you today. I am also happy to have my family here with me to lend me support as they have done throughout my life. I love them all very much.<br /><br />I feel very blessed to work here at BYU-Idaho. I have the distinct honor of having my office here in this building and being involved with the production of devotionals every week. I am constantly aware of what a blessing it is for each of us to have a facility such as this on our campus. In previous years I was privileged to work with others in planning the design and implementation of the audio/visual aspect of this auditorium. Watching it transform from a large hole in the ground into a world-class broadcast facility and auditorium was the opportunity of a lifetime.&nbsp;<br /><br />Often I accompany speakers when they enter this auditorium for the very first time. As they stand in awe, I am again reminded what a marvelous facility it is, a facility that was built as a gathering place for you as students. It is a monument to the love, care, and confidence the brethren have for you. I testify to you that the Spirit of the Lord abides in this building. It is by this Spirit that you may learn, experience, and apply these eternal truths through the messages delivered here.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my role here in assisting speakers I have frequently found myself giving assurances to them; "Not to worry, everything will be just fine." I now find it a little different when I am called upon to speak. However, I have complete confidence that the sound, the lights, the video, and the teleprompter will work to perfection. We have an excellent team of professionals who along with talented and dedicated students make all of this possible. We couldn't do this without them. I know of their commitment and diligence and I publicly thank them for their devotion and hard work. I acknowledge my daily blessings from being a small part of this institution with the opportunity to work beside people who share values and work ethics and whose first mission is to help build testimonies. My life and the lives of my family members are being blessed because of my time spent here.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have chosen to speak to you today about discipleship. About becoming a true disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ. I find myself in complete accord with what was taught by Elder Neal A. Maxwell when he said, "There is no greater challenge and no greater source of joy--both proximate joy and ultimate joy--than found in the process of discipleship. This process brings its own joys and reassurances.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope you realize that becoming a true disciple is not a casual decision. Making the commitment to be a disciple of Christ is a lifelong process, and the pathway is not always easy. As His disciples we must strive to do what He would have us do and we need to serve our fellowmen as He would serve them. Many of the teachings we have had throughout our lives focus on what we need to do, such as reading the scriptures, saying our prayers, fulfilling our church assignments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as vital as what we do, however, is who we are. Living the gospel helps us become more like Christ. Our Savior has shown us the way. He has set the perfect example for each of us and invites, even commands us to follow Him. As we take upon ourselves His name, we will inevitably become more like him. We will develop Christlike attributes. These attributes are a gift from God. We should seek to develop these gifts as we strive to progress in the Kingdom of God. Becoming like Him and being one with Him is the very definition of true discipleship.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was in the first grade, just learning to read and write, I idolized my parents and wanted to be just like my father. It came to me one day that my brother, Dee, had my father's name as his middle name. This seemed completely unfair to me. I didn't have a middle name at all. Why did he get to "take on the name of my father" but I did not? In my young mind, having my father's name was the way I could become more like my father. I decided to remedy the situation. I started signing my name, "Judy Wayne Lynn."&nbsp;<br /><br />This innocent expression of love is worthy of emulation. Not perhaps in the same way, but as we grow in our love for our Heavenly Father we should desire to take upon ourselves His name. We could be identified as a true disciple by the way we live from day to day in a Christlike way.&nbsp;<br /><br />Have you ever wondered how you might be perceived by others? Would an observance of your everyday behavior and demeanor cause others to discern that you were a disciple of Christ? How may we give evidence of our discipleship in our daily lives and as students here at BYU-Idaho? President Dieter F. Uchtdorf stated, "When we have integrity and live consistently by our standards, people notice. When we radiate joy and happiness, they notice even more.&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone wants to be happy. When we members of the Church radiate the light of the gospel, people can see our happiness and sense the love of God filling and overflowing in our lives. They want to know why."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior said, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.34?lang=eng" target="_self">love</a>&nbsp;one to another."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />He further stated, "For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />When the Savior visited the American continent he asked His disciples, "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?" And then, answering His own question, He said, "Verily I say unto you, even as I am".<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Christ's life was an example of service. Service is the evidence we may give as his disciples. I love the counsel of King Benjamin, a beloved leader who spent his life serving his people and teaching them the correct path to follow. We remember how he gathered his people together to give them one last message before he bestowed the kingdom to his son, Mosiah. His people pitched their tents facing the temple, awaiting the message from their great leader. When more gathered than would fit within the walls of the temple, he caused a tower to be built so that his message could make it to as many people as possible. When even that wasn't sufficient, he had his words written down so that all could be blessed by his counsel.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Obviously he thought his message was of sufficient importance for every person. His inspired message is just as important to all of us today. One of my favorite scriptures was his declaration, "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;As we truly love our Savior and want to be a disciple, we need to find ways to give service. Such opportunities abound if we search for them. I am a witness that the opportunities for service are right here on this campus.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share an experience I had with a young girl, I'll call Julie. I hired her to work as a student employee in my department. She was sweet and kind and generous, but I was a concerned for her. She was barely out of high school and had very limited experience. She was a little insecure, which caused her to be quite shy and reserved. I had a lot of work I needed her to do and she needed to be confident enough to give qualified assistance to the faculty and students. I had a training ritual worked out, but it was a pretty steep learning curve. I gave her some training and hoped that she could catch on and become a contributing part of our team.&nbsp;<br /><br />It didn't take long until my marvelous student employees took her under their wing. They helped her gain confidence at work. They worked with her and praised the quality of her work. Not only that, they invited her to join them after work hours. She just blossomed! She became part of their social circle. She was no longer shy or insecure. All of a sudden she was the mentor and trainer. She was helping those that were new to feel comfortable in their abilities. She had an air of confidence about her and the people she served trusted her abilities. I remember the thrill I felt the day she came in and announced she was submitting her mission papers. She served an honorable mission. As we received letters and postcards from her while she was gone, it was evident that she had developed into a strong missionary. On her return, she became one of our lead students, training and guiding other employees. She has since graduated from BYU-Idaho and is working on her graduate degree.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know you're saying, so what? That story sounds like thousands of students that make their way through BYU-Idaho. But that's what makes it so wonderful. The students were showing their true discipleship through their everyday living. She wasn't befriended because it was a service project. She wasn't somebody's visiting teaching assignment. They treated her with love and kindness, because that is what they do. That is who they are. That is who&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>are. When we say that we are trying to be like Jesus, this is what we mean.&nbsp;<br /><br />A man once asked Jesus, "Which is the great commandment&nbsp;in the law?" Jesus replied: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Charity is "the pure love of Christ."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;It includes God's eternal love for all His children. We each need to seek to develop that kind of love. When you are filled with charity, you obey God's commandments and do all you can to serve others. As you strive to do righteous works, your love for all people will increase. You will come to feel a sincere concern for the happiness and well-being of other people. You will develop charity as you look for opportunities to share your talents and give of yourself.&nbsp;<br /><br />In a letter to the editor of the Upper Valley Standard Journal, dated November 3, 2012, a man named Ron Merchant, from Jackson, Mississippi, wrote about an experience he had while passing through the upper valley with his wife a few months earlier. His vehicle had broken down in Rexburg and this was his experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I walked into an auto parts house in Rexburg, Idaho, and while there a young man gave me a spoof by asking where I was from - obviously because of my Southern drawl.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The young man followed me outside, along with his girlfriend. He explained that he was a diesel mechanic and he would help me install the part.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Being a skeptical person (and especially skeptical of Mormons) I declined the offer. He assured me he would do it at no charge whatsoever. With that, all the negative flags shot straight upwards!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He then explained that he was a twenty-three year old student at the nearby Brigham Young University-Idaho. He had recently finished a two year tour as a missionary for his Church. He also said that his dad had taught him to help other people free of charge, since that was what religion was all about.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With that, I relented. And, sure enough, he adamantly refused any money at all. I finally convinced him to take a $20 bill and treat his girlfriend to a Coke.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As I rode down the road, I thought about the young man and the integrity of his religion.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great example of a true disciple of Christ. This young man has been taught correct principles, and now he is applying them in his life. The people you meet may not know the truths of your doctrine, but they can see the fruit of living the gospel in your eyes and in your countenance. Does the light of Christ shine in your eyes? How may you give evidence of your discipleship in your daily lives? You young men have the power of the priesthood--the power to act for God on the earth. You can access that power only through obedience and purity. That power will enable you to bless your family through generations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Young women, you will be the ones to set the example of womanhood and motherhood. Always continue to be virtuous, lovely, praiseworthy, and willing to stand as witnesses of God at all times. Set your standards high and never let them waver. You will set the tone in your home. Decide now to always make your home a heaven on earth, a refuge from the storms that rage outside in the world.There are countless simple ways to demonstrate your discipleship. I have observed many everyday behaviors by the students here on this campus who radiate the light of Christ. You have seen them, too:</p>
<p>I have had hundreds of wonderful student employees over the years and they have always been a great example to me in their generosity and their willingness to strive toward true discipleship. I remember during one snowy, cold Christmas season, a student named Lori came to me asking if I knew of anyone that needed some special attention. She and her home evening group wanted to find a family that they could give service to for Christmas. I didn't know anyone, personally, but I told her that I knew of a couple of housing units that might have someone in need. She contacted the manager of one apartment unit and was led to a single mother with a four-year old daughter who had been ill. They thought she might appreciate some special attention. Her group enthusiastically embraced the idea of creating and delivering the twelve days of Christmas for this small family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember the excitement they had as they tried to think of things that would be enjoyable for the daughter or helpful for the mother. She would come to work each day and relay how they did the night before. They tried to be sneaky in their deliveries so that they wouldn't get caught. I am sure you can envision them putting this all together. Now, they didn't know this young mother or the daughter. But their Christmas was much more joyful as they planned and plotted their gifts. They didn't spend a lot of money or do anything extravagant, but they were very thoughtful in making each day a fun experience for the family.&nbsp;<br /><br />As they left for the holidays they had a feeling of warmth just knowing that they could do this little thing--not thinking that it was that big of a deal. When they returned at the beginning of the New Year they were all saddened to learn that the little girl succumbed to cancer right after Christmas. When the home evening group decided to try to find someone to serve they had no way of knowing what an impact their small act would mean to this sweet little girl, or to her mother.&nbsp;<br /><br />In reality, we never know what an impact our actions will have on someone else's life. Each of us has an important role to play in the grand design of our Heavenly Father. We are his hands here on earth, the way that the lives of his beloved children can be blessed and uplifted. Each individual act of service shows our discipleship. I want each of you to think back over your life and remember the people who have taken the time to serve you. Think of your parents, grandparents, bishops, home teachers, school teachers, coaches, Young Women and priesthood leaders, friends, siblings, and many others. Why did they all give of their time and talents to help you? Do they even realize the impact they made in your life? Have you stopped to thank them for their influence? Do you realize the impact you have on those around you?&nbsp;<br /><br />We are all part of a great tapestry that only God can see. As we make a stitch each day it becomes part of His final product. We can be making beautiful progress, or maybe we are making a mistake that needs to be unpicked. But the truth is that we each have a role in that grand design. In D&amp;C 64:33 we read, "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great."&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Always be mindful that the Lord has great plans for each of you. He wants you to be truly happy and has given you many guides along the way. You are very blessed to have a living prophet who gives you clear direction when the world wants to lead you astray. Keep your hand on the iron rod and your eyes focused on the ultimate prize.&nbsp;<br /><br />I learned an important lesson about service after the birth of my second son, Derek. I had just come home from the hospital and the Relief Society called to tell me that they would be bringing in dinner for my family. That was a nice thing to do and I was appreciative of their thoughtfulness. That evening the doorbell rang and I was very surprised when I opened the door. There was my visiting teacher, Paula Sonderegger, with soup, bread, and homemade doughnuts.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now it isn't unusual for a visiting teacher to bring dinner, but Paula's family had been going through a very hard time. Her husband had recently been ill and they had a son that was facing treatment for a brain tumor. Yet here she was with dinner for my family. I responded to her that she shouldn't have done this for me when her need was much more than mine. Her response has stayed with me all these years and has been a great lesson in my life. She said that it was good for her family to reach out and serve others during their challenging time. They could forget their own worries for a little bit as they concentrated on others. Her husband, Ferron, even made the doughnuts for us. I gratefully accepted their gift of dinner, which was wonderful, but even more so I gratefully accepted the lesson on service. Over the years I have remembered this many times when it felt like I had too much on my plate to take the time to give service. But giving when it is a sacrifice is often the time that it means the most.</p>
<p>I know that as students here you are all very busy. With classes, work, church callings, dating, families, and homework you have very hectic lives. Sometimes you might be tempted to think that you should wait and give service when things aren't quite so complicated. After you graduate you will have much more time. Or when you get married you will have time to do your visiting or home teaching. When you are finished with this online course you will have more time in the evenings to volunteer to clean the BYU-Idaho Center. During your off-track you will have more time to go to the temple. Do you really believe that giving of yourself should wait until it is easy? Where is the sacrifice in that? By giving of yourself when you are busy you will be blessed. I know that is challenging, but we need to "be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God [will be] with thee whithersoever thou goest."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />But look around you, you are probably sitting next to the elders quorum president of your ward, or maybe the Relief Society president, or your Sunday School teacher, or the girl that goes and does baptisms for the dead every Wednesday morning. You likely have come with your ward on Tuesday evening to help clean this very auditorium. Your husband may be the very busy executive secretary for the bishop, or maybe a counselor in the young single adult ward. Your wife helps babysit so your friends can attend the temple. It might have been your ward that did the service project at the Nature Park. Were you the one that signed up for the Adopt-a-Grandparent program? I am sure I saw you taking cookies to your home evening brothers last week.&nbsp;<br /><br />And when the disciples had done this, Jesus said unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>President Spencer W. Kimball stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let us hold fast to the iron rod. The Savior urged us to put our hand to the plow without looking back. In that spirit we are being asked to have humility and a deep and abiding faith in the Lord and to move forward--trusting in him, refusing to be diverted from our course, either by the&nbsp;<em>ways</em>&nbsp;of the world or the&nbsp;<em>praise</em>&nbsp;of the world. I see that quality of readiness and devotion in our people today. There is so much yet to be done! let us, then, move forward; let us continue the journey with lengthened stride. The Lord will lead us along, and he will be in our midst and not forsake us.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I ask each of you to join together in our commitment to continue to love the gospel and grow in our quest to be true disciples of Jesus Christ. Let us continue to create a spirit among us that identifies each of us as true disciples. As we do, we have His promise, that "I will go before your face, I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_02_Steiner.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />As we remain close to our Savior and our fellowmen, being a warm a cheerful person, full of love, carrying the Spirit of the Lord with us in our everyday pursuits, we may be discerned as His disciples by the radiance of our countenances.<br /><br />Such radiance comes as a natural fruit of living the gospel and is an inevitable result of our discipleship. And thus may the world know that we are His disciples.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today on another great day at BYU-Idaho. I love you very much, and I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today.<br /><br />I want to speak to you about the Lord Jesus Christ and the divine call of Joseph Smith to be the prophet of the Restoration. For just a moment, I want each of you to hold in your minds this image of the First Vision. Here is the boy Joseph kneeling in the Sacred Grove speaking with God the Father and His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. This scene represents the founding moment of the Restoration. This profound and beautiful image portrays two things that each of us needs to know deep in our hearts.<br /><br />First, Jesus Christ is the Beloved, Living Son of the Living God. Like His Father, He is a glorious, resurrected being, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, Joseph Smith was called and chosen by the Lord to lead the dispensation of the fulness of times as the great prophet, seer, and revelator of the Restoration. Joseph was divinely called and divinely inspired. He was, in very fact, the prophet of the Lord.We worship Jesus as the Savior and Redeemer. He is the way, the truth, and the life.&nbsp;<br /><br />We honor Joseph as the prophet of the Restoration, as the head of the dispensation of the fulness of times. From that glorious moment in the Sacred Grove until his last breath, Joseph revealed the Living Christ and the fulness of His gospel to a world starved for the truth. Among all the great prophets who ever have lived on the earth, Joseph occupies a special place. In the words of the 135th section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.</p>
<p>I gained a testimony of the Prophet Joseph when I was a boy. In the summer of 1960 when I was eleven years old, President David O. McKay dedicated our ward chapel in Salt Lake City. I felt a compelling desire to be at that dedication. I went early and got a seat at the front of the chapel. When President McKay walked down the aisle and up onto the stand, I was a few feet from him. I remember his eyes, his bearing, and his voice. I listened to him speak, and I listened to him pray. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, I knew in my little boy heart that David O. McKay was the prophet of God. I also knew that there was an unbroken chain linking President McKay to Joseph Smith. My testimony of David O. McKay was a testimony of Joseph Smith and all the prophets in between. Since that day, every time we have sustained a new prophet, I have received that same witness: this is the prophet of God; he stands where Joseph stood.&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph's call to lead the dispensation of the fulness of times made him the instrument through whom the Lord would "<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/1?lang=eng" target="_self">gather</a>&nbsp;together in one&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/1?lang=eng" target="_self">all</a>&nbsp;things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;Through Joseph Smith, the Lord restored to the earth the fulness of His gospel, including the holy priesthood, sacred ordinances and covenants, and His true and living Church. He gave to Joseph new revelations and power to bring forth the Book of Mormon and other new scripture written by ancient prophets thus fulfilling a prophecy made by Joseph in Egypt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word. . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written . . . shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon testifies of the truth of the word of God in the Holy Bible and illuminates, clarifies, and deepens our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Bible and the Book of Mormon, together with the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, teach us the truth about Heavenly Father's plan of happiness and the way to salvation and eternal life through the Lord Jesus Christ. These scriptures, ancient and modern, come alive in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Through the Restoration we can know and understand in our hearts the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and we can live it and enjoy all of its blessings in the Lord's true and living Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />This was the work the Prophet Joseph was called to do. As Brigham Young said of Joseph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[H]e took heaven, figuratively speaking, and brought it down to earth; and he took the earth, brought it up, and opened up, in plainness and simplicity, the things of God; and that is the beauty of his mission.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I want to give you two examples of the way the Lord Jesus Christ worked through the Prophet Joseph to make it possible for the plain and simple truths of the gospel to come alive in the Church and in us. Both examples come from the fourth article of faith written by Joseph Smith in 1842:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, the Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I want to consider first the principles of faith in Jesus Christ and repentance; and second, the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Faith in Jesus Christ and Repentance</strong><br />Joseph taught that faith in Christ is a principle of action and power. Our faith is in the love, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. When we act with faith in the Savior to repent of our sins, we see through the eye of faith the glorious, resurrected, living Christ acting with His pure love and almighty power to forgive, heal, and strengthen us. He has that power because of His atoning sacrifice.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Atonement of Jesus Christ is at the heart of the Father's plan of salvation. Through His atoning sacrifice and His resurrection, Jesus overcame the consequences of sin and death. He brought to pass the resurrection of all mankind and opened the way to salvation and exaltation for all who act in faith to come unto Him with repentant hearts. Repentance--or the process through which Christ changes our lives and transforms our very nature--is a supernal gift from a loving Father and His Beloved Son.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>I love this passage of scripture. And I love the way the revelations of the Restoration both witness of its truth and deepen our understanding of what it means. The Book of Mormon makes clear that Christ's love was deeply expressed in His suffering for each one of us and in His gift of repentance and forgiveness. The Atonement of Christ is personal.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years before the birth of the Savior, Jacob wrote that Christ would "[suffer] the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Abinadi used the words of Isaiah to bear witness of the personal nature of the Atonement. Speaking of Christ, he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, . . . and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Isaiah and Abinadi testified that Jesus saw us individually as He suffered our pain and the effects of our sins in the Garden of Gethsemane.&nbsp;<br /><br />The personal nature of the Atonement extends to every aspect of our lives. Jesus chose to experience every temptation, every pain, every sorrow, every moment of despair, every weakness, every mistake, and every infirmity we suffer. He did this so He would know how to lift and strengthen us through His love and power. Alma taught of the depth of the Savior's love in these words:And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.&nbsp;<br /><br />And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Through Christ's mercy and grace, we may obtain forgiveness of sins and be clean and pure before Him. This is a miracle of His love. That redeeming love extends to everything else that stands in the way of our progress toward becoming more and more like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Atonement of Christ is infinite. The Lord taught the Prophet Joseph that Jesus "descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;The power of His Atonement extends to all of God's children, whether in mortality now or in the world of the spirits.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moreover, the power of Christ's infinite Atonement penetrates into, through, and beyond the darkest of sins, the deepest addiction, and the very most awful things in mortal life. Except for those who have known a fulness and then choose perdition, His love and His power can change and transform every heart, every mind, every soul, every child of God, no matter what they may have done, no matter how far they may have fallen from the light. If they will come unto Christ, repent of their sins, and keep His commandments, He will heal them and change them and make them His.&nbsp;<br /><br />These marvelous truths come alive in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is in the Lord's church that we have access to sacred ordinances and covenants administered through the authority and power of the Lord's priesthood. It is faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and obedience to those ordinances and covenants that open to us the fulness of the Savior's love, mercy, and grace.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is one example. When I served as a bishop, a woman who had recently moved into our ward came to see me. She told me she had been involved in a very serious sin in her previous ward. She had sought to change her life and obtain the Lord's forgiveness for a long time. In that meeting, and in every meeting I had with her, I could see in her countenance the pain and sorrow she felt for what she had done. As I worked with her and learned more of her faith and her diligence, the Lord made it very clear to me that He had forgiven her of her sins and changed her heart. She was clean and pure before Him. I called her in and told her what the Lord had told me. I will never forget what happened. She bowed her head and began to weep. After a few minutes, she raised her head. The transformation in her countenance was miraculous. I watched as the Spirit of the Lord descended upon her. Light streamed from her face. She was radiant.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Baptism and the Gift of the Holy Ghost</strong><br />Through this experience and many others, I know that faith in Jesus Christ and repentance are eternal principles that come alive in the Lord's true Church. The same is true of the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Jesus taught Nicodemus that baptism by water and the Spirit are essential to spiritual re-birth and salvation in the kingdom of God:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon witnesses of the importance and the truth of these ordinances and illuminates their central role in the plan of salvation. Nephi taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow . . . your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, . . . then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, . . . I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ. . . . if ye . . . endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn12" target="_self">12</a></sup></p>
<p>If we remain true to the covenants we make, baptism by immersion in water and the baptism of fire through the Holy Ghost bring us marvelous gifts and blessings in the Lord's Church. These blessings include a remission of sins, becoming a member of the Church, and the sanctifying and strengthening companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br />Baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost are not the end of one's spiritual journey; they are the gateway ordinances of salvation. The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph that enduring to the end involves qualifying for the oath and covenant of the priesthood and the ordinances and covenants of the temple, including eternal marriage. These ordinances and covenants were had anciently and have been restored in the Lord's true Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we receive all the ordinances of salvation and keep the associated covenants, we become heirs to the blessings of the holy priesthood, a place of gathering in Zion, and exaltation and eternal life in an eternal family. We also become heirs to all the sacred responsibilities, duties, and obligations of those ordinances and covenants, including the responsibility to build up the kingdom of God on the earth and to establish Zion in preparation for the Lord's millennial reign.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the grand sweep of these covenant promises and obligations. What begins in baptism continues in the temple with divine promises that are breathtaking in their scope and in their power. They connect us to the ancient prophets, to the great work of the Lord in the earth, and to the Second Coming of the Savior. Yet, I also love the sweet truth that they are very intimate and personal. I have felt this many times in the house of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Once I sat in a temple sealing room where I saw a young man and young woman sealed for time and all eternity. I knew the young man, and I knew of the path he had traveled. It was a hard path, full of pain and heartache; but also of the Lord's tender mercies and His grace. I looked across the room at the young man's mother. I knew of the pain she had felt for her son, and I could see on her face pure joy as tears flowed down her cheeks. I knew also the path the young woman had walked. I knew of her goodness and her great faith that had sustained her in difficult hours.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I watched this beautiful scene, there came into my mind a thought I knew was from the Holy Ghost. These are the words I felt: This is why He did it--this is why Jesus went into the Garden and hung on the cross. This is why He suffered crushing agony and gave His life. This is why Jesus descended below all things--so that this young man, so precious in His eyes, and this young woman, so choice, so beloved of Him, could be clean and worthy, healed and whole, sealed forever by His power as husband and wife in the new and everlasting covenant, heirs to all the promises and all the blessings a loving Heavenly Father could bestow.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want you to hold in your mind for just a moment the image of the young man and young woman in the temple of the Lord. Everything about that scene that matters comes from Jesus Christ. They are in the Lord's house; the ordinance was given by Him; it is His priesthood, His sealing power that joins them forever; the keys of the priesthood that authorize that ordinance are His; it is His atoning sacrifice that cleansed the couple from sin and made possible their entrance into His house. Everything that matters in that glorious, blessed scene comes from the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />And everything I have mentioned, we enjoy today because of the Prophet Joseph. It was through him that the Savior and His ancient prophets restored to the earth all of these great blessings. Surely, it is with joy that we declare: Jesus is the Christ, and Joseph is His prophet.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, you and I need a testimony, a witness from the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer and that Joseph Smith was divinely called to restore to the earth the fulness of the gospel of Christ and the Lord's true Church. We need to act on that witness to receive sacred ordinances and live the covenants, laws, and commandments in the Lord's true and living Church. If we do, we will experience a deeper and deeper conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ born of resilient faith in the Savior and the ministry of the Holy Ghost. We need that deepening conversion because we live in challenging, even dangerous times.&nbsp;<br /><br />It has been so since Joseph's day. From the moment he walked out of the Sacred Grove until the mob murdered him in Carthage Jail, Joseph was persecuted and attacked. The members of the Church were driven from their homes many times, and many were killed. The early Saints also faced the temptations and distractions of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />The attacks on the Prophet Joseph and the Church and its members in our day are more spiritual and subtle, but no less deadly. We face a world of growing evil and darkness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, this is exactly why the Lord called Joseph and why He calls prophets, seers, and revelators today in His true and living Church.&nbsp;<br />As the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;Lord called many to support and help Joseph in the great work of the Restoration. One of these was Oliver Cowdery, to whom the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn14" target="_self">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Oliver was commanded to stand by Joseph, to defend him and support him in proclaiming the fulness of the gospel of Christ in the world. The Lord promised Oliver that if he would stand by Joseph and keep the commandments of God with faith in Christ and with all diligence in whatsoever circumstances might come, the Lord and Savior would stand by Oliver and "encircle him in the arms of [His] love."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_04_23_Clark.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may be wondering, would I have defended Joseph and supported him in the dark hours of apostasy in Kirtland? Would I have stood by Joseph in Zion's Camp, in Missouri, in Liberty Jail, in Nauvoo, and at Carthage? Would I have stood by Joseph through all of that? But those were not our days. Our days are now in Rexburg, Idaho, at BYU-Idaho. The question for us is: Do we stand by Joseph now? Do we bear witness of Joseph as the great prophet of the Restoration? Do we stand by Joseph when people heap upon him ridicule or call him a fraud? Do we stand by Joseph by standing by the living prophet in our day, President Thomas S. Monson? He stands where Joseph stood. We cannot stand by Joseph if we do not stand by the Lord's living prophet. Do we stand by Joseph by being valiant in the testimony of Jesus and true to the covenants we have made? Are our lives a living witness of the Christ whom Joseph revealed to us in this last dispensation? Is the restored gospel of Jesus Christ alive in us?&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, Oliver's call to stand by Joseph is our call and his promise is our promise. I pray that each of us may have a witness that Jesus is the Christ and Joseph is His prophet. I know that if we act with faith in Christ, in all diligence to live that witness, the plain and simple truths of the gospel of Christ will be alive in us. We will stand by Joseph, and the Lord Jesus Christ will stand by us and encircle us in the arms of His love. I know that is true. I bear witness of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. I know He lives. And I know that Joseph is His prophet. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former President, General Relief Society</p>
<p>Julie Bangerter Beck was serving as the first counselor in the General Young Women Presidency prior to receiving her call to direct the Church's women's service organization.<br /><br />As a child she learned to speak Portuguese when she lived in Brazil with her parents and 10 brothers and sisters while her father served as mission president.<br /><br />She is a graduate of Dixie College and Brigham Young University.<br /><br />Beck was a full-time homemaker prior to her service in the Young Women general presidency.<br /><br />Beck and her husband are the parents of three children.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>My husband just leaned over to me and said, "Can you feel the Spirit here?" And it is a wonderful opportunity to be here and partake in that blessing together with you. As I was looking out on the audience, I thought, "who is here?" and maybe you can show by a raise of your hands if you fit into any of these categories. It won't be comprehensive, but how many of you are enrolled in school here at BYU&shy;-Idaho right now? How many are full time students? And part time students? How many will graduate within the next year? How many have been on missions? And how many of you have a mission call or are anticipating a mission call soon? How many of you have been endowed in the temple? How many are married? How many have children? How many have grandchildren?<br /><br />How many woke up tired this morning? That covers me. I was nervous all night long about this opportunity and to top that off, we had to drive up here, and as you get closer to Rexburg the anticipation and the worry increases. It sort of adds to the tension. But thank you for being here. This talk is primarily for those of you who are enrolled in school here. But I think it touches on all of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I served on the Church Board of Education, I thought often about the interest the First Presidency has in the rising generation in the youth of the Church and how much of the Lord's storehouse and resources goes into building this generation. Often times when I'm with younger members of the Church I'll say, "Why are you so special? Why do you think you get so much of the Lord's storehouse invested in you?" And if I were to open that up to your comments right now, I'd probably get the same replies I often get. You might say, "We're the rising generation and we're special. The future of the kingdom depends upon us. And we were valiant before we were born" and so on. But I want you to know that when I was your age a long time ago they use to tell us the same things.&nbsp;<br /><br />They used to tell us that we were special; that we were the amazing generation born on the earth. And I have wondered sometimes as I have listened over the years, did the Church leaders have it wrong then? Or did we just not measure up? And as I've studied that question, I've come to the realization that what makes you special is the covenants you have been permitted to make with the Lord and the responsibility you have. You're not special because of your age or the time on the earth you were born. Thousands of years ago the apostle Peter was telling the members of the Church, "you're special, you're part of this chosen generation" (see 1 Peter 2:9). And it has something to do with the covenant s that you've been permitted to make.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I've thought about this opportunity since last November when President Clark called me, I have pondered and prayed throughout that time, and every so often I'd get a thought and I'd write it down on a piece of paper and put it in my folder. That's been my practice to collect the thoughts that come in my prayers and in my moments in the temple and then as the time gets closer I'll pull those out and study them. I was surprised to find that I had over half a dozen references to the same scripture and the same teaching. And I realized that the Lord has an interest in me focusing on something with you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many of you as you indicated have served missions; and some will be serving missions. Many of you have raised your hands and said you have been endowed in the temple and you've made temple covenants. And I hope that what I speak about today will help increase your understanding of the temple and the covenants that are made there and explore some of the instructions that were given to Adam and Eve when the Lord sent them down to earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, Adam and Eve were beginners. We learn in Genesis that they were the first covenant keeping man and woman--the first sealed couple. We've been told this by our prophets and apostles. If you think back, all the way back to them, you realize they didn't have the teachings of Isaiah, they didn't have the teachings of Nephi, they didn't have the Doctrine and Covenants, and they didn't have any manuals or seminary teachers. They had a specific purpose and covenant to keep but they didn't have all the rich treasure trove of teaching that you have had in your lives. As the Lord began teaching Adam and Eve, He needed them to remember His instructions so simply and so clearly that they could carry it around in their heads and remember, and live His instructions to them.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, the first instruction He gives them, (you can find this in Genesis chapter one if you want to follow along, this is in chapter one, verses 26 through 28) He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that crept upon the earth.So God created man in his&nbsp;<em>own</em>&nbsp;image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>
<p>The Lord's first instruction to Adam and Eve was to be fruitful. What does that mean to be fruitful, to live a fruitful life? This life of multiplying and replenishing, subduing, having dominion, is a godlike life. It is a way of living to prepare for life with our Heavenly Father. To be fruitful! Is that not a simple instruction? If you can understand that you could learn how to be like God.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Be Fruitful</strong><br />Let's explore the meaning of some of these words, "being fruitful" and then some of the following words that were given with that. To be "fruitful" means to produce an abundant yield; a harvest; an outcome or a product. And ultimately our lives are the fruit that the Lord gathers in. In Jacob 5, you can read that wonderful allegory about a harvest and getting the natural fruit, which is most precious to the Lord, and most precious from the beginning. When our lives yield abundantly the gospel principles of faith, obedience, repentance, hope, charity and so forth, we start to become that fruit that the Lord speaks of--that natural fruit with godlike qualities in our lives. How to be fruitful is then described in the words that follow.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Multiply</strong><br />Think of the word "multiply". Multiplying means to increase in number, amount or extent or degree. As you read and study the scriptures and the words of the prophets you know you are meant to increase your talents and multiply your abilities. We are here to share the gospel and multiply the number of God's children who make covenants with Him. If you've been to the temple you recognize that the Lord has given a direct command to bear and rear children: to multiply the number of family members in our own families through marrying and having children. Multiplying is a godlike principle that helps us be fruitful.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Replenish</strong><br />The word "replenish" means to make full or complete, to resupply or to nourish. As we've studied the gospel, we learn we are to feed our spirit, we feed our bodies and take care of them, we teach our families, we build the kingdom. And we fill our lives with things that inspire and lift. This connotes learning and improving minds and homes. As you go to class here and you learn about chemistry or psychology or the Book of Mormon, you are replenishing and building that supply that the Lord has given you. Replenishing also connotes completing the covenants and making sure that they occur in your lives. When you partake of the sacrament each week you are replenishing as you renew that covenant, that blessing in your life, the Atonement. So the concept of replenishing adds to your fruitfulness . And it's a tremendous godlike principle.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Subdue</strong><br />The word "subdue" means to bring under control, to vanquish or conquer. In the gospel we are asked to conquer evil in our own hearts and lives and to vanquish fear and control our thoughts. We are asked to triumph over adversity in our lives and subdue the challenges that come. In our own lives and families and homes we are expected to subdue all evil influences. So we get all this instruction about use of time and media and being careful about what we're learning and putting into our minds because we have to subdue the things that are not correct. It is a lifelong effort to subdue unhappy thoughts and worries about things that don't matter and unrighteous thoughts and opinions. But that's one of our responsibilities, is not just to subdue the earth, and the things that are in the earth, but to subdue everything that prevents us from becoming what our Heavenly Father expects us to become.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Dominion</strong><br />What does having dominion mean? Having dominion means having authority or sovereignty, control or ownership. It means to rise above something and master it. Dominion connotes leadership. And again in a gospel sense, it is our responsibility to master our mortal weaknesses and thoughts and things that bring us down. To have dominion has direct relation to our families and our authority and sovereignty and responsibility to direct and to teach in our families.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Dress and Keep</strong><br />Let's go to Genesis chapter 2 to verse 15, "And the Lord took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."So, what did those two words mean, when Adam and Eve were told to "dress and keep"? To dress means to adorn or cultivate, to shape or clean, to plan and to teach. It's a very active word connoting something in our lives or our families--the people around us. We need "dressing" to adorn, to make things better and to take care of them. It takes planning and thoughtfulness.&nbsp;"Keeping" also means to take charge, to maintain in good order, to protect and defend and guard against any bad thing.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Review of the definition of being fruitful</strong><br />As you look at these over-riding concepts, think of a loving Heavenly Father who wanted to direct His first covenant couple to live a life He would have them live in order to prepare for life with Him. And He said to Adam and Eve:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Be fruitful; multiply and replenish, subdue and have dominion, dress and keep."</p>
<p>You see how simple those instructions are. As Adam and Eve could remember those words, then they would start to have a more godlike life. &nbsp;<br />Now these instructions we also learn in Abraham. (I love the Book of Abraham. You're getting just a skimming of some of the study I've had. But if you want to, go back and learn more about what these words mean, read Genesis. Read Moses. Read Abraham. Read what the prophets have said about these instructions and see how the Lord has applied them.) But in the time before we came to the earth, this is in chapter 3 verse 23 where:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God saw these souls...</p>
<p>That's us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he stood in the midst of them and said: These I will make my rulers; for He stood among those that were spirits, and He saw that they were good; and He said unto me; Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</p>
<p>And then in verse 25, he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</p>
<p>So we were sent here to earth to prove ourselves, to see if we would do those things that would help us have a fruitful life. This is not a concept of a sedimentary, static life. It connotes work and effort. As we read in Moses, chapter 5, the beginning of that wonderful chapter, when Adam and Eve left the Garden after the Lord had driven them out:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Adam began to till the earth, and to have dominion over all of the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I the Lord had commanded him. And Eve, also his wife, did labor with him.</p>
<p>This idea of being fruitful took effort on the part of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p><strong>Our Environment Today<br /></strong>Now let's read about some of the things you are confronting in the world today. If you want to turn to 2 Timothy, chapter &nbsp;3, we'll just skim over some of that. Because when you go to the temple you get instructions and you have to live in the world, the real world today. So in the last days, it says, in verse 1:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</p>
<p>Think of that description in terms of what I have just described as a fruitful life of multiplying, replenishing, subduing, dominating, dressing and keeping. In the last days you live in a world that doesn't believe in living a fruitful life. Turn to 2 Nephi 28 verses 20 through 23 where it's describing: "For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good."&nbsp;<br /><br />So in our day we see cultures of discontent, unhappiness, and misery. That's what is portrayed in popular culture, movies, and often in politics to stir people up against things that are good. Anger is part of this. Verse 21 is another tactic of the adversary, "And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, saying all is well." I would describe that in our modern terms as apathy. &nbsp;As you look around you in modern culture and how things are portrayed and taught, you will come right up against the idea of apathy. We hear, "Why should it matter? Why do we care? Why bother?" Match that up against a description of being fruitful.&nbsp;<br /><br />The third tactic of the adversary today, "Others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and saying I am no devil, for there is none." This flattery I would describe in our day as entitlement. Entitlement is a concept that is taught almost as a religion across the world today. Measure that against the command to be fruitful. All of these tactics of the adversary are very successful because they make life simpler for people who don't desire to be fruitful, to multiply, replenish, subdue, have dominion, and dress and keep.&nbsp;<br /><br />The devil's tactics are alive and well today. You can also study them in Alma chapter 30. There are all forms of Korihor abroad in the earth today. An anti-Christ would teach you all kinds of things that would take you off your path and covenant to be fruitful. That's what we're guarding against today. For example, we are facing today increasing opposition to families, to a man and a woman being sealed in the Lord's covenant. Fewer and fewer people are valuing a sacred covenant relationship. We also see much denigration about the idea of multiplying; of families with children, (having children and more family members). [We guard] against anything that gets in the way of parenthood and the idea of increasing the number of the Lord's children in the covenant, [because this opposition] is not according to the Lord's plan and command to be fruitful.&nbsp;<br /><br />We live today in a telestial world with a celestial obligation. So we have to adapt and we have to work hard to live the Lord's covenant. We know that people, governments, cultures and civilizations that follow the adversary's way of apathy, entitlement, and anger ultimately are destroyed. They're living a life that leads them to extinction. Whereas those who make and keep a covenant with our Heavenly Father live a fruitful life of multiplying, replenishing, subduing and having dominion and dressing and keeping their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Often our daily battle against opposition leaves us too exhausted to do the things in our lives and homes that would help us do all that is "praiseworthy and of good report" (Article of Faith 13). Read with me in Moroni, chapter 7, this wonderful way to judge. Verse 16:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with the perfect knowledge that is of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</p>
<p><strong>Our Savior and Covenant with Him</strong><br />Now, with the Lord's command to be fruitful, He also knew none of us would be perfect in following that command; that we would need His help, we would need intervention and mercy and miracles. We would not be able to live a fruitful life according to His description unless we were blessed by an eternal power and authority that would redeem and exalt His children. This is where the Savior stepped forward [as described] in Abraham chapter 3 and said, "Here am I. Send me." And He offered to provide an atonement to make up the difference for imperfectly lived lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, when we go to the temple and make covenants, this is then our promise, and we receive the power and the blessing and the privileges to be able to accomplish this fruitful living. When you go to the temple, you do not go through the temple as if you are going through a drive-up window of a fast food restaurant. You are not going there to take anything out as in people saying, "I'm going to the temple to take out my endowment." We go to the temple to receive our gift. It is an endowment we receive. In the temple we receive the instructions, the tools and all the blessings that allow us to live a fruitful life. A friend recently described the blessings of the priesthood as "the power and authority by which all the blessings of the Lord's Atonement are administered." And we're taught in the book "Daughters in My Kingdom," that Heavenly Father's sons and daughters are equally blessed as they draw upon the powers of the priesthood (page 127).&nbsp;<br /><br />So when you go to the temple, which is the Lord's great university, from now until the last visit you will have in the temple on this earth, you should go with the idea that you are going to pay attention. Pay attention to all that is said and done there; to how it is done; the different responsibilities each person has to help us access Heavenly Father's blessings in our lives. The scriptures, since the time of Adam and Eve, have then become [in part] a record of some of the people who have made covenants with our Heavenly Father and how they've tried amidst opposition to live the commandment to be fruitful, to multiply and replenish, to subdue, have dominion, to dress and keep their lives. In our recent General Conference, Elder Ballard gave a wonderful discourse about the priesthood and the blessings of the priesthood. You can read that before you go to the temple next time and prepare to learn.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Examples of Fruitful Living</strong><br />Any growing and harvest time requires miracles. As we drove up here today we passed the beautiful farms and ranches and we thought, "what faith it takes to sow the seed and then pray for the right amounts of light and water in order to make that fruit grow so we can have an abundant harvest, a fruitful harvest."&nbsp;<br /><br />When my parents were married they went on a little car trip for their honeymoon. They decided that they were going to have this family and they needed to know how to take care of their family. My mother was always one who was a planner. So, on a paper sack she started taking notes of their conversation. She said, "What is our family going to be like? What do we want them to accomplish? Do we want our children to be married in the temple? Do we want our children to serve missions? Do we want our children to receive a university education?" And my father on his honeymoon agreed to everything. He even said they should all take piano lessons. So then they said, "Well, in order to do that then we'll have home evening, and we'll have scripture study. We'll go to church every week; we will accept callings and serve. We will teach them the gospel to the best of our ability." When my mother came to the idea of education, my father said, I believe in education but I'm a poor man. So she wrote down "work." "We'll have to teach them to work."&nbsp;<br /><br />And those principles started to emerge in their family and come into operation in their lives. They didn't know their family would grow to include ten children. They didn't know they would be in the university business for 25 years, and by then the grandchildren were starting to come and get into universities. They didn't know the effort it would take to send out six missionaries, to prepare ten children for temple marriages, and then as the grandchildren came, 65 of them, they felt their responsibility increased. But I have always been touched by that story of my parents who upon making a covenant with the Lord got to work making a plan for how to multiply, replenish, subdue, have dominion, to dress and keep in their family because they had this vision of a fruitful, abundant harvest.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, in Moses &nbsp;chapter 7, we read about our time and you'll recognize some of what's happening. In Moses 7, (and 6 too, it's all great) verse 62 says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And righteousness will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten; his resurrection from the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all men; and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with the flood, to gather out mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, an Holy City that my people may gird up their loins, and be looking forth to the time of my coming.</p>
<p>Now brothers and sisters don't you just feel this flood coming--of missionaries joining the flood, of a force to go out and multiply the number of Heavenly Father's children in the covenant? Don't you just feel the impact of a fruitful season in the Church--of righteousness and truth sweeping the earth? But, all of that will be for naught if missionaries return from their missions without the vision of truly being fruitful; of multiplying, of replenishing in their own families of creating this covenant in their own lives, and creating homes that will be fruitful unto the Lord. Not all of you came from an amazing, fruitful background. I had a father-in-law who came from difficult circumstances as a young man and he told me several times, "You have two chances for a happy, eternal family. The first one is the one you're born into; and the second one is the one you create. And it's the second one that counts. Don't blow your second chance," he said.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Be Fruitful</strong><br />So this idea of being fruitful and preserving is important. And the covenants you've made are important. If you'll study in the Doctrine and Covenants about the power that the Lord is giving us through His blessings, you will be amazed. Section 84 (verses 19-21) in the Doctrine and Covenants teaches us about some of the things that happen in the temple. "This greater priesthood" that administers the gospel and holds the key of the mysteries of the kingdom "even the key of the knowledge of God. Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest. And without the ordinances thereof and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto man in the flesh." If there were time, I would explore with you the godly power that comes into our lives with each covenant we make and every ordinance we receive. What blessings we have brothers and sisters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, when the Lord comes, those who are standing still in His presence will be the ones who understand this idea of being fruitful. The Savior Jesus Christ came down and performed His magnificent Atonement to enable that idea to be possible and it is within the realm of possibility for every one of us. The Lord told Adam and Eve to be fruitful, to multiply, to replenish the earth, to subdue and have dominion and to dress and keep the world they were introduced into. That is still our challenge, our opportunity, our blessing, but we're not left alone. We have the ordinances and the covenants the Lord has given us that enable us to live fruitful lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear you my testimony that this is the true restored gospel of Jesus Christ established on the earth by the prophet Joseph Smith, that Joseph truly did enter a grove of trees and kneel and offer a supreme, humble prayer with a great question. And out of that question came a great fruit and flowering, even the gospel of Jesus Christ, fully restored with all the blessings our Heavenly Father would give to His children. It continues today and is led through the prophet Thomas S. Monson. Of that I testify as I leave with you my great love and confidence and my hope that we will all access the blessings and powers of the Savior's Atonement to live fruitful lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>I am very honored, excited, and to be honest, extremely nervous to visit with you today. I am grateful for my family and the music that we just experienced. That has helped calm me a bit. I hope that I can share with you appropriately, what I feel the spirit has prompted me to share.<br /><br />We had some excitement at our house a few weeks ago. We bought a car. Notice I did not say a new car because it is a very used older car; perfect for the teenage drivers that we have. There was a bonus attached to getting an old car; it had a cassette tape deck in it. I was so excited; I pulled out my old classic cassettes and have really been enjoying them. I love the cassette tapes, the way they make that noise as the go around in the player, the static, the sound. My teenage girls have been making a lot of fun of me.<br /><br />By the way, this is a cassette tape. It is how we listened to music in my day. One tape I have pulled out is titled, "Automatic for the People." I thought this was a curious name for an album and so I looked into it. The band took the album name from a little diner were they would eat. The man who ran the diner had a sign hanging up that said "Automatic for the People." He said that whenever anyone asked him for something, anything, he would say, "Automatic." He focused all of his energy and attention on serving the customers that come into his restaurant.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love that attitude. He does not have to think about it, he just does it. I want to talk about being automatic--automatic for the Lord. When we chose to be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ and made covenants with our Heavenly Father, we changed. We committed to keep His commandments and always remember him. We chose to do this automatically, no questions or hesitations, for Him. We chose to, as Alma said at the waters of Mormon, "come into the fold of God, and to be called his people."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; What a great blessing it is to be called the people of God and literally represent Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Hinckley talked about the importance of representing the Lord in an Ensign article in April 2005. &nbsp;The article talks of President Hinckley's experience taking clergy through the Mesa Arizona temple right before it was rededicated after some major renovations. He said that one protestant minister asked, "I've been all through this building, this temple which carries on its face the name of Jesus Christ, but nowhere have I seen any representation of the cross, the symbol of Christianity. I have noted that your buildings elsewhere and likewise find an absence of the cross. Why is this when you say you believe in Jesus Christ?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Years ago, a friend actually asked me this very question. My answer was not nearly as eloquent as President Hinckley's. Listen to how he responded. He said, "I do not wish to give offense to any of my Christian colleagues who use the cross on the steeples of their cathedrals and at the altars of their chapels, who wear it on their vestments, and imprint it on their books and other literature. But for us, the cross is the symbol of the dying Christ, while our message is a declaration of the living Christ."&nbsp;<br /><br />The minister then asks, "If you do not use the cross, what is the symbol of your religion?" President Hinckley responds, "I replied that the lives of our people must become the most meaningful expression of our faith and, in fact, therefore, the symbol of our worship."&nbsp;<br /><br />What a beautiful and humbling concept. As individuals we must truly represent the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. This puts a bit of pressure on us as well. We know that others watch us. We are reminded of that, sometimes by friends, sometimes by media. This is why we must be "automatic." We cannot afford to hesitate or justify when it comes to doing what we know is right. We are not perfect, but to be "automatic for the Lord" we must strive to love as he loves and keep His commandments so that we can be true instruments for him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus Christ, in the New Testament and in the Book of Mormon, is automatic in his service to God. He is our perfect example. Take the example found in Luke 18, when Jesus comes into the city of Jericho and passes by a blind man. We learn from the same account in Mark that this man's name was Bartimaeus. By this time in the Savior's ministry, he has many followers; Bartimaeus hears all the commotion around. Bartimaeus asks what is going on, and one of the disciples tells him that Jesus is traveling through. When Bartimaeus hears this, the scriptures say he cries and says, "Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me."&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the followers who are with Jesus get angry with Bartimaeus and tell him to be quiet. They might have felt that he was not that important or just another beggar. But Bartimaeus yells out again, this time in a louder voice. Of course, when Jesus hears him, he commands that Bartimaeus be brought to him. Now I wonder if those who had rebuked Bartimaeus are beginning to understand that Jesus loves everyone, no matter their circumstance, especially those who know him and cry out to him. Luke 18:40-43 says, "And when he was come near, he asked him, Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him."&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a great example of love for someone who is hurting or in need. This man was looked over by others but not the Savior. This is an example of not only service, but of automatic respect and compassion. We cannot always heal like the Savior did, but we can strive to treat others and often serve like he did. I, like you, have examples of this in my own life. Even in my own family.&nbsp;<br /><br />When my oldest daughter Debanie was in fourth grade, she had a big field trip scheduled for her Idaho History studies. She invited me to go with her. She was excited for me to ride the bus with her for the hour-long ride to Massacre Rocks. When we boarded, we walked to the middle of the bus and sat down. I noticed a young man in the seat in front of us. He was by himself and even asked a few passing students if they wanted to sit with him. No one was mean, but they all politely declined and found other seats. It was like a sad scene from a movie--the lonely boy that no one would sit by. I could tell that he was sad and felt a little awkward all alone. I said to Debanie, "Hey would it be ok if I sat with Brian for a bit of the trip?" Her answer surprised me. She didn't say yes, she said, "I will sit with him." She moved up a seat and sat with Brian. What I saw was amazing. Not only did she sit with him, but she started to visit with him, they started giggling and laughing and having fun. I saw this lonely, sad boy change. His eyes shined, he had a smile on his face. I was taught by my ten year old daughter. She, just like the Savior, loved someone in need. She did not hesitate or make excuses of why she couldn't. She just automatically did the right thing and was truly an example of our faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />My father once taught me about being "automatic for the Lord."&nbsp; I love all sports, but I really love basketball. When I was in high school, I was way too big and athletic to play varsity ball and so I played for the Pocatello 16th ward. Church ball was more important than anything to my friends and me. We played hard and my dad coached. I worked with my dad at our family business and one night we were hurrying home to get to a ball game. We were late, it was snowing and my dad pulled in the driveway. He stayed in the truck while I ran in the house to grab my gear. I jumped back in the truck and we headed down the street.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of the street, Sister Olsen, a widow in the ward, was shoveling her driveway. My dad pulled over and said, "Grab her shovel." And then he took one out of the back of our truck and we started shoveling Sister Olsen's walks and driveway. I couldn't believe it. I was not happy. I might have even asked my dad, "What are you doing?" This game was important, not only to me, but to my dad too. Now I don't remember if we made it to the game, or if we won. But years later, I remember serving someone in need. I was taught what it meant to be a representative of the Lord. My Dad didn't hesitate or even have to think about not stopping. It's just what he does. I remember specifically feeling the spirit as Sister Olsen thanked us for the help.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the conclusion of the October 2012 Conference, President Monson said, "May we ever watch over one another, assisting in times of need. Let us not be critical and judgmental but let us be tolerant, ever emulating the Savior's example of loving kindness. In that vein, may we willingly serve one another. May we pray for the inspiration to know of the needs of those around us, and then may we go forward and provide assistance."&nbsp;<br /><br />It is a great blessing to be at BYU-Idaho because these principles are taught daily. I hope that you are familiar with the Student Living model. Student Living is a great resource and reminder to help us live a more Zion-like life. It helps us with our relationship with others here at school, but also prepares us to become stronger disciples of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />The guiding principles of Student Living are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. Love: genuine love and concern for one another invites the spirit, fosters unity, and strengthens obedience in the apartment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. Shared responsibility: Roommates share responsibility for creating an atmosphere of righteous living and obedience in the apartment. Roommates get involved in the lives of one another and refer for help when needed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C. &nbsp;Mutual respect: Roommates live the Golden Rule and value one another as sons and daughters of God.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>These guiding principles help us achieve what Student Living calls, "becoming." It is not just complying with guidelines and tenets of housing or Student Honor, it is becoming a stronger disciple of Jesus Christ by living a life of honor.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this becomes a part of who we are, all of our relationships and future relationships with roommates, friends, neighbors, family and all whom we associate with, all those relationships will become sweeter. I promise that if these principles are followed, we will be happier because we will love more purely.&nbsp;<br /><br />By serving one another, we are literally doing the Lord's work here on earth. We know that what King Benjamin taught is true. "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We really can be instruments in the Lord's hands.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another way we need to be "automatic for the Lord" is in keeping His commandments or, in other words, living the standards that the Lord has put in place for us. This again is a covenant we make when we are baptized. We commit to keep His commandments. This becomes increasingly difficult as the world's standards continue to decline. But if we do keep the standards that we committed to keep, we will stand out as a testament of truthfulness and light. We will have joy and be happy. We will bring others to Christ just by our example of goodness. We all have heard stories about someone who kept their standards and, because of that, impressed others enough to interest them in the gospel of Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share a story that happened right here on this campus not long ago, that not only brought others to the gospel, but brought happiness to all who know Indy.&nbsp;<br /><br />I met Indy three years ago, when she was involved in the Desi Association here at BYU-Idaho. Indy grew up in Sri Lanka and moved to Maryland during the 8th grade. Indy became very close to two friends at school, one was a member of our faith and the other was not. Indy was Buddhist. She loved these friends and after high school reunited with them one evening only to discover that her non-member friend had joined the Church. Those good friends invited her to visit the visitor center at the Washington DC Temple with them. She felt the spirit there and accepted the opportunity to hear the missionary lessons. About this time, President Monson had just been called as the prophet. She said that she heard President Monson bear testimony of the Savior and it was so powerful. Those two experiences really helped her. She decided to join the Church. This was tough on her family, especially her parents. They love Indy very much and had traditional plans for her. Indy bore her testimony to her mother and said that she knew the church is true and needed to be baptized. Her parents really struggled. Indy chose to come to BYU-Idaho. She took her baptismal covenants seriously and served in the gospel. She tried to be an example to her two sisters, which eventually followed her out here to school and attend here now. Her parents began to soften, as they saw the joy and goodness the gospel brought to their daughter. Through Indy's example, and others, her sisters have joined the church. Indy started to date Josh (I am proud to have had a hand in that). They decided to get married. I remember how nervous she was to tell her parents. It was hard, but now they love Josh and their new little granddaughter. Because Indy chose to come into the fold of God, and be one of His people, she has found joy and happiness with an eternal family. Because of Indy's commitment to the covenants she made, she has also helped others find the gospel.&nbsp;<br /><br />The First Presidency of the Church states in "The Strength of the Youth" pamphlet:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We promise that as you keep the covenants you have made and these standards you will be blessed with the companionship of the Holy Ghost, your faith and testimony will grow stronger, and you will enjoy increasing happiness. [They go on to say in a later section,] strive each day to be obedient. Follow these standards, and encourage others to live them as well. Remember the covenants that you have made and that you have the opportunity to renew each week when you partake of the sacrament. Strive to keep these covenants.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago in conference, Elder Oaks taught us that we promised to keep our covenants continuously. He said, "As Jesus taught, those who love Him will keep His commandments. They will be obedient...Following Christ is not a casual or occasional practice but a continuous commitment and way of life that applies at all times and in all places."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are constantly taught, by apostles and prophets, through inspiration, to keep the covenants we make, because they know this brings us happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />King Benjamin said to his people in his great sermon, "And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of neverending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We will find joy in striving to keep the commandments of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before I was born, my dad raced and showed cars. He loved it.&nbsp; He is small and not overly athletic. When he found that he was good with cars, it became his niche. He spent hours working on cars. He is a founding member of a car club called, "The Slicks." How cool is that? In the early 1960s he raced a '52 Chevy that he named The Tinker Toy. The Tinker Toy was an incredible car and even to this day, many car buffs in this area remember it. Most often the drag races that he was associated with were on Sunday and took him away from church.</p>
<p>As my father tells it, one Sunday he returned from the races, pulled into the driveway, and grabbed a bucket and rag to clean the car up. About that time, my mom and older sister (who was around four at the time) came out of the house in their Sunday dresses ready to walk to church. My mom asked my dad if he was going to join them. I am guessing she asked this about every week. He said no, that he was going to clean the car up and get it ready for next week. Something happened this time. My dad looked at the car and then looked at my mom and my sister walking away down the street and he realized that everything important in his life was walking away and that his priorities had been the car, not his family. He ran in the house and cleaned up. He ran to church and he slid in on the bench next to my mom during the opening hymn. She didn't say anything, just reached over and held his hand. He started to attend more regularly and take care of his priesthood duties. Soon his life became centered on the gospel and serving the Lord. He dropped the negative things in his life and grew into someone new and better.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am grateful that my dad remembered his covenants and began to strive to live the standards of happiness. Because he did this, it affected not only him, but me and my children and my sisters and their children. I know that it has brought him and my mom joy. He tells me almost every time I am with him how blessed he is.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently I was visiting with an owner of one of our approved housing complexes, who is not a member of our faith. He has student apartments all over the country that he deals with. He told me that when he comes to our campus he feels different. He loves it. I told him that it did not have anything to do with the beautiful surroundings or buildings but the students. I shared that we are not claiming to be better than any other place or people.&nbsp; It is just that we are unified in trying to be Christlike and that is why it feels good here. He agreed. He said that his interaction with our students has been "incredible." It did not surprise me. I am so grateful to associate with you. You truly represent the gospel of Jesus Christ not just proficiently but with excellence. And because you do, the Spirit of the Lord abides with us here at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember that story from President Hinckley about being the symbol of our faith? This is how he ends that story. He says, "As His followers, we cannot do a mean or shoddy or ungracious thing without tarnishing His image. Nor can we do a good and gracious and generous act without burnishing more brightly the symbol of Him whose name we have taken upon ourselves. And so our lives must become a meaningful expression, the symbol of our declaration of our testimony of the Living Christ, the Eternal Son of the Living God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_07_Hill.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord must have great faith in us to allow us to take upon us His name, knowing that we represent Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is true. I do not want to do a single thing that would tarnish the image of Jesus Christ. The very one, that I made a covenant with to always remember and keep His Commandments. I want to help His image be a symbol of hope, peace and love.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that as we continue to serve and as we strive to keep the covenants that we have made with our Heavenly Father, the Lord will bless us with his spirit. We can be "automatic for the Lord."&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that the Savior walked the earth. That he died so that we can live again. That he taught the same truths that we teach today. I love him for that and I will do my best for him.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second Counselor, Presiding Bishopric</p>
<p>One of eight children (and a twin to a sister), Bishop Davies expresses deep gratitude for a father and mother who not only loved and nurtured their children, but also helped them appreciate the blessings and values of work. Weeding the garden, mowing the lawn, washing the stairs, and picking fruit helped put future work and life challenges into a better perspective. "As a young teenager, having the best-cut lawn in our neighborhood brought joy to me and I learned an important lesson: that a little extra effort can make a real difference in almost everything we do."<br /><br />Bishop Dean M. Davies, was named the first counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on October 9, 2015. Prior to this assignment, he served as second counselor to Bishop Gary E. Stevenson since March 31, 2012.<br /><br />Bishop Davies has been employed by the Church since July 1995 and has filled various assignments.&nbsp; Most recently he was managing director of the Special Projects Department, with responsibility for special-purpose real estate, temple design, and temple construction.<br /><br />Previous to Church employment, Bishop Davies was employed by High Industries, Inc., of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and by Bechtel Investments, Inc., of San Francisco, California, where he specialized in the identification, acquisition, development, and management of investment properties. He earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics at Brigham Young University and has completed advanced executive programs at Stanford and Northwestern Universities.<br /><br />Bishop Davies has served the Church as a mission president, mission president's counselor, stake president, stake president's counselor, stake executive secretary, high councilor, in several bishoprics, and as a full-time missionary in the Uruguay/Paraguay Mission.<br /><br />Dean Myron Davies was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 5, 1951. He married Darla James on June 20, 1973, in the Salt Lake Temple. They have five children and fifteen grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters, what a humbling and remarkable experience for us to be with you this day. Sister Davies and I had a wonderful experience last evening with President and Sister Clarke and a number of you in a Family Home Evening setting. We are impressed at the intellectual strength, energy, and devotion of the rising generation. Thank you for lifting us.<br /><br />We are also amazed at this wonderful, beautiful, and comfortable conference center. To have this kind of facility is a great blessing. I know a little bit about real estate and construction, and what we don't see behind the walls, above the ceilings, and beneath the floors would overwhelm us when we contemplate the multiple building systems that are necessary to support such a gathering.&nbsp;<br /><br />By comparison, our setting today is quite different from what Mosiah and King Benjamin experienced in their day. You will recall that, in effect, King Benjamin called for a general assembly of all Church members. That is remarkable in itself. Think about it. What if President Monson called for a similar worldwide Church assembly? No TV, no radio, no internet. Fourteen million invitations would go out. As a result, transportation systems, hospitality resources, and assembly locations would not be sufficient.&nbsp;<br /><br />But here in Rexburg, because of the generosity of many thousands of Church members and non-members, you have this one-of-a-kind conference center where the word of the Lord can be shared and spoken in an air-conditioned and padded-seat environment. Please appreciate it! Take care of it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I acknowledge the blessings of a kind and generous Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ. They and the gospel are central to my life, and I seek your faith and prayers that the Spirit will be here today, to teach, testify, and assist in our learning. For a moment, I would like to go back to King Benjamin. What he said in his introductory remarks has place here today.&nbsp;<br /><br />In chapter 1 of the book of Mosiah, King Benjamin lays out for us the purpose and background for his remarkable address. In verse 9, we learn that he has finished teaching his sons gospel principles and commitments, and that he was growing old. As a result, he knew he needed to prepare for a leadership transition, that is, confer the responsibility for leading and governing the people upon one of his sons. By his taking this step of calling for a general assembly, I think that he not only wanted to identify his son to the people as the next king, but in so doing, he would also seek the people's sustaining of such an important action. This would help to avoid contention and provide for a smooth transition.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then in verse 11, we learn of the second important purpose, that is, he wanted to give the people "a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this [he said] I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />So a proclamation was made in all the land and the people gathered themselves together to hear the words that King Benjamin should speak unto them. There were so many that the account says they "did not number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;They came in a spirit of gratitude and worship. They just didn't come to listen, but they brought "firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings...that they might give thanks to the Lord, their God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;This was a people who were spiritually mature, humble, and devoted. The account goes on to say that they "pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple...[to] hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, with that background, understanding the purposes that King Benjamin had, and understanding the personal preparations that the people had made, please listen to the words that King Benjamin uses to begin his remarks:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to&nbsp;<strong><em>trifle</em></strong>&nbsp;with the words which I shall speak, but that you should&nbsp;<strong><em>hearken</em></strong>&nbsp;unto me, and&nbsp;<strong><em>open</em></strong>&nbsp;your&nbsp;<strong><em>ears</em></strong>&nbsp;that ye may hear, and&nbsp;<strong><em>your hearts that ye may understand</em></strong>, and your&nbsp;<strong><em>minds</em></strong>&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<strong><em>mysteries of God may be unfolded</em></strong>&nbsp;to your view.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we trifle with someone or something, we treat them or it as unimportant. What King Benjamin was about to share was very important and as such merited proper respect and undivided attention. To open our ears to hear might mean that we not just take something at face value but that we listen and hear to grasp the deeper meaning of what is being said. Opening our hearts to understand suggests that what will be said can, by the Spirit, penetrate our hearts and witness to us the virtues and divine source of the principles that are shared. Opening our minds, to me, &nbsp;is not unlike opening a gate to a corral or fenced in area; we are able to go and see and experience things without limitation or impediment.&nbsp;<br /><br />The widely felt success or effects of not trifling with and hearkening unto King Benjamin's counsel can be seen in the verses that describe the people's minds and hearts following his instruction. They said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe all the words....We know of their surety and truth....The Spirit...has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts....We...have great views of that which is to come;...we could prophesy of all things....We do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy....We are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't this a remarkable testimony--an extraordinary teaching moment?&nbsp;<br /><br />I simply state again that we have not come here today to trifle with your time. We pray that you will open your minds and hearts to the things that will be presented, that we all might be strengthened and edified, that we will be better prepared to obey and follow the Savior.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some months ago, I had the opportunity to participate with Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in another setting. Elder Holland, Elder Walter Gonzalez of the Seventy, and I were in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to participate in a series of meetings associated with a Priesthood Leadership Conference. In those settings, multiple stake presidencies and bishops from surrounding stakes come together to collectively receive training and instructions. On the Friday evening before the Saturday sessions, we had the blessing of holding a devotional with LDS cadets, both male and female, at the U.S. Air Force Academy. The chapel setting is quite spectacular with the chapel positioned at the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are about two hundred LDS cadets at the academy and about a hundred and twenty were in attendance. They were dressed in their finest dress blues for the most part, with a few attired in fatigues because of work or other assignments. After the opening hymn and prayer, the meeting was given to Elder Holland to conduct. He determined that in place of formal talks or presentations the time would be given to the cadets to ask questions and those of us that were there with him would respond. A cadet would stand, tell his or her name, where they were from, and then ask a question.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Holland fielded the first few questions and then a very fine looking young man stood, and after sharing his name and where he was from asked, very sincerely, the following question: "Elder Holland, does the Lord give us challenges in life that are intended to impede our progress?" I thought to myself, what a great question from this young man. Then after a moment of thought, Elder Holland responded, "Well that sounds like a Bishop Davies question!"&nbsp;<br /><br />For a moment I was frozen. Why me? But in those few seconds before giving a response, and with a prayer in my heart, I thought about the conditions of those in attendance. The bright and capable cadets are there for a minimum of four years. They cannot marry, they have limited outside access or contact, they are involved in learning how to defend their country, and at the same time they love God, they are committed to keep their covenants, and they want to progress. The response came easily and without hesitation. No, the Lord does not give us challenges or any conditions that are intended to impede our eternal progress. An alternate expression of this young man's question might be "How can I become more Christlike and perfected by the challenges that I will experience in life?" or "What can I learn from the experiences life will offer to me?"&nbsp;<br /><br />We went on to share with this young man that in the very beginning, while we were yet in the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, we rejoiced when the plan of salvation, the great plan of happiness, was presented and offered to Father's children. We learned that it would be a time of testing, of trial.&nbsp;<br /><br />And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We learned and acknowledged in that sacred setting that the conditions of mortality and life would include various naturally occurring challenges and conditions. You are familiar with them. They include illness, disease, disabilities, temptations of every kind, calamities, natural disasters, storms, earthquakes, draught, floods, wars, and many, many others. Some of Father's children may have the challenge of being born with imperfect bodies, without certain limbs or organs, lack of sight and hearing. Others may experience severe poverty or economic conditions. As men and women enter into family relations and children are born and raised, unwise choices by children and spouses may bring heartbreak and discouragement. All of these things are a part of the life experience. Some may question these conditions, even think that they are unfair, and wonder how is it possible that we can overcome them in our effort to return to God.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson on one occasion when speaking of life's journey said, "Our Heavenly Father did not launch us on our eternal voyage without providing the means whereby we could receive from Him guidance to ensure our safe return."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Essential to our personal faith and development is the unmistakable knowledge that our Father and our Savior want us to succeed. They want us to return to their presence. Because of their love for us, they have given us the tools and resources to obtain comfort, direction, and strength. I speak of prayer. Prayer is the wonderful and sublime ability to communicate and share our concerns with them. I speak of the gift of the Holy Spirit which will enlighten and comfort us. I speak of the words of the prophets as contained in the scriptures. These combined tools and resources will give us understanding and direction in dealing with every aspect of our lives. It is important to understand and learn that there are many blessings that accompany the challenges of life. For example, those who suffer pain and afflictions are usually better able to have compassion, sympathy, and understanding of others who similarly suffer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of life's disappointments and challenges may be found in the place most dear to us, in our family. Sister Davies and I have five children--they are all boys but four. We love our children and over the years have strived to do the things our prophets have instructed. We prayed together, held family home evenings, read the scriptures, enjoyed Church meetings, and shared with our children our testimonies of the gospel. Yet, even after doing all that was asked, one of our beautiful daughters has chosen to leave the gospel and her covenants. It breaks our hearts, but we still love her and pray for her. And we are comforted by the Lord as we continue to love her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Challenges may come to us in all periods of our mortal journey. I love the words of Lehi that he speaks to his son Jacob:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my firstborn in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren. Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn9" target="_self">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Life's challenges take place in a multitude of settings, at home, at school, at work. Challenges may come in the form of physical limitations, temptations, and social or emotional difficulties. Relief from challenges may come slowly, other times with more dispatch, and in some cases full relief may not come until after this mortal existence. Our personal faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ and devotion to God will greatly influence the outcomes desired and we can have confidence that the Lord knows what is in our best interest at all times.&nbsp;<br /><br />There have been instances when life's challenges have been miraculously resolved. Certainly, the Savior's life was filled with the healing of the sick and afflicted, and the lifting of the downtrodden--even the raising of the dead. Where there is faith, and in accordance with God's will for us, these things can take place.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the ten years prior to being called to the Presiding Bishopric, I had the blessing and privilege of helping to identify and acquire sites for temples. When the First Presidency determined that a new temple was needed, one of the first actions was to determine if the Church owned an appropriate site, or if not, to find a site that could be considered and approved by them. Two years ago President Monson announced the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple. The Church owned a property on a main road in Philadelphia called Broad Street. After the announcement at general conference, we visited the site. We learned that it was surrounded by more industrial type buildings and was not well suited for design of a temple. We asked the First Presidency for permission to do a search of other properties. They gave permission and a search was started. A number of sites were identified, but two properties across the street from each other emerged as being highly desirable. We presented the properties and received direction to obtain them if we could. We proceeded forward and evaluated the properties and then made an offer. To my great surprise, the owner of the first property accepted the offer without negotiation. This was remarkable. It has been our experience that when a property owner finds out the buyer is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the price is often increased. To put this in perspective, the owner of the second property across the street responded with a price that was more than four times the price that was offered.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I met with the owner of the first property, he shared that he had owned the property for almost 25 years and he could have developed it several times. But then he said he had always felt that the property had a "higher and better purpose." When we offered to buy it, it felt right. Well, we proceeded to contract for the property and started the studies needed to confirm development of the temple property. However, shortly thereafter the city of Philadelphia, through a city-controlled agency, filed a legal claim and action to stop the Church purchase. They wanted to take title to the property. This was a very serious matter. We did everything we could to meet with the agency and remove the claim. We were unsuccessful. This was a real problem and very discouraging. We had felt so good about the property and that it was the right place for the temple.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a last step we determined to meet with the mayor. He was capable of changing the situation. We had spoken with him prior to the Church announcement of the temple and an appeal to him was the last resort. An appointment was made and the Church temple architect and I flew to Philadelphia. There we met before the scheduled meeting with several others including local legal counsel, an Area Seventy, and two local Church members. One of the local members was Vai Sikahema. Brother Sikahema was a very well-known local celebrity who had played football at Brigham Young University and then went on to play professional football for the Philadelphia Eagles. After retiring from football, he became a sports announcer on the local television station. In the pre-meeting we discussed the purposes for the meeting with the mayor and then knelt in prayer to seek the Lord's blessing upon us that day. We were on His errand.&nbsp;<br /><br />We went to the meeting and sat around a large table. The mayor sat at the head of the table, with a city council member next to him, and then me, two more city staff, Vai Sikahema, more city staff, and then the Church architect. It was clear from the beginning that the mayor's mind had been set against the project. When we started to explain the project he stated that his staff had assured him this property was better suited for a commercial office building or a hotel that would benefit the city with jobs and tax revenue. We would need to look for another site. Brothers and sisters, in those situations when all appears lost, that is one of the times when we can and should pray with all of our heart that the Lord will help us. I know that each of us was pleading in our heart for help. What could we say or do that would help change the mayor's heart and mind?&nbsp;<br /><br />I asked the mayor if the architect could show a simple drawing or two of how the temple might look. He looked at his watch (a sign that he wanted the meeting to end) and said, "Ok." The architect started to stand and then Brother Sikahema said, "Mr. Mayor, may I say something?" The mayor was acquainted with Brother Sikahema and said, "Of course."&nbsp;<br /><br />Vai went on to say something like this in a very humble voice. "Mr. Mayor, many years ago as a young boy in Tonga, my father and mother and my brothers and sisters sold our home, we sold fruits and vegetables, and we sold everything we could to have enough money to travel to Hamilton, New Zealand, to be sealed as an eternal family in the temple. You need this temple. This temple will bless your city. This temple will bless your community. It will bless the people."&nbsp;<br /><br />Then he sat down. We were all very quiet.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then the Church architect stood and showed the mayor a few possible drawings of what a temple might look like. As he sat down, the non-member city councilman asked the mayor if he could speak. The mayor said, "Yes." This non-member then stood and said, "Mr. Mayor, I have spoken with the leaders in the community and neighbors of this property. We want this temple. We need this temple. It will bless our city. It will bless our community. It will bless the people."&nbsp;<br /><br />As he spoke you could feel the Spirit come into the meeting. We were all touched. It was a sacred moment. After that, what was to have been a 30-minute meeting, went for 90 minutes. To my surprise, at the end of the meeting the mayor asked if I would offer a prayer in that setting. His heart had been changed. The temple would go forward on the site selected.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are so many miracles here. The Lord knows the end from the beginning. He knew almost forty years before that Vai Sikahema would need to share his faith and testimony to help in His work.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures teach us that in our personal search for support and assistance, there is one, even Jesus Christ, who is there and is capable in every way to help us. In Alma we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And behold, he shall be a born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another setting in the Holy Land, the Savior of the world offered this sweet counsel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I return to the original question: does the Lord give us challenges in life that are intended to impede us? No, he does not. And he gives us this additional comfort as found in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants: "For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_14_Davies.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear young brothers and sisters, you have an incredible future. Open your minds to the future, to the mysteries of God. Many of you will be called to do things that may surprise you. When you face challenges and trials, rather than feeling sorry for yourselves, ask these questions: What can I learn from this experience? How will this strengthen me and help me to be better prepared for the future?&nbsp;<br /><br />In many instances, these challenges may also place us in a position to serve and give service to others. Think of Brother Sikahema. Did he have any idea as a young eight- or nine-year-old boy that he would one day be an instrument in the hands of the Lord to help bring temple ordinances and blessings to a people many thousands of miles away? I think not.&nbsp;<br /><br />I humbly bear testimony of Jesus Christ, and of His Atonement, that He lives, and that He is fully capable of assisting us throughout our mortal journey. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>One of the central research themes of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) is &ldquo;assistive systems&rdquo; &mdash; technologies that help people do, sense, and think. From advanced NASA space rovers to robotic assistants, from robotic legs for the disabled to devices that allow the blind to see through their tongue, and from advanced visualization to software agents that help analysts make sense of complex, high-&shy;tempo cyber events, Bradshaw will describe how researchers at IHMC increase human performance through out-&shy;of-&shy;the-&shy;box thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biographical Sketch</strong></p>
<p>Jeffrey M. Bradshaw (Ph.D., Cognitive Science, University of Washington) is a Senior Research Scientist at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) (www.ihmc.us/groups/jbradshaw; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_M._Bradshaw). His professional writings have explored a wide range of topics in human and machine intelligence. In addition to his professional activities, he is currently completing a volume of scripture commentary on the stories of Enoch, Noah, and the Tower of Babel (www.templethemes.net). Jeff serves as a counselor in the Pensacola Florida Stake Presidency.</p>

<p>Note: The first part of this presentation, which highlights examples of the kinds of work done at IHMC has not been transcribed. The second part of the presentation, which discussed life lessons about schooling and work is transcribed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>I would like to spend the last portion of our time together to speak about some of the things I learned during my school years &mdash; and since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Lord gets the best and the first. As most of us do in our early years, I once held great ambitions for my professional future. However, one evening, a few months before I left BYU-&shy;âProvo to continue my studies at the University of Washington, I had the chance to hear a fireside given by Hal Miller, a professor of psychology who had recently finished his doctoral studies at Harvard. As I recall it, he talked about how LDS students with high ambitions may sometimes be faced with difficult choices that will require the sacrifice of professional goals in order to attend to the higher priorities of family and church service. I was naÃ¯ve, and the thought that I might not be able to accomplish everything I had dreamed of professionally without compromising my covenants was new to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the clear impression came to&nbsp;me that night that in my life I would never accomplish some of the things that I had dreamed of and worked for in my education. I felt no disappointment in that realization, but rather a great peace in knowing that I had other, more important work of an eternal nature to do. I made the determination then to never let my schooling or work stand in the way of my family responsibilities or of calls to serve in the kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been far from perfect in following through on my determination, but I can say truthfully that I have felt great joy in those times when I have made the right choice in giving the Lord the best and the first in my life. Our family grew to four children during the most intense years of my graduate study. Our small children were a great source of joy to Kathleen and me, and helped me keep my balance and perspective during this busy time. I was the only married student in my class, and eventually also took on full-&shy;âtime employment, so my situation was very different from that of my peers. In addition, it seemed that every time I found myself poised to take a leap forward on my dissertation research, my church responsibilities would increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in retrospect, I believe that this church service was exactly what I needed in my personal situation to keep my testimony strong and vibrant and growing. Moreover, it later became apparent that had I graduated earlier, the professional opportunities that eventually opened up for me would not have been available. I have learned to appreciate what Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Since faith in the timing of the Lord may be tried, let us learn to say not only, &lsquo;Thy will be done,&rsquo; but patiently also, &lsquo;Thy timing be done.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way I try to express to the Lord on a daily basis my determination to give him my best and first is to make prayer to Him the first and last bookends of my day. Elder Marion D. Hanks reported having asked President David O. McKay, &ldquo;How would you suggest I maintain my spirituality?&rdquo; President McKay said he did five simple things every day:<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I arise early.<br /> I wash my body.<br /> I put on my new linen.<br /> I subdue my spirit before the Father.<br /> I wait for the inspiration of the Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I know of the great blessing it&rsquo;s been in my own life, I invite each of you to consider getting up a little earlier in the morning than you do now, to clean yourselves up enough to look presentable before the Lord, and to make communion with Him the first thing you do every day. Likewise, make the Lord the very last thought and object in mind when you go to sleep. If you do so, I promise that your sleep will be untroubled, your dreams will be sweet, and if the Lord chooses to speak with you in the stillness of night, you will be ready to hear Him. I testify with gratitude to God, of the great truth of the Savior&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish&nbsp;his righteousness; and all these things [everything you need to be happy and to do His will] shall be added unto you.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Study the scriptures with no less intensity and fervor than you bring to your other studies. I owe my awakening to the beauty and depth of scripture to a course taught at BYU by Brother Arthur Henry King. Converted to Mormonism in Britain during his later years, Brother King was a Shakespeare scholar and professional &ldquo;stylistician&rdquo; &mdash; in other words, an expert in how the subtleties of language reveal to readers, both intentionally and unintentionally, not only the character of the fictional persons in a story but also the character of the authors themselves. Indeed, Brother King mentioned how, when he was first introduced to the missionaries, it was the style of the First Vision account that convinced him that Joseph Smith was telling the truth.<sup>4</sup> In his highly trained eyes, it was an account written by an honest man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother King believed strongly in the virtue of reading the scriptures aloud.<sup>5</sup> He taught the members of our class how to experiment with different approaches to reading the same verse, how to listen to the wisdom of the spoken voice, and how the varying of emphasis and pauses for breath could highlight different shades of meaning in the text. This approach differs from the facile skimming for rapid information ingestion that is the stuff of our daily business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my daily work at IHMC, I&rsquo;m caught up in creating new ideas every day. It&rsquo;s a dream job, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to trade places with anyone I know. However, it&rsquo;s a challenge in the sense that I can&rsquo;t stand still. Although it&rsquo;s true that every innovation builds to a degree on the past, the pace of change is so rapid that I am constantly occupied with throwing away the results of recent efforts to accommodate new and better ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that reason, it is wonderful and satisfying to study the scriptures, where I can have the sense over time of continually building up a deeper understanding of God&rsquo;s outlook on the human situation. Complementing the insights that come from study is the knowledge that comes from trying to live the Gospel. I know that the scriptures are true because I have lived things that mirror, in their own small way, what I have read in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes living the Gospel can be a lonely thing. There are difficult things that you will be called on to do that no one besides yourself and God will see and understand. In fact, I think I could say that such work, the work that is only truly known and understood by yourself and God &mdash; that you are bound to do because of your covenants and that you want to do because of that special, personal love that develops between yourself and your eternal Father &mdash; that divine work, hidden even to your closest friends and family, is the most important and authentic work you will end up doing in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In difficult and solitary moments, I think of a statement in a movie I saw about the life of C. S. Lewis: &ldquo;We read to know we&rsquo;re not alone.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup> To read the words of God in scripture and then, at times, to hear that same voice within&nbsp;my own soul is a supreme joy. Likewise, the spiritual power I sense in the speech and writings of godly men and women eradicates the isolating barriers of time, culture, and distance, and stirs precious feelings of high communion. Because of what I have read, seen, heard, and experienced over a lifetime, I can say truthfully that my faith is more real than real to me. With the Primary children I can sing with conviction, &ldquo;I know the scriptures are true.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The most important thing about your job is not what you are paid to do, but the relationships you are enabled to develop with those you work with and serve, the example you set, and the Gospel you share. When I was growing up, Elder S. Dilworth Young, a member of the Presidency of the Seventy, lived around the corner from my family. He would sometimes come to ward events and tell stories around the campfire. He really knew how to tell a story! Though I hardly knew him, he knew who I was. He greeted me personally and went out of his way to take an interest in what I was doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon I met Elder Young as he was taking a walk up our street with his wife Hulda. He asked me what I was studying, and when I told him he said, in his characteristically direct and honest manner, &ldquo;Oh, why do you want to do that? Everybody I know in that profession is miserable.&rdquo; I said that I wanted to help people. Then he advised me something like this: &ldquo;The greatest help you can offer people will come through your church service. Choose a profession that will provide for your family and give you the freedom to serve anywhere the Lord calls you. Then, when you retire, you can serve the Lord full-&shy;âtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned in life that he was right. I don&rsquo;t think anything I&rsquo;ve done or will do professionally has done much lasting good for anyone. But in the course of doing my work, I&rsquo;ve built wonderful and lasting relationships with admired colleagues and with those I&rsquo;ve tried to serve, and I treasure those relationships far more than the work itself. The Lord has led me to professional opportunities that have allowed me to provide for my family and to help others in need, and have also given me the schedule flexibility I needed to serve in whatever thing I&rsquo;ve been called to do. In that church service, I have had my greatest satisfactions. My most joyful anticipation in eternity is seeing all those I love, my family and friends, in God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Prepare to be surprised. The road of my personal and professional life has taken unexpected twists and turns. Nothing resembling the kind of work I do now existed at the time I started my schooling. Prayer and priesthood blessings have been an essential part of the choices Kathleen and I have made at critical junctures in our life. For example, the decision to change the focus of my graduate studies was confirmed in a blessing from a choice friend, and I received needed reassurance about our first family move to France in a blessing from my father. Major transitions have gone smoothly and minor crises have been averted because of spiritual impressions received in the course of visits to the temple, careful reading of patriarchal blessings, and prayerful discussions with trusted friends and family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unsure of where to go next in your own life, just begin walking in faith a few steps into the darkness, carrying a prayer in your heart. Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave the comforting counsel that: &ldquo;Revelation comes most often when we are on the</p>
<p>move.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup> President David O. McKay told of how a &ldquo;spiritual manifestation for which [he] had prayed ... came as a natural sequence to the performance of duty.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Marry well. In that respect, I am blessed more than I deserve. Here you see Kathleen and me at the Salt Lake Temple on our wedding day, April 27, 1979.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we are a few weeks ago on the night we celebrated our thirty-&shy;fourth wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/MajorForums/images/Screen Shot 2013-08-20 at 12.45.50 PM.png" border="0" alt="Jeffrey Bradshaw" width="300" height="358" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sometimes tell people that I have one reason &mdash; and only one reason &mdash; to think that I am smarter than my wife. And that reason is because I was smart enough to choose her, while on the other hand, she was so kindâhearted that she foolishly chose me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like this picture of the two of us, taken some months before we were married. Kathleen has been cutting my hair ever since. When we were first married, we used the money saved on haircuts for our date nights. At her request, I tried to cut her hair once, but lost my courage after the first few snips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/MajorForums/images/Screen Shot 2013-08-20 at 12.44.26 PM.png" border="0" alt="Jeffrey Bradshaw" width="300" height="365" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were &mdash; and are &mdash; different in so many ways. I grew up in a large family of sometimes very noisy siblings, she grew up in a quiet home with one brother. I love camping, she got more than her fill of camping as a small child when her father would park their travel trailer for days in the middle of a hot, barren desert. I love classical music, and she usually prefers something else. She is skilled in creating beauty with her hands, while I can only stand back in awe and watch. She&nbsp;excels in details, while I struggle to keep the big picture in view. When she drives, she takes the most direct route, while I usually follow the freeway. When I am thinking &ldquo;turn right,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;turn left.&rdquo; She is reliably punctual, I was born fifteen minutes late &mdash; and I&rsquo;ve been trying to catch up ever since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were to ask her about the one thing we have in common, the thing that attracted us to each other as marriage partners, the way she will tell it to you is that we were both &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; In saying that, she doesn&rsquo;t mean that neither of us have a sense of humor &mdash; though at times she has questioned the shape that mine takes. What I think she means is that we are so constituted that we take one thing in life more seriously than anything else: following our Savior. Jesus, in fact, taught that if we were serious about our duty to God, we could not really be serious about anything else &mdash; you cannot serve God and Mammon. In the end, nothing else besides this choice to put God first in our lives matters. From that strategic choice, all the small tactical choices in life flow naturally. They are already determined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me say here, that there is a difference between young love and mature love. Young love is thrilling and exciting, sweet and precious, and the best thing that can happen to a man and a woman in their early lives. However, I can testify from my own experience over the years that there is nothing in young love that compares with the more beautiful, rich, and mature love of a lifetime spent together. We were all witnesses to the sweet moment when, soon after Sister Hinckley&rsquo;s death, President Hinckley confided his poignant feelings to us at General Conference:<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I married her, she had been the girl of my dreams .... And now in my old age, she has again become the girl of my dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>My wish for each of you is for happy and productive lives &mdash; blessings that will come to you in the course of doing your duty. Though I don&rsquo;t want to minimize the many serious problems in the world that seem to be aggravating daily, what I have experienced of the goodness of God over a lifetime has, to my own surprise, given me a feeling of increasing optimism. The Gospel is the source of my strength, my joy, and my hope for a better life here and hereafter. May God bless each of you ...</p>

<p>Bio not available</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were on a humanitarian missionary assignment to Romania right after the fall of the Berlin wall. By invitation, I taught classes to medical and helping professionals at the neuropsychiatric hospital in Bucharest. The lecture room was cold in the winter but they came in large numbers to learn. Most had not been taught helping theories and skills for forty years. One day hospital administrators came to say they needed our room. I said, "That is fine. We will continue next week." But the class said, "No. No, we will find another place." And they did.<br /><br />It was an unused building at the other end of the large complex. I believe it had not been heated all winter. As my husband Harold helped me fill the van with our audio/visual equipment, I said, " It is too far and too cold--the class will not walk all that way." But as we drove along the main road, we looked over and saw them--trudging along in the snow through the campus. Soon they were seated in the cold and vacant building, wearing coats, hats, boots, scarves and some with mittens, pencils in hand. They were waiting to be taught. As we were setting up our equipment, we noticed the leader of the group was also searching for an electrical outlet that worked. She had an old, small, hotplate in her hand, the kind with the little wire coil as the element. And I thought, "These people are so innovative." She is going to keep warm with that hot plate. As I was beginning to teach, I noticed her coming toward me. She put the hot plate down by my feet. "There," she said, "It is not much, but I hope it will keep you a little warm while you teach us." And I was the one who was taught--the great blessing of selfless service, given with a willing heart, no matter the sacrifice of the contribution.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lehi told of a dream wherein he saw a magnificent tree shedding its leaves over the children of men, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy. He said the fruit was sweet above all he had ever before tasted and filled his soul with great joy. His son, Nephi prayed to know of the interpretation of the dream. His prayer was answered through a visitation from an angel. Nephi was first shown the tree. Then, in vision, the angel showed him the birth of the Savior, Jesus Christ and His ministry unto the people. Nephi saw multitudes of people who were sick and who were healed by the power of the Lamb of God. He saw the Savior lifted up on the cross and slain for the sins of the world. The angel then asked Nephi, "Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?" Nephi understood and replied, "Yea it is the Love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; it is most desirable above all things." The angel added,&nbsp;" and the most joyous to the soul."&nbsp;<br /><br />We learn more about this love in Moses 1: 39 where the Lord declares: "This is my work and my Glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." It took me years to realize the Lord was hoping I would help. The sacrament prayers spoke of it--of my covenant, of my willingness to remember Him, take upon me the name of Christ and follow Him. President Spencer W. Kimball said, "The Lord answers our prayers but it is usually through another person that he meets our needs." How might I be that other person? How might I help?&nbsp;<br /><br />I sought to learn more about the Savior and how He prepared Himself. The scriptures teach that He learned obedience by the things, which He suffered. He walked among the people, healing, blessing and lifting those in need. In Alma we learn the Savior took upon Him the pains of His people and their infirmities that His bowels may be filled with mercy that He may know how to succor His people. At the time of His great sacrifice, he first looked to heaven and followed the will of His Heavenly Father. He drank the bitter cup--and filled a better cup overflowing with the gifts of his learning, his growth, his servant's heart, and his tender love which envelope, protect and bless us. He also allowed for us to experience trials, grow over challenges and not weaken us by a constant rescue.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we truly want to follow and help Him bless the lives of others, we will learn and grow to be Christlike--to fill our cups to overflowing with resources. We will learn, not by noon tomorrow, not in one giant leap, but "line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little<em>.</em>" We too will learn by the things that we suffer, by our trials and challenges. They are most important; for it is through them we grow in empathy, tenderness and in a merciful desire to succor others. Sometimes rush to help them. In our practicing, we will look heavenward and plead, "Father, teach us." We will ask His counsel and follow His will. Alma taught his son, "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and He will direct thee for good." President Eyring shared, that when he partakes of the sacrament he is impressed with, "the names and faces of people He would have me serve for Him." We too will not shrink from helping spread the precious fruit of the tree--the Love of God. Albeit in our own weak way! It won't be the first time the Lord has used the weak, and even made weak things become strong. And we will find it is a joy to receive the gifts from the Savior's cup, but even more joyous to the soul to help bestow them.&nbsp;<br /><br />University is a significant learning laboratory. Through this educational opportunity we refine our talents and magnify skills. We practice using them, alone or in teams, in order to assist others. We care for our minds and our bodies as a resource for our efforts. We prepare to bless people through choosing vocations and gaining knowledge. My husband taught our children to select a vocation they love, one where they can hardly wait to go to work each morning. We can better help people when we love what we do. We want to study much and make the very most of it. As my father taught me, "Eat your hard bread while your teeth are good." We choose vocations to bless and provide for our families, with a goal of having a little extra to save and to share. Here at university, we truly fill our cup.&nbsp;<br /><br />A common distraction is our continual and futile attempt to measure our worth and growth against the illusive and impossible goal of perfectionism. That standard of measurement is based upon unrealistic expectations of others and even ourselves. We editorialize and judge our every action, weighing it against what would others do, or have already done. Then we mourn over what think we could have, should have, might have done better. We jump up and down on the trampoline going nowhere. A trampoline is a vertical continuum of doubt and discouragement. We say, "Yes I think I am good enough. No I'm not! I will never be good enough--or at least compared to others." It is a full time assignment. We turn inward, obsessed with ourselves. Such an activity is tiring and fruitless. Perfectionism is a lie, a counterfeit for perfection. We have been counseled to choose realistic goals and efforts toward learning and growing--taking a step at a time, being patient with ourselves and being just a little better every day. President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "Don't nag at yourselves. Go forward in life with a smile on your face and a twinkle in your eye." We can learn much from our mistakes, especially if we don't use them against ourselves in negative personal judgment. Excellence is peacefully pursued, by choice, toward an obtainable goal. Joshua was counseled of the Lord to, "Be strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest<em>.</em>" We are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us unconditionally. We simply already&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;persons of worth, with unique gifts and talents, and as my four-year-old nephew would say, "With all the component parts."&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most meaningful areas of growth comes in learning to relate to others. We may have something in our cup to give, but most often, relationship skills pave the way for our contribution to be accepted. We have roommates or classmates or spouses in our university laboratory with whom we can refine our abilities to reach out in kindness and respect. This is our time to leave "self-focus" behind the "what have you done for&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;lately, and what is&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;place in the group?" It's our time to say, "How can I help&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;feel belonging and important and encouraged. One of the best ways to encourage others is to notice their positive effort. It literally invites confidence that leads to more positive effort. Personal criticism implied verbally or nonverbally, invites discouragement and negative behavior. Let's not wait for others to meet our mark or present a wonderful performance. We don't usually have too many great performances in our lives, but we all make a whole bunch of positive effort.&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember a young Relief Society president who was especially talented and attractive. The president brought to meeting a woman who had never been in our group before. She appeared dowdy and shy by comparison to the president but was introduced with such joy and enthusiasm and the noting of her talents that we all wanted to get to know her. In that environment the woman literally blossomed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Gifts from our cup can be most delicious when given in a corner. When I was sixteen years old my ankle was smashed in a car accident of my own making. The good old doctor in our little town of Cardston was about to retire, but he graciously returned that evening to see what he could do. He worked hard but afterward told my Mother, that although he was able to form it to look almost like an ankle, it was unlikely it would ever bend. Some weeks later, after the cast was off, my dear mother quietly went to work. Many times a day and for many weeks she filled a basin with water, as hot as I could stand, and soaked my ankle. She would then sit in front of me, put my foot on a towel on her lap and unwearyingly try to work the joints. In that little bedroom day after day a miracle began to happen--my ankle began to bend.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are not usually expected to sacrifice all that we have, like the widow who gave her mites, or the widow who gave her last oil and meal to bake a cake for Elijah. But often the gift can be just as tender. After a particular surgery, I fell into a deep depression. I understood the symptoms and tried to handle it alone. One evening I found myself sitting on a chair in our bedroom, unable to walk the few feet to the bed. When my dear husband entered, I explained to him about depression. I said that I would not likely make it till morning as I had so little energy and felt I was sinking fast. He replied softly, "You will make it. I will help you to the bed and stay right by you until morning, when we will call the doctor." And he did.&nbsp;<br /><br />There were two great men in Church History who were at different stages in their developmental process toward maturity. The period of time was when the saints needed to leave Kirtland and sell or leave, not just the property of the Church, but their own as well. One of the two men found it difficult to leave. It was hard for him; He held on. The Lord said of him, that he should be "ashamed of all his littleness of soul before me," that he should not, covet the drop and neglect the more weighty matters. My heart cringed as I thought of my own, "littleness of soul." I did not want the Savior of the world to ever look at me as this shriveled, prunish, selfish, little soul. I read of the other man who was left behind as an agent to sell the properties of the church. Economic times were difficult. He was not so successful as he would have liked, but he willingly gave it his all. Of him, the Lord says, "when he falls he shall rise again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase" That brother's personal sacrifice was more sacred to the Lord, who understands sacrifice, than even his increase.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shortly after we returned from our mission in the Philippines, we discovered that our next-door grandson, Cameron, had acquired a dog--a big dog--that he dearly loved. His name was George. Cameron did everything with that dog. He was his buddy. As the months wore on that dog took over Cameron's yard and our "absentee yard" for "his territory". He would defend it to the death and he just about did because when my husband returned after his mission excited to work in the yard again, George was determined to discourage him. Now Harold had had a dog, so surely they could be friends, but when George began stalking him and with teeth-revealing growls, Harold became uncomfortable. Cameron was so hoping for the best but he could see that Grandpa was concerned about leaving the house. In Cameron's mind, he had a choice to make--it was either Grandpa or the dog. As hard as it was, there was only one choice for Cameron--he gave up his dog.&nbsp;<br /><br />What we have in our cups becomes our resource for personal sacrifice whether of the heart or otherwise. Even as we contribute, we are counseled to remain self-reliant. That is to stay strong--physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and even financially. In the very same address where King Benjamin pleads with us not to turn away the beggar temporally or spiritually, he also advises us that it would be well to retain, "<em>sufficient that ye remain from day to day.</em>" The pioneers did not use all of their yeast each time they baked but set aside a little as a "starter" to grow more yeast for the next time. Self- reliance is our yeast from which we grow our resources, refill our cups and have something more to contribute. We are to have balance. That is why, even as we are diligent in our efforts to bless others--we are to "see that all things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite to run faster than [we] have strength."&nbsp;<br /><br />We learn so much through our time at the University but most of all we learn HOW to fill our cups. The "How" opens a door to life-long education and motivation which continually rejuvenates our opportunities and heartfelt devotion to others. Elder Richard G. Scott promised, "When we obey the commandments and serve His children unselfishly, the natural consequence is power from God--power to do more than we can do by ourselves. Our insights, our talents, our abilities are expanded because we receive strength and power from the Lord<em>."</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />One glorious day, my daughter called to say she had been given an opportunity to go with her dear friend who was on the Primary General Board to a General Relief Society meeting in the Conference Center. And joy of joys, I had been invited too! The board member had planned to take her mother who was later unable to go. We needed to go early because the third ticket--mine--was to be brought to the Center by another sister whose mother was not able to go. We did. We went early. We waited by the door of the Center for sometime, allowing others to go in front of us. I knew the board member needed to be inside by a half hour before the meeting, and so I pled with her to take my daughter and go in. I would be fine. She had made the arrangements and was the only one who knew the sister with my ticket and so she resisted. Just before the meeting was to start, the sister, who had some difficulties in getting there, came, and so our dear friend retrieved the ticket. We started into the Center only to be told we needed to go to the back of the line. Again she graciously stayed with us until we were invited to enter, and she led us to our prescribed seating. I was embarrassed to look up. The huge room was full. In my mind, the members of the First Presidency were seated directly in front of us and looking right at us. I'm certain we were the only moving people in the Conference Center and going right down to the front at that. No sooner were we seated than the Relief Society General president arose to conduct the meeting. Later, I told someone that I was embarrassed, not so much for me, but for having to make that dear board member arrive on the very hour. My friend laughed and said tenderly, "I'm sure the members of the First Presidency were just glad you made it."&nbsp;<br /><br />I was touched by the powerfully sweet spirit and teachings of that meeting. And I was deeply touched that it was all was made possible for me because of a gracious friend and her gift of love. Again, I was taught the great blessing of selfless service, given with a willing heart, no matter the sacrifice in the contribution.&nbsp;<br /><br />I humbly bear witness of the Savior Jesus Christ, the love of God, and of the joy of receiving the fruit of that love. I further bear witness that it is in the gathering and bestowal of those gifts where we are truly blessed and come to know what is "most joyous to the soul."<br />&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><strong><br /></strong></em><strong><em>Scriptures</em>:&nbsp;</strong>1Nephi 8:10-12&nbsp;1Nephi 11:8-24,31-33&nbsp;Moses 1:39&nbsp;D&amp;C 20:77&nbsp;Alma 7:11,12&nbsp;D&amp;C 128:21&nbsp;Alma 37:37&nbsp;Joshua 1:9&nbsp;Mark 12:43,44&nbsp;1Kgs. 17:12-15&nbsp;D&amp;C 117:8,11-13&nbsp;Mosiah 4:16,24,26,27&nbsp;<br /><strong><em>Articles</em>:&nbsp;</strong>Spencer W.

<p>A part of me is grateful to be able to talk with you this day; however, I won't tell you what the other part is expressing. It is overwhelming to see this place from this view; I am usually sitting up in that balcony over there about Section 24, Row HH.&nbsp; When I was giving my very first sacrament talk during my mission farewell, I would have never dreamed of standing before such an awesome group.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have found, in my life experiences, the Lord builds me and brings me to a level that he wants me to be.<br /><br /><strong>Dry Rot</strong><strong><br /></strong>I was out of school for about a year and worked for a small firm in Eagle, Idaho.&nbsp; We were doing an addition and remodel to a ward meetinghouse in New Plymouth, Idaho, a small town near the border of Oregon.&nbsp; The building was originally built in the late 50s, and at that time, they built the churches with donated labor.&nbsp; Whenever we would do additions and remodels to those meetinghouses, there seemed to always be problems.&nbsp; On this particular project, we were going to add classrooms and then do a remodel to the rest of the building, including the chapel.&nbsp; The rostrum area, the platform where the bishopric and the choir sits, was going to be completely redesigned.&nbsp; We got the construction documents completed and the general contractor began the project.&nbsp;<br /><br />About a month into the project, the contractor gave us a call and indicated there was a problem when they removed the rostrum platform.&nbsp; They found that there was dry rot in the structure below and wanted to know what they should do about it.&nbsp; I told him, I would leave right away and I would be there in about forty-five minutes or so.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now dry rot is wood decay caused by certain species of fungus, which will digest parts of the wood, which give wood fiber, strength, and stiffness.&nbsp; If the infected wood is exposed to moisture and there is no cross ventilation then the fungus can spread.&nbsp; An outbreak of dry rot, within a building, is extremely serious and infestation is difficult to eradicate, requiring complete removal and replacement of the infected structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I arrived on site, as a new overconfident architect, thinking I was going to solve this situation and wave my hand and give direction that would amaze.&nbsp; When I entered the chapel, no one was around.&nbsp; I looked about the room and could not see any visible problem and to me the floor surface looked fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I moved forward and approached the rostrum area, the floor where I stepped gave way and I fell through the floor.&nbsp; Luckily the building had a shallow crawl space so I was not hurt.&nbsp; As I got my wits about myself and was trying to pull myself up, I looked around and was surrounded by the superintendent and a few subcontractors, who were trying to hold back the laughter because of the scene.&nbsp; Let me tell you--I had a piece of humble pie.&nbsp; They helped me up and proceeded to show me the damage to the structure.&nbsp;<br /><br />I discovered that the areas that were infected by the dry rot were the area underneath the rostrum and about five feet up the back wall.&nbsp; It was amazing to me that the back wall had not collapsed, and I discovered that the only material holding it up was the non-structural face brick.&nbsp; It was a miracle that the wall had held up this long and did not collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; I grabbed one of the 2x6's, on the back wall, and it crumbled in my hand.&nbsp; We had to remove and replace the infected plywood subfloor, the 2x12 floor structure, and the 2x6 back wall structure.&nbsp; The cost of replacement was substantial.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Cover Sin</strong><br />There are some individuals who have sinned and try to put on a good face, just like the structure appeared undamaged in the meetinghouse.&nbsp; However, inside there is a form of dry rot or should I say sin that is present and working hard to cause decay to the soul. There are some who think that if they say a few prayers that this sin will go away.&nbsp; Satan wants you to believe this.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, the sin will not go away unless we make a drastic change, remove, and then rebuild our damaged soul from our sins.&nbsp; True repentance is only through having a godly sorrow that changes ones heart, that transforms ones nature, and then most importantly, saves ones soul.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />We should never delay or postpone repentance.&nbsp; The prophet Amulek said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world<em>.&nbsp;</em><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I knew a sweet sister who had a testimony of the Gospel, she loved the Savior and strived to do what was right; however, she later committed a serious sin that needed to be repented of.&nbsp; She valued her membership, but because she feared she would lose it, she tried to cover up what she had done.&nbsp; She slowly fell and drifted away from the church.&nbsp; Satan led her to believe that she could never go back and that she could never be forgiven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Years went by and slowly her life got worse; she felt she was worthless and she slipped further into sin.&nbsp; About twenty years later, she remembered how she felt when she was active in the church, and how it felt to have the spirit with her.&nbsp; She also could not bear the guilt any longer; so she decided to turn her life around and she earnestly sought repentance by finding ways to make her wrongs right.&nbsp; She asked forgiveness to those she had wronged; she spent much time praying to her Heavenly Father seeking his help; and finally she gained courage and went to her bishop and confessed all she had done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She exercised faith in the redeeming power of the Savior and her countenance changed, her heart changed, and she lived as one who had been rescued by the Savior's love.&nbsp; She had the Savior's image in her countenance.&nbsp; For all those years, she had suffered so much anguish and pain; where she could have had joy and happiness sooner.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14-21,49?lang=eng" target="_self">&nbsp;</a>of<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14-21,49?lang=eng" target="_self">&nbsp;</a>God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was sixteen in Billings, I went with a group to repel off the rim rocks rising up north of the Montana city.&nbsp; I had never done anything like this and was scared spit less.&nbsp; Now, I warn all of you: Do not do what we did. The guys parked their car close to the edge, blocked up the wheels with rock, and tied off ropes on the bumper.&nbsp; Those of us who can remember, back in the ancient days, car bumpers were made of steel instead of plastic.&nbsp; They strapped on me a homemade harness with a Karabiner and serpentine the rope through it; and then they placed a safety rope around my waist--just in case.&nbsp; The guys showed me what to do and lined me up at the rims ledge.&nbsp; My knees were shaking, I thought, "What have I got myself into and why did I let them talk me into this."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Getting up the courage, I jumped off the edge and before I knew it I was hanging upside down, screaming at the top of my lungs, about thirty feet below the edge, knowing any minute my life would be over.&nbsp; The guys from above, kept calling out to me, over and over again, "Turn around so we can pull you up."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After many attempts, I finally was able to pull myself around and then immediately they were all able to pull me up.&nbsp; I was never so thankful to be back to the top.&nbsp; Just a note, I did get the courage to do it again and was quite successful.&nbsp; I later loved it so much I got my own gear, and my friends and I would drive up to the top of the rims and foolishly tie off on my old 60 Chevy Bumper.&nbsp; Again, I caution you: Do not do this!&nbsp; Always and I stress always, have the right equipment and proper training.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are some who feel they can overcome sin on their own and they do not need anyone's help.&nbsp; But just like me, tethered, hanging upside down, I needed to turn myself around to allow others to help me back up.&nbsp; We need to want to repent and turn our lives around, so we must allow and trust others to help us.&nbsp; Many are willing to help, they are calling out, but we need to listen. They are your family, your friends, your bishop, and most of all, the Savior: all who are there waiting for us to turn around and be willing to change.&nbsp; They love you and they will be there to lift you up when needed.&nbsp; But they can't, if you are not willing to turn yourself around.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have known individuals who felt that once they have left home, and they are now on their own and adults, they could run their own lives as they wished, and no one can tell them to do otherwise.&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, this is dangerous; the choices we make now can cause such an effect that we may never recover from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me illustrate this, about twenty years ago, I had a friend who told me his story about himself.&nbsp; He grew up in the church, was a faithful member, and served an honorable and successful mission.&nbsp; He returned home and decided to attend a good university in California that would further his potential career.&nbsp; The worldly influences around him began to take their hold on him.&nbsp; He met a young woman and started to date her.&nbsp; He let his defenses down and broke the law of chastity and as a result he contracted from her the HIV virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Later because of his testimony of the church, he repented and returned to full church activity.&nbsp; He told me, with tears in his eyes, that because he broke the Law of Chastity, just once, he could never marry and have the blessings of children bound to him forever because of the risk and threat of them getting the HIV virus.&nbsp; At that time, he said that the virus had progressed and likely would advance into Aids.&nbsp; He knew he would eventually die soon from it.&nbsp; I have lost touch with him, but I have a feeling he is now passed on.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord gives us his commandments because he loves us and wants us to avoid the pain that will be the result if we disobey.&nbsp; He gives us commandments so we can have full joy in this life, and especially our eternal life.&nbsp; I promise you, Brothers and Sisters, that as you live God's commandments, He will bring you spiritual blessings and protection against the evils and plagues of the world.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sin must be cleansed from our soul</strong><br />Because we are mortal, we may slip and fall into temptation.&nbsp; The Lord has indicated we must repent of all our sins, and we need to do it now.&nbsp; No one on this earth was or is perfect except for the Savior.&nbsp; There are some who have grievously sinned; while there are others who are good and are striving to improve incrementally but remember all must be free of sin.&nbsp; We need to be in control and free of sin which may bind us.&nbsp; In today's world, Satan has successfully convinced the world that personal gratification and physical intimacy is our personal right to satisfy it.&nbsp; He uses media, internet, books, computer games and many other devices, that promote the dry rot and decay that plagues the world.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson explained: and I quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Repentance requires spiritual dominion over appetites of the flesh.&nbsp; Every physical system has appetite.&nbsp; Our desires to eat, drink, see, hear, and feel respond to those appetites.&nbsp; But all appetites must be controlled by the intellect in order for us to attain true joy.&nbsp; On the other hand, whenever we allow uncontrolled appetites of the body to determine behavior opposed to nobler promptings of the spirit, the stage is set for misery and grief.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Such substances as alcohol, tobacco, and harmful drugs are forbidden by the Lord.&nbsp; We have similarly been warned about the evils of pornography and unclean thoughts.&nbsp; Appetites for these degrading forces can become addictive.&nbsp; Physical or mental addictions become doubly serious because, in time, they enslave both the body and the spirit.&nbsp; Full repentance from these shackles, or any other yokes to sin, must be accomplished in this life, while we still have aid of a mortal body to help us develop self-mastery.&nbsp;When we truly know our divine nature, our thoughts and behavior will be more appropriate.&nbsp; Then we will control our appetites.&nbsp; We will focus our eyes on sights, our ears on sounds, and our minds on thoughts that are a credit to our physical creation as a temple of our Father in heaven<em>.<strong><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></strong></em></p>
<p>When we are steeped in sin, we may feel that there is no way we can overcome it, it is too big and too much to deal with.&nbsp; President Monson comparing sin in our lives as our Goliaths said: &nbsp;and I quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is there a Goliath in your life?&nbsp; Is there one in mine?&nbsp; Does he stand squarely between you and your desired happiness?&nbsp; Oh, your Goliath may not carry a sword or hurl a verbal challenge of insult that all may hear and force you to decision.&nbsp; He may not be 10 feet tall, but he likely will appear equally as formidable, and his silent challenge may shame and embarrass.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One man's Goliath may be the stranglehold of a cigarette or perhaps an unquenchable thirst for alcohol.&nbsp; To another, his Goliath may be unruly tongue or a selfish streak which causes him to spurn the poor and the downtrodden.&nbsp; Envy, greed, fear, laziness, doubt, vice, pride, lust, selfishness, discouragement all spell Goliath.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The giant you face will not diminish in size nor in power or strength by your vain hoping, wishing, or waiting for him to do so.&nbsp; Rather he increases in power as his hold upon you tightens.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Steps of repentance</strong><br />President Spencer W. Kimball in his book,&nbsp;<em>The Miracle of Forgiveness</em>, gives us five principles of repentance, which we can follow to the pathway of forgiveness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Sorrow for sin<strong>.</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>We need to discover how serious our sin is.&nbsp; Sometimes we may think that the wrong we have done is not that serious; however we need to study, seriously ponder in our hearts and mind, and then pray.&nbsp; By doing this we will be able to understand, what the Lord has defined as serious.&nbsp; When we have learned this, sorrow and remorse will work within us, which will help us to change and want to do everything within our power to seek forgiveness and do what the Lord requires to be cleansed from our sin.&nbsp; When we recognize we have sinned this becomes a very sacred moment and it allows the Savior to enter our life and cleanse our soul.&nbsp; Alma explains,<em>&nbsp;"</em>Justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved<em>."</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Abandonment of sin</em><em>.</em><em>&nbsp;</em>We need to commit to never repeat the sin or transgression again.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will help us to be cleansed, unshackled, and never feel the piercing pain and suffering we had experienced before, because of our past transgression. But beware if we return to our sin again.&nbsp; D&amp;C 82:7 explains,<em>&nbsp;"</em>But unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return."&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Confession of sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We need to confess our sins to the Lord and certain serious sins, such as sins that break the law of chastity, need to be confessed to our local church authority.&nbsp; Elder Richard G. Scott explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You always need to confess your sins to the Lord. If they are serious transgressions, such as immorality, they need to be confessed to a branch president, bishop, or stake president. Please understand that confession is not repentance. It is an essential step, but is not of itself adequate. Partial confession by mentioning lesser mistakes will not help you resolve a more serious, undisclosed transgression. Essential to forgiveness is a willingness to fully disclose to the Lord and, where necessary, His priesthood judge all that you have done. Remember, "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Restitution for sin</em><em>.</em><em>&nbsp;</em>We must restore anything that was lost, damaged, stolen or defiled as a result of our sin.&nbsp; This shows the Lord our total commitment to do all that we can do to repent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Obedience to&nbsp;</em><strong>all</strong><em>&nbsp;the commandments</em><em>.</em><em>&nbsp;</em>In order to have a full remission of our sins, we need to obey all the commandments.&nbsp; This allows the power of the gospel in our life, which will help us to have the strength to overcome and abandon our sins.&nbsp; We need to pay our tithes and offerings, attend church regularly, give service when we can and are able, and most of all we need to forgive others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Savor said: "He that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Elder Scott adds a sixth step<strong>:&nbsp;</strong></em><em>Recognition of the Savior</em><em>.</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And I quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"</em>Of all the necessary steps to repentance, I testify that the most critically important is for you to have a conviction that forgiveness comes because of the Redeemer. It is essential to know that only on His terms can you be forgiven. Witness Alma's declaration: "I was ... in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But ... I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul" (Alma 38:8).&nbsp; Satan would have you believe that serious transgression cannot be entirely overcome. The Savior gave His life so that the effects of all transgression can be put behind us, save the shedding of innocent blood and the denial of the Holy<a href="http://lds.org/study/topics/holy-ghost?lang=eng" target="_self">&nbsp;</a>Ghost.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Trust In your Heavenly Father and the Savior to overcome all.</strong><br />As I mentioned before, we need to have help from others, but remember that our Heavenly Father will be the one that will help us to rise to him.&nbsp; Alone we will never be able to overcome our sin, we must trust that the Savior will bring us up to the level we need to be.&nbsp; We can only come to an earthly level because of our imperfections and mortal ability; however, the Savior will bring us up to a celestial level.&nbsp; We must do our part and then he will bring us up the rest of the way.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me illustrate this. One day when I was working on the standard plan temple, and it was about 4:00 in the afternoon; the manager of the Architecture and Engineering division came into my room and said to me: "Oh, by the way, I need the art glass design, for the temple windows, because I will be presenting it to members of the first presidency and the presiding bishopric at 11 a.m. tomorrow."&nbsp;&nbsp; He wished me good luck and left for the day.&nbsp; Can you imagine how, I felt as he walked away.&nbsp; Have you ever dealt with individuals like this?&nbsp; Interesting thing, I had no idea this was needed until just at that moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I worked about three or four hours on the design, but I could not come up with what, I felt, would be deserving of the Lord's Temple.&nbsp; I was in a panic and came to a point where I dropped to my knees and pleaded to my Heavenly Father that I needed his help, and that I had reached a limit on what I could do in such a short time.&nbsp; Now I debated about sharing this today because of the sacredness to me of this moment; however, I felt within my heart that I should share this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was pouring my heart out to him, my mind was opened up and it was if the dews of Heaven came down upon me and pure thought poured into my mind and soul.&nbsp; I knew what the glass panels would look like and what the meaning would be.&nbsp; I closed my prayer and immediately began drawing what I had seen in my mind's eye.&nbsp; I spent a few hours putting together the presentation and placed the design on the manager's desk and left for home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the afternoon, the manager came in my office and said that they wanted to go ahead with the Art Glass Design.&nbsp; I indicated I was glad and if I had any doubt as I was thinking to myself what had happened the night before.&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, I am not brilliant and I am not gifted, but the Lord, in such a short time, brought me up to the level I needed to be and at that moment.&nbsp;We may think that the sin or the challenge, we need to overcome or conquer, is greater than we can bear, but I promise you in the name of Jesus Christ we can and will overcome if we trust in the Lord.&nbsp; We need to turn ourselves around and work hard to bring ourselves up to a certain level; we must repent and go through all the steps of repentance, but remember and never doubt, the Savior will bring us the rest of the way.&nbsp; We will overcome; our sins will be removed; the damage will be repaired, and once again we will feel the Holy Spirit in our life<em>.</em>&nbsp; The prophet Isaiah said:<em>&nbsp;</em>"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_05_28_Jensen.htm#_edn9" target="_self">9</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;I would like to close and let you know this I know to be true: the Savior's Atonement will work, if you apply the principles of repentance in your life.&nbsp; Get rid of the dry rot that is infecting your soul, as soon as you can.&nbsp; And if there is any within the sound of my voice who are plagued with serious sin I plead with you to see your bishop and do what it takes to cut out this dry rot and rebuild what has been damaged from your soul.&nbsp; I love the Gospel and I love the Savior.&nbsp; I am so grateful for his Atonement in my life so I can be forgiven.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am truly honored to have the opportunity to be here today.&nbsp; I know that you often hear Church leaders tell how wonderful you are.&nbsp; I can assure you that I echo those sentiments.&nbsp; You are the future--and what confidence I have in the future because of young people like you!<br /><br />In our assignment as president and matron of the Draper Utah Temple, we witness many young men and women coming to the temple to receive their endowments.&nbsp; It is an exceptional experience to see so many going forward around the world to serve as missionaries.&nbsp; We recently realized that the change in Church policy to authorize young women to serve when they turn nineteen years of age, while a wonderful blessing, has caused some collateral damage for a few young men.&nbsp; Recently our grandson returned from a mission in Korea.&nbsp; We asked him how his schooling was going at BYU in Provo.&nbsp; He said it was just fine.&nbsp; When we asked him about his social life, he said, "It isn't very good.&nbsp; I find a cute girl and ask for a date, and she says, 'Yes,' but then quickly adds, 'Let's go out and have fun, but we can't get serious--I am going on a mission.'"&nbsp; Perhaps some of you can relate to his dilemma.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last Fall my wife and I set out on a drive to see the beauties of some remote wilderness high in the Wasatch Mountains East of Salt Lake.&nbsp; We were attempting to follow a road that not very many people travel.&nbsp; We had been on it a number of years before.&nbsp; We remembered the beautiful scenery, trees, mountains, and wildlife and hoped to have such an experience again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because the road is seldom used, there are no signs directing you where to go and how far it is to the next turn--or even if there is a next turn.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way, we found ourselves on a very rough road, steep in places, with large rocks and very rough terrain.&nbsp; We were grateful we were in a vehicle that was built for such country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />While&nbsp;<em>technically&nbsp;</em>we were lost--as my wife would say--I knew we were going in the right direction and that eventually we would come out where we originally planned to go.&nbsp; We just didn't know when we would get there, or how long it would take.&nbsp; After a significant delay, we found the road that was our original destination.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Even with this delay and a rougher road than expected, we accomplished what we set out to do.&nbsp; We experienced the beauties of nature, the gorgeous trees, clear blue skies and wildlife.&nbsp; We achieved our goal, but the road we travelled was longer, rougher and had some delays and surprises that we had not anticipated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So is the road of life.&nbsp; As we launch forward into our adult lives, we have dreams and hopes of a happy, joyful, and rewarding life.&nbsp; We hope to find success in our employment, family, and community.&nbsp; We hope that when we are older we will have lived so that our family, friends, and particularly ourselves are pleased about the road we travelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I am confident that when you establish honorable and worthwhile goals and move forward with faith and determination that you will have a very good chance of achieving them.&nbsp; Most of the time, however, you will find the road to success and happiness strewn with a few more rocks and bumps, twists and turns and once in a while some unanticipated delays.&nbsp;<br /><br />On occasion, life's journey may take you to places wholly unanticipated and difficult. &nbsp;Sometimes we suffer the unfortunate and unfair consequences of others who are unkind, unthinking or even devious.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, because while you are on the road striving to achieve the desires of your heart, if you will allow yourself to do so, you will also enjoy the trees, beautiful flowers, the blue sky, and breathtaking scenery.&nbsp;<br /><br />And most importantly--if you have faith in God and look for His hand in your life--you may find that the road you eventually travelled was more productive, useful, and rewarding than the one you originally planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;C.S. Lewis puts it this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We cannot clearly see God's plan for us, but if we could it would be marvelous to behold:&nbsp; Imagine yourself as a living house.&nbsp; God comes in to rebuild that house.&nbsp; At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing.&nbsp; He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised.&nbsp; But presently he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense.&nbsp; What on earth is he up to?&nbsp; The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards.&nbsp; You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage; but He is building a palace.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord said, "All things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; I discovered that scripture years ago.&nbsp; I have used it numerous times, especially when I find myself in unplanned, unexpected rocky terrain.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have come to understand the power in that prophetic statement. "All things, [not just the easy or pleasant things, but] all things work together for good to those who walk uprightly." I believe the Lord is telling us that even our challenges, trials, heartaches, and troubles will end up benefitting us as we "walk uprightly" and stay close to the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over many years of putting these truths to the test, I have gained a firm testimony that even when we experience difficult challenges, as we continue having faith in God, we will benefit more from our challenges than we would have without them.&nbsp; The Lord is kind and generous.&nbsp; Not that we should look for challenges in life.&nbsp; They will find us without too much effort on our part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Years ago, one of our daughters when she was seven years old was playing with her twin brother in an empty field.&nbsp; As they enjoyed their innocent childhood games, they found an unopened bottle of beer lying in the hot sun.&nbsp; As children will do, they threw rocks at it hoping to see it shatter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After a number of failed attempts to hit it, our daughter found a steel bolt and innocently knelt by the bottle and struck it with a decisive blow.&nbsp; Indeed the bottle broke, but the hot sun had transformed it into a small explosive device and as it shattered, the glass flew outward and upward striking her in the face and, most seriously, lacerating her eye.&nbsp; The flying glass also opened a large wound on her lower eyelid and down her beautiful little face.&nbsp;<br /><br />Her brother helped her back to our home and her mother rushed her to the emergency room.&nbsp; The doctors gave some hope that her eye could be saved and that the wound on her face would heal with minimal scarring.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, we were disappointed to learn that rather than healing as we had hoped, her injuries developed excess scar tissue that eventually destroyed her eye and developed a significant scar under her eye and down her face.&nbsp; Over the next ten years, she underwent a number of surgeries to recover as much as possible.&nbsp; As parents we provided love, faith, prayers, and support the best we could.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the greatest challenges we faced as parents was to see her go into the bathroom before going to school, lock the door, and, at least in our minds, imagine her staring at herself in the mirror wondering how she could ever get through the day.She grew out her hair and had very long bangs to try to cover that one side of her face and she wore glasses not only to protect her eye, but to also try to mask the scar on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The good news is that over time a talented physician performed a miracle and helped her recover in a remarkable way.&nbsp; If you saw her today you would probably not detect any trace of what I have described.&nbsp; As parents it was difficult to see any particular good that would, or could, ever come from what we considered a tragedy that befell an innocent seven-year-old girl.&nbsp; Today, this young woman is the mother of four beautiful children, full of faith, devotion to God, and a wonderful, caring, kind, and generous person.&nbsp;<br /><br />It wasn't until last Christmas that we sensed in our daughter's life the fulfillment of the scripture that, "all things work together for good to those who walk uprightly." At our annual family adult Christmas party, each of our children and their spouses were asked to consider a challenge they had in life which seemed difficult at the time, but that has been a blessing as the years passed by.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When it was this particular daughter's turn to share, she certainly remembered the accident as a very challenging time.&nbsp; She recalled the worries and concerns about going to school and facing her friends, teachers, and other students.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She recalled that often she did go into the bathroom before school and look into the mirror, but she related something even more important.&nbsp; She said that in the morning she also went into her bedroom and knelt down in prayer and asked Heavenly Father--even pled with Him--to help her face other students and more importantly to endure her own feelings of hurt and embarrassment.&nbsp; She simply said about those days, "God answered my prayers.&nbsp; I did make it!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was difficult for her.&nbsp; She said that it was only with God's help that she could face each day.&nbsp; He blessed her with loyal friends and a twin brother that always had her back and a future husband that could totally look past her perceived defects and totally love the lovely woman that she was and is.&nbsp; She ended her story that Christmas evening by quoting part of the poem, "Invictus," that ends with, "I am the master of my fate and the captain of my soul!"<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;It was a very moving experience to hear her tell of how this seeming tragedy had somehow also been a remarkable blessing to her.&nbsp;<br /><br />This experience that seemed so unfair and painful at the time became a foundation of her faith that God would help her with other challenges throughout life.&nbsp; Her example also blesses her family and those who know her well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest blessing coming from this experience is that her four beautiful children see their mother as a pillar of faith, strength, and determination.&nbsp; Her example and teachings will help them prepare for life and live more productive, rich, and rewarding lives.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior is our great example.&nbsp; His life, suffering, and death all seem so tragic, yet His sacrifice enables us to repent, find strength, experience His grace and gain eternal life.&nbsp; He showed us the way and blessed us in immeasurable and unspeakable ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />Is there an opportunity--even a responsibility--to follow the Savior's example and strive to bless others when we have challenges and adversities?&nbsp; As we face life's challenges with faith, hope, and optimism and refuse to fall subject to unwarranted feelings of anger, sadness, and bitterness, our lives will be happier and others will be blessed and encouraged as they see how we handle our challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Being optimistic and having a positive attitude will make our burdens lighter and help us find happiness and hope.&nbsp; Even in the most dire circumstances, there can be found a glimmer of hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />As children, our main interest is ourselves and meeting our own needs.&nbsp; As we grow older, we learn to discipline ourselves and begin to learn that other people's lives and happiness are also important--and that we can influence them for good and bless them by our acts of unselfishness and kindness.&nbsp;<br /><br />We often see in the news someone who is involved in a major feat or rescue effort.&nbsp; These are commendable events.&nbsp; However, there are greater opportunities for sacrifice and caring for others that present themselves in less dramatic ways every day.&nbsp; We do not need major events to follow the principle of blessing the lives of others.&nbsp; For example, have you had or do you have a roommate that may not be the easiest for you to relate to?&nbsp; There are a number of ways to react to such a situation.&nbsp; You can ignore the person and avoid the little quarrels that might occur.&nbsp; Doing so might be the easier road.&nbsp; However, you might also see this as an opportunity to be unselfish and give of yourself even if you don't feel like it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Certainly you can praise them for something, even if you do not feel they deserve it.&nbsp; You can be a blessing to them!&nbsp;<br /><br />When was the last time you called or wrote to your parents or a brother or sister and told them how much you appreciate and love them.&nbsp; You will soon learn as you have your own family how much parents desire to feel that you understand them and appreciate what they have done for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some parents suffer too much from not feeling love and gratitude from the very children they have loved and&nbsp; sacrificed for.&nbsp;<br /><br />What about telling someone that you enjoyed their talk in Church or the musical number they provided?&nbsp; Perhaps the effort to write them a brief personal note would be more appreciated than you can imagine.&nbsp; Some years ago, I along with religious leaders of other faiths, made a presentation in a governor's conference in Arizona about the sensitive subject of child abuse.&nbsp; I represented the Church in explaining our position and what we were doing to respond to this challenging issue.&nbsp; I thoroughly prepared for this presentation. Afterward, a woman came up to me and handed me a small business card with a note written on the back that said, "Thank you for your presentation--it was very good."&nbsp; She was LDS and wanted me to know that she felt the Church was represented well that evening.&nbsp; I never learned her name, but I kept the card for many years.&nbsp; It helped me feel good that someone recognized my efforts.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we reach out to others, we not only bless them but we gain greater faith in God and develop our own character.&nbsp; Our adversities are often our best teachers.&nbsp; Most of us hope and pray for the same eternal destination.&nbsp; Getting there requires gaining the virtues spoken of in the scriptures--faith, patience, love, long suffering and other admirable traits.&nbsp; However, as each person strives to attain these similar characteristics, the experiences he or she may have to achieve them may take them down two very different roads.<br /><br />As an example, I know two faithful sisters who have lived admirable lives and learned about faith and patience in two very different ways.&nbsp; One of the sisters said that she learned faith and patience by having a large family.&nbsp; She said that she went to Sacrament meeting for years and hardly remembers a time when the meeting was a truly spiritual experience.&nbsp; Her time, attention and energy were spent mostly in controlling the chaos of keeping some sort of control during the meeting.&nbsp; This large family tested her faith to the limit, but she did develop faith and patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Her sister gained the same faith and patience in a different way.&nbsp; She could not have children of her own.&nbsp; It was a painful, lonely journey, but through the process of adoption she found great happiness in the two children that came into her home.&nbsp; Both of these sisters had very different circumstances; both gained faith and virtue from their experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is important that we maintain our faith in God when we face difficult challenges.&nbsp; He will bless us immensely if we walk uprightly and turn to him even when we do not see the good that may come from a painful or troubling problem.&nbsp; The eleventh and twelfth chapters of Hebrews teach us great lessons about having faith in God.&nbsp; The first verses tell us how God's leaders were blessed when God granted them that which they asked for.&nbsp; One of the great lessons of faith is told about Sara and Abraham who had been promised to have posterity as great as the sands of the seas and the stars in the Heavens; yet Abraham and Sara became very old, and they still did not have a son through which these magnificent blessings could be fulfilled.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even as an older woman, Sara never lost hope. &nbsp;The scriptures tell us that, "Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; Sara never stopped believing that she would bear a son so that the promised blessings would be fulfilled.&nbsp; The same faith is also attributed to Abraham, who the scriptures explain in somewhat humorous terms by saying, "Therefore sprang there even of one, [Abraham] and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Many examples of how God blessed those with faith are related in this marvelous chapter; however, the ending verses are sobering as they teach us good but challenging doctrine.&nbsp; Beginning in verse 35 of chapter eleven, we learn that not everyone receives from God through faith what they desire and ask for.&nbsp; We are taught that, "others were tortured...[some] had trials of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment;&nbsp; They were stoned, were sawn asunder..." and many other similar painful and unfortunate difficulties.&nbsp; Yet, we learn that those who suffered also had firm testimonies of God and His goodness.&nbsp;<br /><br />The chapter ends with, what is to me, the most important and insightful verse of scripture about adversity and suffering:&nbsp; The Joseph Smith Translation says, "God having provided some better things for them through their sufferings, for without sufferings they could not be made perfect."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />So brothers and sisters, we must have faith in God when we receive answers to our prayers, and we must have faith in God when we do not receive just what we asked for.&nbsp; In either situation, we must remember that, "All things work together for good to them who walk uprightly." The goal can never be to avoid every adversity.&nbsp; Things just don't happen that way.&nbsp; Our goal must be to find the good that can result from our challenges.&nbsp; God in His great wisdom and love will do what is best for us and those around us, if we will but turn to Him and have faith in Him.&nbsp; It will often require enduring experiences that are not pleasant or easy, but enduring them with faith will eventually result in greater blessings for us and certainly a blessing to those who watch how we handle these difficult challenges.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is difficult to turn to God when we make mistakes.&nbsp; One of the most touching and valuable lessons regarding turning to God after making poor decisions came from a young woman who became pregnant out of wedlock at a very young age.&nbsp; I worked in adoptions in LDS Family Services for years and could relate other such experiences.&nbsp; I served as her priesthood leader.&nbsp; At such a tender age, she was required to make the difficult decision of what to do with and for her unborn child.&nbsp; After much thought and prayer and counseling with others, she came to the conclusion that she would do what she believed was in the best interest of her child.&nbsp; She placed it with a young couple that could not have children of their own.&nbsp; After struggling with this heart wrenching decision, she went through the challenging experience of repentance.&nbsp; Perhaps her greatest challenge was to forgive herself.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the last times I spoke with her as a Church leader, I asked her, "How do you feel about the Savior?" I will never forget what she said: "I love the Savior very much.&nbsp; I know He lives and loves me and that He has forgiven me of my mistakes and sins."&nbsp; Words cannot express what she said, how she said it and how I felt that day, but I remember thinking that such a young girl would not generally have such an abiding testimony of the Savior.&nbsp; This kind of a testimony was more often found in older more experienced members of the Church.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was another reminder that God is most generous, and He will bless us without measure as we turn our lives and hearts to him. Even when we make serious mistakes and have difficult problems, He is saying to us, "I'm sorry that you made a wrong choice or that you had to suffer such difficulty, but if you will turn your heart to me, I will make the blessing that comes out of it even greater than the disappointment and challenges that you faced going through it."&nbsp; Truly, we can have confidence that "All things work together to them that walk uprightly."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_04_Brown.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The trip I took with my wife that resulted in a bumpy and somewhat lost condition was a little annoying, but it was also enjoyable.&nbsp; So it is with much of our lives--a journey of ups and downs, but a journey that we can handle.&nbsp; It is true that once in a while we may experience some unforeseen difficult challenge that will disrupt our lives, that may take years to understand and endure.&nbsp; But even these challenges, if endured well, will allow us to look back and realize that we were blessed along the way and that we can "do hard things." That we made it even when we thought it might be easier to just give up.&nbsp; We find out for ourselves that we are not quitters. And that is the part, brothers and sisters--we find out for ourselves who we are and that is why we are here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith summarized this succinctly when he told his mother just after the First Vision when he was still dazed and amazed.&nbsp; "I am all right mother; I am well enough off.&nbsp; I just learned for myself that none of the Churches are true."&nbsp; And this is our privilege and blessing to not only live on this earth but to learn for ourselves--to find out who we really are by the things we experience, the things we suffer and how we handle them all. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I received this assignment to speak with you today, I have spent many hours pondering and have prayed that I might say something that will touch your hearts, comfort your souls and inspire you as you work through the individual trials and challenges of your lives. I pray that the Holy Ghost will abide with us and allow each of us to understand, embrace and contemplate what our Heavenly Father would have us learn from this earthly experience.<br /><br />Trials are often like dense fog. They block our view of our potential, blind us to the joys surrounding us, and limit our vision of our eternal purpose.&nbsp;We know we were sent here to earth to prove ourselves worthy to return to our Father in Heaven and dwell in his presence eternally. But didn't we already dwell with Him before we came to earth? Why was this earthly experience necessary for our continual growth? What could we learn here that we couldn't learn in our Heavenly home?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The plan, the perfect plan of our Father, was not only for us to return to His presence, but to become as He is. President Lorenzo Snow taught, "As man now is, God once was; as God is now man may be."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Our experience here on earth has much more meaning than just living through life and being good. It is a testing ground; it is a school, a preparation, a time for development of talents and abilities beyond our own expectations. And just as in any school, learning is not always easy, convenient, or possible without much work and sacrifice. An essential part of our learning process is gaining experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />While in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve knew "no joy for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;Was it the same with us in our premortal life? Did we know no joy?&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2 Nephi 2:25, we learn that "Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy." Part of the reason that we came to earth was to experience and learn of joy, but joy doesn't come without the trials, and we will not experience a fullness of joy until we return to God's presence because in God's presence is the fullness of joy.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the October 1991 General Conference, Dallin H. Oaks said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of the greatest of all God's revelations is Father Lehi's teaching that "men are, that they might have joy." (2 Ne. 2:25.) Joy is more than happiness. Joy is the ultimate sensation of well-being. It comes from being complete and in harmony with our Creator and his eternal laws. The opposite of joy is misery. Misery is more than unhappiness, sorrow, or suffering. Misery is the ultimate state of disharmony with God and his laws.</p>
<p>Each of us is a unique son or daughter of a loving Father in Heaven and as such, each of us will face individual trials and testing in this life. Each of us has an individualized education plan. In teacher education, we call this an IEP. I believe that we have been placed upon the earth in a time in which our particular trials and challenges will lead to the most growth and development possible.&nbsp;<br /><br />Blaine M. Yorgason has penned, "The Monument," as an introduction to his book,&nbsp;<em>Charlie's Monument</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God, before He sent His children to earth gave each of them a very carefully selected package of problems. These, he promised, smiling, are yours alone. No one else may have the blessings these problems will bring you. And only you have the special talents and abilities that will be needed to make these problems your servants. Now go down to your birth and to your forgetfulness. Know that I love you beyond measure. These problems that I give you are a symbol of that love. The monument you make of your life with the help of your problems will be a symbol of your love for me, your Father.</p>
<p>How can problems be a symbol of love? How could someone who loves us want us to face challenges, trials, hardships, discouragement, and sorrow?&nbsp;<br /><br />We, with our finite vision cannot understand God's plan, but God with his infinite vision sees beyond the moment of this earth life, into the eternities and understands the greatness found within each of us. He knows the beginning from the end. He knows how it will all turn out. He knows that each of us have the power to overcome our challenges. Why then is it so hard for us to see the value of the struggles we face.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Holland in a CES fireside address given at BYU-Provo in September 2008 said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every one of us, in one way or another, great or small, dramatic or incidental, is going to spend a little time in Liberty Jail--spiritually speaking. We will face things we do not want to face for reasons that may not have been our fault. ...Every experience can become a redemptive experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the trials of our lives are brought about through no fault of our own--the family we were born into, health, accidents, social and economic conditions. These are things over which we have no control--except for how we will use them to grow and learn. This is not an easy task, and I would have you know that for many of us, these trials seem almost hopeless. The sense of hopelessness and discouragement can only be replaced when we put our trust in the Lord. In Proverbs 3:5-6 we read, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."&nbsp;<br /><br />I was born into a family struggling with problems brought on by choices. My father was an alcoholic. Soon after my birth, my sister, Betty Jean, who was five years older, developed a brain tumor. For the next two years our family faced a crisis as my mother and Betty Jean traveled to Minnesota to the Mayo Clinic for treatments, but the tumor was imbedded in the brain stem and surgery was not an option. My mother gave birth to another baby girl during this time and shortly after Margaret's birth, Betty Jean died. The stress of the loss of a child, amplified by the alcoholism, caused my mother to take her own life at the age of thirty-six, leaving four children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since my father was not capable of taking care us, we were placed in an orphan's home where I spent the next eight years of my life without the bonds of a family or even contact with my older siblings or extended family.&nbsp;<br /><br />St. Thomas Orphan's Home was located in Great Falls, Montana, and was run by the Sisters of Providence of the Catholic Church. For over fifty years it served as an orphanage taking in children of abuse, neglect, illness, addiction and death. A newspaper reporter for a Great Falls newspaper once referred to the orphans as "stray mites of humanity." My younger sister, Margaret, and I were among those "stray mites of humanity."&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Jeffrey Holland, in his October 2008 Conference Address said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the course of life all of us spend time in 'dark and dreary' places, wildernesses, circumstances of sorrow or fear or discouragement...But I testify that angels are still sent to help us, even as they were sent to help Adam and Eve, to help the prophets and indeed to help the Savior of the world Himself...not all angels are from the other side of the veil. Some of them we walk with and talk with--here, now, every day.</p>
<p>It was here, at the age of four that the first of many angels came into my life. The Sisters of Providence were such angels. They provided a safe refuge from the storm that had become my family. My life was highly structured with Mass each morning, catechism, school and supervised activities. Material possessions were few.&nbsp;<br /><br />The school I attended was part of the orphanage but it was also a parochial school to which Catholic children from the community came. Because other children came to the orphanage, I learned about families. At Christmas time, the children at the orphanage were often taken into the homes of kind people in the area who provided gifts for them. I can remember spending the night with a young couple and praying that they would like my sister and me and want to keep us. I, in my child's heart felt that I was not good enough to be loved. If I tried hard enough and was good enough, I might earn that love that never came.&nbsp;<br /><br />During those years the nuns provided a sweet education. Always, I watched over my little sister, Margaret. Those angels provided for our basic needs, but also taught me about God. It wasn't the Father in Heaven I was to come to know later, but it was a solid foundation in faith and reverence. I must admit that it was a "fear of God" more than a love of God. That love for my Heavenly Father didn't come until I found the gospel. My biggest dream when I was ten years old was to become a nun just like the sisters that cared for me. I smile now because even though my life has been changed, I teach at a university where I am called Sister Kay. These were years of isolation in which I built a wall within my heart to protect myself from the pain of trusting and loving.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was ten years old, another angel came into my life. This was my maternal grandmother. After many years of trying to see us, my mother's mother was able to take my sister and me to her home in Sugar City for a month during the summer. What a glorious experience that was and yet a terrifying one, too. For three years we spent a month each summer with my grandmother. The year that I turned twelve, my grandmother asked if we would like to be able to stay with her always.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since we were Catholic and my grandmother was a Mormon, this did not sit well with my relatives on my father's side of the family, and they refused. My grandmother took the case to court and was able to adopt us and bring us to live with her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our angels have trials and challenges, too. My grandmother was a survivor. As a small child her family was called by President Lorenzo Snow to colonize in Canada. They left their comfortable home in Cache Valley, Utah. During the first winter they lived in a tent with blocks of snow surrounding it for insulation and protection.&nbsp;<br /><br />At night my grandmother would listen to the wolves howl in the darkness. Her early life was filled with hardships. My grandmother married out of the church. The poverty and hardships of Canada were too much for most of her family, and they slowly moved back to the United States, settling in Montana. My grandmother, however, remained in Canada with her husband and young family of four children. My grandfather died when my grandmother was twenty-eight years old, leaving her alone on six hundred and forty acres of land.&nbsp;<br /><br />For eight years my grandmother ran the farm with the help of neighbors to put in the crops and harvest them. Then one winter day, she sent the children to school on the horse. Shortly after they left a blizzard came up and raged all day. She did not know about the safety of her children and could not go to find them. As night fell, she feared that they were lost and knelt to plead for their safety. She promised the Lord that if He would watch over the children, she would find a way to leave when spring came. The children made it to the small town and were taken in by neighbors, but Esther would not know this for three days when finally her oldest son rode the horse home and told his mother that they were all safe.&nbsp;<br /><br />My grandmother had little education and worked as a maid to support herself and her children. She buried five husbands and three of her four children, and at the age of sixty-three took my younger sister and me into her home.&nbsp;<br /><br />How she provided for us, I do not know. She had a small social security check and continued to work for a family in our ward during these years. My grandmother lived through her trials and challenges making a monument of service and example. She accepted what life had given her and made the best of that life. She could create a meal from almost nothing. I often watched her do ironing for others. She ironed the white shirts of the patriarch of our stake; they were a work of art. She was independent and self-sufficient. She found joy in a world in which others found sorrow.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was in Idaho that I was first introduced to the church. My grandmother continued to take us to the Catholic Church each Sunday, and then we would go to the Mormon Church with her. My sister and I would then go home and know that we were going to Hell. In the Catholic Church, attending another church is a mortal sin and unless confessed can lead to damnation. The years of catechism were not lost on us and we knew well that we had better live until the next Sunday when we could go to confession before Mass. It was in August of 1960 that I was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp;<br /><br />And then there entered into my life another angel. Image going to Young Women's without the experience of Primary--my first experiences as a member of the church were not without failure. One of the first mutual activities I attended was a speech night. This particular night, after opening exercises, the Young Men's president announced that tonight was the extemporaneous speech competition. I had no idea what that was, but he asked each of us to take a place on the stand, so I did. The Young Women's president then gave directions that each of us were to come to the podium when it was our turn. We would be handed a picture showing a gospel principle and we were to give a two-minute talk on that picture. A young man or young woman would go to the podium, receive their picture, take a minute to look at it and then out would come this wonderful talk. I thought it must be a miracle.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my upbringing, attending church meant you went quietly and did not say a word during the service. How these young people were doing this was beyond me. When it was my turn, I walked to the podium; the Young Women's president handed me a picture. I looked at it and nothing came into my head. I looked around and wondered where the miracle was and then the tears began to flow.&nbsp;<br /><br />In D&amp;C 88:84 the Lord promises, "...I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you to bear you up." If anyone needed an angel, I did. And there she was, Mary Miyasaki, my young women's leader. She stood all of 4 feet 10 inches tall and she came to the podium put her arm around my waist, and just as your mom or dad did when you were in Primary and were too scared to give your talk, she whispered sentences in my ear, and I repeated them. When we came to the end and said "Amen," she gave me a hug and smiled. I returned to my seat wondering what kind of a religion I had gotten myself into-vowing that I would never do that again no matter what. But the Lord had other plans.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Ether 12:27 you will find my mission scripture, because I have watched this promise become reality in my life. "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them." Making weak things become strong requires that we are stretched. Stretching is often painful; trials are often needed, but the promise is sure. He will make weak things strong.&nbsp;<br /><br />But what of this angel? In my teenage years, Mary would become a second mother to me. She would guide me, love me and make me her own. Through my teenage eyes she was perfect. Little did I know at the time that my angel also had her trials and challenges. Mary grew up a Buddhist. She married a fine young LDS man and the following year was converted to the church. This was during the beginning of World War II. Mary's husband, Tommy, enlisted in the service and was stationed in Minnesota preparing to go overseas.&nbsp;<br /><br />In a freak accident, Tommy lost his sight during a training maneuver. Mary was devastated. None of this was her fault. But Mary faced her challenges with courage and faith. Tommy graduated from college and began his own poultry business with Mary at his side. They had three sons and a daughter. Mary worked with Tommy, rising at 4:00 in the morning in order to accomplish all that needed to be done and still have time for her family. She became a community and church leader, as did Tommy. She served with love and honor. She took what life had given her and made of it a monument. She reached out to those around her, including me, a shy, insecure, non-member of the church. Through all the years of our association, I saw only her positive, cheerful attitude in the face of her trials. She trusted in the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Holland counsels us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Everyone ... will be called upon to face trying times. When that happens we can sometimes fear God has abandoned us, and we might be left, at least for a time, to wonder when our troubles will ever end...whenever these moments of our extremity come, we must not succumb to the fear that God has abandoned us or that He does not hear our prayers. He does hear us. He does see us. He does love us. When we are in dire circumstances and want to cry 'Where art Thou?' it is imperative that we remember He is right there with us---where He has always been. We must continue to believe, continue to have faith, continue to pray and plead with heaven, even if we feel for a time our prayers are not heard and that God has somehow gone away. He is there. Our prayers are heard. And when we weep, He and the angels of heaven weep with us.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>When we are involved in trials that we have not created, the Lord has promised us that we will have the strength to endure. Many of these trials are life changing--divorce, abuse, drugs, pornography, economic conditions, health problems, but know that God is aware of our circumstances. If we turn to him, He will help us endure. He will strengthen us.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are trials in our lives that we, through our own disobedience bring upon ourselves. These trials require an additional step on our part--repentance. The Lord has told us that wickedness never was happiness.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;That is an eternal truth. When we violate the laws of God, the consequences often cause us to go through pain, suffering and sorrow.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our choices in life always have consequences. This, too, is an eternal truth. One of the most marvelous blessings Heavenly Father has given us is the ability to repent--to come to Him with a broken heart and a contrite spirit and thus receive forgiveness for our sins.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;But it requires that we reach upward.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was an adult before I learned the truth about my family. It wasn't until my grandmother's death that I learned that my mother had taken her own life. This knowledge filled me with anger. How could she have done that to me? I sensed in a heart-wrenching way that I wasn't loved. My anger filled my heart and blocked the blessings of the Lord. It consumed my soul and prevented me from serving and helping others. One day, as I sat rocking one of our boys, the Holy Ghost whispered to my heart, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_11_Kay.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; The Lord truly had directed my path. He had placed angels along the way to bring me to this moment. I sat rocking a beautiful baby born under the covenant into a home blessed with the priesthood of God. I was His daughter and He had blessed me with an abundance of blessings and had filled my life with joy. Now I was, of my own choice, blocking those blessings because of my lack of understanding. I needed to repent of my anger, I needed to trust in the Lord to make all things right.&nbsp;<br /><br />My anger and hurt were further enlarged with my father's death a few years later. My oldest sister called one day to let me know that our father had died. As I held the phone and listened, I felt nothing. It was as if she were telling me that someone I didn't know had died. I had had no contact with him for over thirty years. He had never made the effort to be a part of my life. He knew nothing of me or my marriage or my children. He had deprived my sons of knowing a grandfather. My heart was hard and that hardness caused me pain and sorrow. It took prayer and time to realize that the Savior's Atonement had already paid the price for what I was feeling and also for all that my mother and father had felt and experienced.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Atonement is an infinite atonement. My Savior paid the price that I might feel whole again if I too would forgive and come unto Him. The Lord can heal our hearts when we take our burden to Him. He can help us forgive. He can help us to heal our families. He can help us to know that we are loved and cherished. The blessings of the temple can unite us again as earthy families with celestial goals. The temple work for my mother and father has been done. I pray now for their acceptance of gospel covenants and blessings. I pray to understand and to accept.&nbsp;<br /><br />Trials in our lives require our constant struggle, our constant climb to the top. Those who never seek repentance never enjoy the sweet blessings of forgiveness. Life is full of mountains to conquer, fears to overcome, service to give and happiness to enjoy.For a day, I stood nervously watching the summit of the Grant Teton as my teenage son climbed under the watchful care of a friend.&nbsp;<br /><br />The three-some had planned for this excursion for many months. It had started out as a priest quorum activity, but when it came down to the climb, only two boys and their leader were ready for the challenge. Brent called me the night before to explain the procedures they would be using to make the attempt of the summit the next morning. "There are only a couple of places where we will have to repel more than a few hundred feet," he casually mentioned. "One place we will have to repel backwards, but it will be okay," he assured me. At that point I merely said, "Don't tell me anymore. Just assure me that you will bring my son back in the same condition I give him to you in the morning." That was a foolish statement on my part. My son did return, but in many ways he would never be the same, for he had been to the top, he had reached the summit. He had been stretched.&nbsp;<br /><br />We, too, will never be the same after going through our trials and challenges in this life, and that is the whole purpose. We skin our knees and bloody our hands as we struggle against the sharp rocks. But in the process, we are transformed into stronger, more loving, more compassionate, more sensitive individuals. Trials when viewed from an eternal perspective bring wisdom and gratitude.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago, I had the privilege while training with National Geographic to meet Barry Bishop, one of the first Americans to reach the summit of Mount Everest. He had endured hardships, risks, and even the prospect of death to reach his goal. But why? He certainly couldn't stay at the top--in fact his time at the summit of Everest was measured in minutes. Why then make the effort?&nbsp;<br /><br />Barry Bishop quoted Rene Daumal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You cannot stay on the summit forever; you have to come down again, so why bother in the first place? Just this: what is above knows what is below, but what is below does not know what is above. One climbs, one sees, one descends, one sees no longer but one has seen. There is an art of conducting oneself in the lower regions by the memory of what one saw higher up. When one can no longer see, one can at least know.</p>
<p>And so it is with us. As we climb the mountains of our lives, we gain strength and testimony. As we descend, we are better prepared for the next summit, the next test. We can face our new challenge with the assurance of what we have learned.&nbsp;<br /><br />My sweet brothers and sisters I love you. The Lord loves you. I love working with you, learning about you, and sharing in your challenges. I marvel at your strength and your integrity. Do you face trials you did not create? Then reach upward and trust in God to help you endure or overcome. Do you face trials of your own making? Then repent and bring your life back into harmony with gospel principles. Know that our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ, love you. Know that there are many people around you who love you. There are angels to bear you up. Be an angel in the life of someone else. Strengthen and lift and guide and direct as others have guided you. We need each other. We must hold hands and strengthen each other.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the April 2013 Conference, Elder Stanley G. Ellis stated, "Think of it brothers and sisters--we are not spiritual orphans! We are not alone." None of us are "stray mites of humanity" in the eyes of our Heavenly Father. He is our Father. He knows each of us. He loves us eternally--I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I have a simple question for you today:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>What do you want?</em>&nbsp; I don't mean what should you want, rather what do you really want?&nbsp; What do you think about most?&nbsp; What most influences the decisions you make?&nbsp; What are your predominate desires?<br /><br /><strong>President Monson and the Best of Times</strong><br />In a recent meeting with general authorities President Thomas S. Monson talked about you.&nbsp; He talked only about you.&nbsp; He expressed both his admiration and concern for you.&nbsp; He said that you are special and speaking about the times in which you live he borrowed these familiar lines:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.<br />It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.<br />It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.<br />It was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness.<br />It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.<br />We had everything before us, we had nothing before us.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Charles Dickens penned these words to describe life in France and England in 1775 but they describe even better the conditions of our day. President Monson said that you need to know that "this season is not the season of despair but the season of hope, and that you are on the threshold of great accomplishments in the kingdom of (your) Heavenly Father."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;True to the charge the Prophet of the Lord gave to me I hope to help you understand how your time is the best of times depending on what you want and what you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Fullness of Times</strong><br />Our day is unlike any time before.&nbsp; We have so much more, so much more of both good and evil than any day before.&nbsp;&nbsp; From one extreme to the other, we live in the dispensation of the fullness of times both as to evil as well as for good.&nbsp; Unlike any other time, "everything is before us", the full spectrum from the depths of darkness and evil to supernal splendor, brilliance, beauty, magnificence, grandeur, glory and exaltation and everything in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven [things of eternal value], where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Never in the history of the world has this instruction to pursue the ultimate treasures of eternal&nbsp;value been more critical or more timely than today.&nbsp; Never has it been easier to get lost in little things.&nbsp; Never has there been a time in which more has been available than now, more goods, more gadgets, events, shows, choices, activities, alternatives and especially more information and more misinformation than ever before.&nbsp; We call most of those things "diversions" and rightly so, because in fact they divert us from things of greatest importance.&nbsp; In such a flood of information and things, the challenge is not only sift between good and evil, rather sort between the mundane and the monumental as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Never has there been a time more crucial than now to understand the best of all human conditions and the ultimate of all human achievements to which we should all aspire.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The River of Almost No Return</strong><br />Ten years ago my wife and I, along with two of our sons had an experience that burned into my soul the reality that&nbsp;<em>there is precious little in this life that matters very much, but there are a few things that are monumentally important.</em><br /><br />On February 12, 2003 we are in a raft careening down a canyon river in Chile.&nbsp; The dark river roars in our ears as we straddle either side of the raft and paddle with our might at the command of our guide.&nbsp; The wet suits are essential to protect us from the mean splash of the numbing cold water which was snow only three days before.&nbsp; There are four other people and the river guide.&nbsp; His name is Joe.&nbsp; He has thirty years of experience running the Colorado in the Grand Canyon and many other rivers around the world.&nbsp; He has run this particular stretch of the Maipo River hundreds of times without a mishap.&nbsp; We think it safe enough and so here we are, the worst of the rapids are behind and we are loving life as we approach the take-out point.&nbsp; And then it happens.&nbsp; Suddenly, the right side of the raft rises straight up into the sky.&nbsp; Our two sons who were straddling and paddling the right side are launched over our heads into the water, and the large raft flips over dumping us all into the raging river.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is dark and incredibly cold. Underwater the roar of the river is muffled.&nbsp; There are only the muted sounds mostly of the river mixed with the chaos of people on top of people kicking and thrashing about trying to reach the surface.&nbsp; I expect to surface but I don't.&nbsp; The river holds me down.&nbsp; I think I am not going to surface, but I think of Jacque, Chase and Zach more than my need for air.&nbsp; I know that we are in death's firm grasp and feel it squeezing life from me.&nbsp; I feel profound regret for putting my family at such risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Then I hear the full roar of the river.&nbsp; I am finally above water.&nbsp; I gasp for air, desperately looking for my wife and sons, but I don't see them.&nbsp; I am in another dimension.&nbsp; Everything is happening so fast and yet it seems to be happening in slow motion as though in a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In seconds I am pulled under the water again but not before I see that I am headed toward a large rock where the force of the current turns the river back onto itself in a hydraulic roller.&nbsp; I try to get my legs in front of me to take the brunt of the impact but before I hit the rock the roller turns me back, over and under and then spits me out to the side into an eddy.&nbsp; I see Chase and Zach in the same eddy along with Jessica one of the other members of our group.&nbsp; She is from Germany.&nbsp; But where is Jacque?&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; I am frantic to find her.&nbsp; Everyone else, everything else is gone, out of sight down river.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I will stop the story here because there is not time to tell it all.&nbsp; The rest of the story includes the miraculous rescue of my wife Jacque who was saved by the powers of heaven and a kayaker named Sim&oacute;n.&nbsp; Repeatedly Jacque grabs the handle on the stern of Sim&oacute;n's kayak while he attempts to paddle her to shore, but each time her strength fails as the river rips her grip away and pulls her down and under again and again.&nbsp; When her strength is exhausted and she can try no more a force lifts her up and over the back of the kayak and Sim&oacute;n paddles her to shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I am not here to advocate high adventure or risk and certainly not recklessness, rather I want you to understand what the river taught me that day. Problems come and go.&nbsp; Difficulties, inconveniences, disappointments come and go.&nbsp; Even life comes and goes.&nbsp; There isn't much that matters greatly in this life, but there are a few things that are monumentally important, even more important than life.&nbsp; I want to talk about some of those things.&nbsp; I also want you to understand that the few things that are truly important are equally available to all of you whatever your circumstances or past may be.&nbsp; No one is disadvantaged and no one is privileged in regard to what matters most.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>What do you want and what matters most?</strong><br />So<em>, what do you want and what matters most?</em>&nbsp;Hopefully you have identified in your mind the one, two or three things that occupy most of your thoughts, your predominant desires.&nbsp; What do you really want?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord said:&nbsp; "For my thoughts&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;not your thoughts, neither&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;your ways my ways, saith the LORD.&nbsp; For&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; While this may be understood as a declaration that we cannot comprehend the thoughts and ways of God, I think rather it is an invitation to think differently, to elevate your thoughts and, consequently, your ways to coincide with the thoughts and ways of God.&nbsp; He is inviting us to think like He thinks.And so, what are they, the thoughts and ways of the Lord?&nbsp; What are the most important things, to which we should aspire?&nbsp; There is not time to talk about all of them.&nbsp; I will mention only four.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Most Important Thing</strong><br />The first is the most important thing.&nbsp; Of all that you know, and of all of the information and all of the knowledge available to mankind through the internet, or in books, encyclopedias or documents in all the libraries of the world combined,&nbsp;is there something that surpasses all other things in importance?&nbsp; And if so, would it be important to know what it is?&nbsp; And if there is something that is more important than all other things, and if we knew what it was, would it be important to remember it and to give it the highest priority in our lives?&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma says that there is something that is most important.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold,&nbsp;<em>there is one thing which is of more importance than they all</em>--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And behold, he shall be born of Mary...(and) she...shall... bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he will take upon him death, and he will take upon him their infirmities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[He will] take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Do you remember the ultimate objective of all father Lehi saw in his visionary dream?&nbsp; It was a tree, a tree that "<em>is precious above all and the most joyous to the soul</em>"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>, a tree "<em>whose fruit is most precious and most desirable above all other fruits [the most important thing]; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of God</em>."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The tree is a representation of Christ and the fruits are the blessings of His Atonement. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The most important thing is to partake of the fruit of the tree of life, that is, to be&nbsp;<em>forgiven of your sins and endowed with the power of the Holy Ghost</em>. The gifts of the Atonement, to be forgiven of your sins and to be endowed with God's power, coupled with the gift of eternal life are the greatest of all the gifts of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>You should want to receive those gifts more than anything else.&nbsp; They are the most important.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><strong><br /></strong><strong>Hear and Follow the Word of the Lord</strong><br />Next, we should want to hear and follow the word of the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />On one occasion, Jesus:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.&nbsp; And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and&nbsp;<em>heard his word</em>.&nbsp; But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?&nbsp; bid her therefore that she help me.&nbsp; And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:&nbsp; But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>This was not a question of right and wrong, rather good and better, or better and best.&nbsp; What Martha was doing was a good thing, but she had a tendency to become distracted by good things at the expense of the best things.&nbsp; In response to her complaint, the Lord made this astonishing statement, "one thing is needful," that is, to hear and follow the word of the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A study performed at New York University reveals how much we are affected by our environment--even unconsciously.&nbsp; Students were placed in one of two groups.&nbsp; Each student was given a list of seemingly random words from which they were to form meaningful sentences.&nbsp; The only difference between the two groups was that the scrambled set of words for the first group included words associated with old age such as&nbsp;<em>forgetful, bald, gray</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>wrinkle</em>&nbsp;but explicit words like&nbsp;<em>old</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>elderly</em>&nbsp;were not included.&nbsp; It was only an implied or subliminal theme.&nbsp; The words given to the second group did not include words associated with age.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When they completed the task they were sent to another room down the hall.&nbsp; The walk to the other room was what the experiment was really all about.&nbsp; The researchers inconspicuously measured the time it took for the unsuspecting students to go from one room to the other.&nbsp; The students who fashioned sentences from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others.&nbsp; All of this happened unconsciously.&nbsp; Their behavior was affected unconsciously by exposure to an idea.&nbsp; When the students of the first group were questioned afterward, none of them detected a common theme much less would they acknowledge that their behavior had been affected unconsciously by the words they encountered.&nbsp; But it had been.&nbsp; This phenomenon of influencing behavior by an idea is called "priming."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, if your thoughts and behavior can be affected by something as harmless as the implied idea of old age, how much more the effect of explicit images on how you think and act?&nbsp; More than you imagine, and most of it is unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And think about this astonishing statement of Alma:&nbsp; "...the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea,&nbsp;<em>it [the word of God] had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else...</em>"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp; This is a profoundly important truth.&nbsp; If your thoughts and behavior can be affected by something as benign as the implied idea of old age, how much more the effect of the word of God that has a more powerful effect on your mind, how you think, than the sword, which is the threat or fear of death, or anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord says that your thoughts are not His thoughts, but here they are.&nbsp; [Held up the scriptures<em>.</em>] The Holy Scriptures, the teachings of living prophets and the promptings of the Holy Ghost are the thoughts of God and they are more powerful than fear of death, more powerful than addictions, pornography or anything else.&nbsp; It stands to reason, therefore, that the Lord would say: "...treasure up in your minds continually the words of life."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you understand that the Lord is not talking about just reading the scriptures but rather adopting His words to govern your life all of the time, so that they become the standard works--the standard for your works. &nbsp;As you do so His thoughts will become your thoughts and His ways will become your ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>You should want to hear and follow His word.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>A Godly Character&shy;</strong><br />Third, we should want to become like the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord says, "And behold, all things are written by the Father; therefore out of the books which shall be written shall the world be judged," and then He poses the ultimate question:&nbsp; "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?&nbsp; Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp; You see, as you "hear and follow the word of the Lord" you become more like Him.&nbsp; Little by little the qualities and attributes of His character become a part of your character, a part of who you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The question is not how much you can get away with in this life or how close to the line you can walk and still be good, rather the ultimate question is, "who are you and who are you in the process of becoming?"&nbsp; Don't walk the line and don't walk in the middle.&nbsp;<em>You should want to become like Him.</em><em><br /></em><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fruitful</strong><br />Finally we should want to make a difference. We should want to be fruitful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Sermon on the Mount is the greatest sermon ever given in the history of mankind.&nbsp; It is not a random collection of truths, but rather a carefully orchestrated sermon which leads to an important conclusion.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord describes a process beginning with the recognition that we are poor in His spirit which in turn may cause us to mourn for our sins, focus on that of eternal value, be filled with the Holy Ghost, then avoid all that would offend the Spirit and stand firm against adversity all to the end that we that we become the "salt of the earth"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>, the "light of the world", a "city set upon a hill"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of the sermon He returns to this same conclusion to be fruitful:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye shall know them by their fruits. Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of the Father's plan is not only that we be redeemed of sin and endowed with power from on high, but that by the power of the Holy Ghost we become good trees and make a difference in the lives of others especially by helping others to partake of the fruits of the tree of life as well, the most important thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>What do you want?</strong><br />So, again, what do you want? What are your highest aspirations?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What should you want?&nbsp; What should drive you?&nbsp; What should you think about most?&nbsp; What should be your dominate desires?&nbsp; What should influence most the decisions you make every day?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />First, you should want the most important thing which is to partake of the fruit of the tree of life, to partake of the fruits of the Atonement.&nbsp; You should want to be forgiven of your sins and endowed with the power of the Holy Ghost, and qualify for eternal life.&nbsp; That is the most important thing of all.&nbsp;<br /><br />You should want to hear and follow the word of the Lord.&nbsp; You should want to become like Him.&nbsp; You should want to be fruitful, to make a difference in the lives of others especially by helping others partake of the fruit of the tree of life as well, the most important thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These should be your dominate desires and highest aspirations and you should be willing to pay any price to achieve them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>No one is disadvantaged</strong><br />In regard to the few things that matter most in this life, as for everything that is most important, no one is at a disadvantage.&nbsp; Everyone is on equal footing.&nbsp; The greatest gifts are equally available to everyone.&nbsp; This is surprising because there is otherwise so much inequality in this life.&nbsp; Some are rich and others poor.&nbsp; Some are healthy and strong and others not.&nbsp; Some are tall and others are short.&nbsp; Some are popular and others not so. Some have the privileges of education and others don't.&nbsp; But in the end it does not matter how well liked you are, or how much money you acquire, or how beautiful you may be.&nbsp; It does not matter if you win the lottery or get the biggest piece of pie.&nbsp; The greatest gifts are equally available to everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In every other endeavor we are disparately advantaged or disadvantaged, but in regard to the most important things, everything that really matters there is no disparity.&nbsp; No one is disadvantaged.&nbsp; All have absolutely the same access to what is most important.&nbsp; No more and no less than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />It is not complicated.&nbsp; Seek the best things and work tirelessly to achieve them.&nbsp; You can.&nbsp; We all can.&nbsp; Elevate your thoughts to coincide with the Lord's thoughts, that His ways become your ways.&nbsp; Don't drift or become distracted by either the things of the world or the honors of men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Your future is bright.&nbsp; "Be of good cheer and do not fear."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>There is precious little in this life that matters very much, but there are a few things that are monumentally important and they are equally available to everyone.</em>&nbsp; Seek after those things and your time will be the best of times, the age of wisdom, the epoch of belief, the season of light, and the spring of hope.&nbsp; Everything is before you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>All you have to do is choose the best</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that Jesus is the Christ and He invites "all to come unto Him and partake of His goodness every one, (everything that is most important) and He denieth none that come unto Him.&nbsp; All are alike unto God."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_18_Corbridge.htm#_edn18" target="_self">18</a></sup><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bio not available</p>
<p></p>
<p>I once read a story about a place called the Cave of Truth. A group of students heard about it. The name intrigued them because they yearned for truth. They inquired about its location, obtained a map, and then set out in search of the cave. After a long and difficult journey they arrived at a deep cavern near the top of a high mountain.<br /><br />At the entrance sat an old man guarding the way. They approached him and asked if this was the place they had heard about--if it really was the Cave of Truth. He assured them that it was. They asked if they could go in. "Of course," he said, "But first I need to know how deeply into the cave you want to go?" At this question they withdrew and had a discussion among themselves. Then they returned and said, "Well, we would like to enter and go in at least far enough that we can say we have been here."&nbsp;<br /><br />So it was with Naaman. He heard of a prophet in Israel who could heal. After a long and difficult journey from Syria to Samaria he came and stood at Elisha's door. He was prepared to pay ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold to be healed (or for truth as it were). But when the prophet sent a servant to instruct him what to do he became angry and<em>&nbsp;"turned and went away."</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_25_Howard.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Similarly, Moses invited the children of Israel to know God. But they hardened their hearts and chose to not accept the higher law and the truth associated with it.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_25_Howard.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus asked the multitude mourning the death of the daughter of Jairus to believe. "They laughed him to scorn."&nbsp; So he put them all out and only Peter, James and John, and the girl's believing parents were privileged to see her raised from the dead. Those outside were unaware of what occurred within.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_25_Howard.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />And once the prophet Joseph called Sidney Rigdon and Parley P. Pratt to help him recruit "the young and the middle aged" to be part of the Zion Camp march. After the recruiting was over, Parley joined Joseph in the march to Missouri.&nbsp; Sidney didn't.&nbsp; He chose not to go. He missed out on the truth and testimony that he could have had and his decision would haunt him forever.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_25_Howard.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />And so it is with you. There is so much accumulated wisdom at this university. It is a great repository of truth. You are in constant contact with wonderful teachers who know the gospel well. You are so surrounded by excellence and knowledge that you probably take them for granted.&nbsp; But how far into the cave do you want to go?&nbsp;<br /><br />And how do you know if you have gone far enough? How do you know if your faith is strong enough? How do any of us know if we are humble enough, or submissive enough, or home enough, or if we have loved enough?&nbsp;<br /><br />And what if the cave were the "Cave of Testimony"? What if we go in half-heartedly or turn back just past the doorway because the way is narrow and the light is dim? How do we know if we have gone in far enough? To borrow a metaphor from childhood, how do we know whether our testimony is built of straw, sticks or bricks?&nbsp;<br /><br />These are important questions because testimony is the house we build to shelter us from the storm. And we can't afford to kid ourselves by standing in the entryway saying, "We have been there!" or "Don't worry. I will always have a testimony" or "My testimony is as strong as anyone else's," or "I don't need to go on a mission to have a testimony."&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that each of us here today has a testimony of, or at least a belief in, the truthfulness of the gospel. So let's talk about our testimonies.&nbsp;<br /><br />Testimony is one of the most used (and sometimes misused) words in the Church. It is not a scriptural term. The scriptural word, and perhaps a better one, is witness. A witness is one who testifies. Testimony is what a witness says.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I have worried about strengthening testimony it has been helpful to look to my experience as a lawyer. In the courts there are essentially three kinds of witnesses.</p>
<p>1. Eyewitnesses - who testify about what they have seen or heard;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2. Expert witnesses - who testify on the basis of their study or experience; and<br />3. Parties to a legal action - These are witnesses who, on a limited basis, are allowed to testify about how they felt when something happened to them. They may have been injured or felt pain. They&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;that they have been hurt. But in a court of law, a jury will not be allowed to give much credence to their testimony because it is considered to be self-serving and is difficult to corroborate.There are similar kinds of witnesses in the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />1. There are eyewitnesses - who testify of what they have seen or heard.&nbsp; In the Church, however, those who have seen don't always testify. There are those on earth, (and I say this in all seriousness) who have seen God or have experienced the ministering of angels and do not speak about it. Not because the experience is secret or would not stand scrutiny, but rather because it is so sacred and personal that it cannot be shared without the permission of the one who gave it to them. It is not theirs to give again.&nbsp; Let me give you an illustration.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I practiced law one of my partners was Marion G. Romney's son. His grand father George Samuel Romney was once president of this university. Marion G. was then in the First Presidency of the Church. One day my friend and I spoke of deeply spiritual things. We wondered, as perhaps some of you have, how many people in the history of the world had seen the Savior. I remember saying that if anyone on earth at the time had, it would most likely be President Romney.&nbsp;<br /><br />I said to my partner, "Have you ever asked him?" "No. Not really," he replied. I said, "Why don't you? You are his son. He will surely tell&nbsp;<em>you</em>." He thought a moment and said, "All right, I will. We have a family home evening scheduled with dad next Sunday night. If the opportunity presents itself I'll ask him."&nbsp;<br /><br />I could scarcely wait for the week to end. The following Monday, early in the morning, I stood in the doorway of his office and said, "Well?" "Well what?" he asked. "Well. Did you ask him?"&nbsp; I said. "Come in and close the door," he replied. I went in and sat down.He laughed and said, "Yes. I did ask him. And do you know what he said to me--his own son?" "Tell me," I said. "Well, when I asked him if he had ever seen the Savior my father just looked at me and said, 'Not to speak of son. Not to speak of.'"&nbsp;<br /><br />If we seek this kind of testimony, we are likely to be disappointed. Just as it would be a mistake to believe that if you haven't seen something, then no one else has either; so also it is a mistake to believe that you can have a Burning Bush or Sacred Grove kind of experience just because Moses or Joseph did. Those who do, attempt to counsel the Lord and fail to realize that, as C.S. Lewis once wrote, "It would be rash to say that there is any prayer which God never grants. But the strongest candidate is the prayer we might express in the single word "<em>encore</em>."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_25_Howard.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />2. There are also expert witnesses in the Church - Those who testify about what they know from study or experience. In reality though, in the Church there are two kinds of expert witness - the false and the true.&nbsp;<br /><br />The false are those who attempt to prove spiritual things by secular scholarship. These are sometimes the authors of books about the last days, or the self-appointed researchers of old journals who seek to explain sacred temple ordinances, or clarify what it means to have one's calling and election made sure. They seem to want to force the disclosure of spiritual truth and get a testimony by the power of their own intellects or reason. In this they will always fail.&nbsp;<br /><br />The other kind of expert witness in the Church is the one who after much study and prayer has come to understand the revelations and to be taught by the Spirit. This university is full of such witnesses. The General Authorities all stand as such witnesses. Even the rest of us, the most ordinary members of the Church, after sincere searching will be taught by the Spirit and can know and testify about spiritual truth. Again, if you will forgive a personal reference, let me give you an example.&nbsp;<br /><br />For more than forty years I travelled the world. After I was called as a General Authority, I began to be concerned about our three younger children. There were times when I was not home much and I knew they needed to spend more time with their father.&nbsp; So one family home evening I announced a new grand bargain. If they would keep the rules, help their mother when I was gone, get to bed on time, and do their home work, once a year I would take each of them individually with me on assignment. At my own expense--anywhere in the world I was going, they could each come with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh my! Were they excited? Did I really mean it? Anywhere? They wanted my schedule and began to plan their trips. And they knew where they wanted to go. They began alphabetically: Alaska, the headwaters of the Amazon, Anaheim, California, etc.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the time our son Paul was twelve years old. He was gifted athletically but not spiritually. He had never born his testimony. I wondered if he ever would. But he decided that he wanted to go with me to Mexico. I told him he could but that he would have to bear his testimony there. He said, "Then I won't go."&nbsp;<br /><br />I had a scheduled conference in Mexico City. As the date drew near my son again asked if he could go with me. I said, "Sure. But you will have to bear your testimony." He was adamant, "Then I won't go."&nbsp;<br /><br />The time came to order the tickets; again he asked if he had to talk. I said yes. He said, "Does it have to be in Spanish?" I said, "Yes." He sighed and reluctantly said, "O.K." I called the mission president. He also had a twelve-year-old son. He agreed to pick us up at the airport and drive us to the conference. The boys could keep each other company.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the meetings was in Celaya. The road we took was narrow and wound through the mountains.&nbsp; As we started down the steep incline into town, the president suddenly braked the car. The road was blocked with a huge pile of logs and branches that had fallen from a rickety cart ahead of us. A woodcutter and his two sons were frantically trying to clear the road and reload their cart.&nbsp; My son said, "Good! Now I don't have to talk."&nbsp;<br /><br />We shut off the car. We chatted a bit. The logjam didn't seem to be moving. Someone suggested that maybe we should help, so we did. And a kind of camaraderie developed on that mountain road between our sons, dressed in white shirts and ties, and the two barefoot wood gatherers. It just happened as bark filled their hair and sawdust covered their clothes. It took us about thirty minutes to pick up and restack the wood.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we finished, we said goodbye to our new friends, cleaned up as well as we could, and drove to Celaya. At a convenient moment in the conference I called on my son to bear his testimony. He stood behind the little pulpit and in gringo Spanish haltingly said, "<em>Yo se que el Libro de Morm&oacute;n es verdadero, porque lo he le&iacute;do."</em><em><br /></em><br />It was true. He knew the Book of Mormon was true because he had read it--in Spanish!&nbsp; In painful, two verse at a time, early morning scripture study that our family had conducted for years, in English, and Spanish, and Portuguese, he had read it and he knew it was true. And to me what happened to my son Paul on that road to Celaya was just as important as what happened to his namesake Paul on the road to Damascus. And his testimony was just as valid.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. There are also personal witnesses in the Church - Those of us who testify about what we feel. Just as in the courts, our feelings are often incapable of convincing others, but we know what we feel, and are willing to act upon it to the extent that we change our lives, pay tithing, go on missions, and do other things that people with testimonies do.&nbsp;<br /><br />Personal witness doesn't depend on visions or miraculous events. Its origin is, and will always be, the still small voice.&nbsp; It is the foundation for greater spiritual experiences that come from time to time, usually unbidden, after our faith and obedience have been demonstrated.&nbsp;<br /><br />But when our testimonies are based on what we feel, we will always need to be vigilant because, unless we are living the gospel well enough so as to have the Holy Ghost as a reasonably constant companion, feelings can sometimes lead us astray. It is easy to confuse wants and desires with spiritual promptings and many a young man in the Church has confused infatuation with a "burning in the bosom."&nbsp;<br /><br />And even though you might&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;otherwise, the Holy Spirit will never say, "You know enough. Your testimony is strong enough. You have read the scriptures enough. You've been to the cave, now you can rest."&nbsp;<br /><br />As Mark Twain reportedly said,&nbsp; "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."So I need to share another story about things we most certainly believe that are sometimes not true. A number of years ago I had an assignment to accompany President Spencer W. Kimball to a regional conference. We had many meetings. After the conference a lovely dinner was held in the Prophet's honor. Eighteen stake presidents and their wives, together with a few others were in attendance. We were assembled in a large banquet room with tables covered with white linen arranged in a square. I was seated about as far from the head table as you could get. My seatmate was a long time friend Jerry Cahill who represented the public affairs department of the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />The master of ceremonies made a few remarks and turned the time over to the prophet. President Kimball rose to his feet, thanked everyone for their hospitality and then said, " I think I would like to hear from you. Would a representative of each of the couples please stand and tell me a little about yourselves, your families, and your experience in the Church."&nbsp;<br /><br />As the president was giving these instructions Brother Cahill whispered to me, "This is going to be so great! I was with him in another conference when he did this. I have never been in a more spiritual meeting in my life. After they are through speaking President Kimball will stand again and say, 'Now let me introduce myself to you. My name is Spencer W. Kimball.&nbsp; Some say I am a prophet of God. Let me tell you a few things that have touched my soul today.'"&nbsp;<br /><br />Just then the master of ceremonies jumped to his feet and took the microphone from the prophet. He was certain he knew what God wanted. He was certain that he knew what would be best for the stake presidents and their wives.&nbsp;<br /><br />He said, "O we don't want to do that President. We can listen to them any time. We want to hear from you." President Kimball looked at him for a moment and said, "I think I'm feeling a little tired. I believe I would like to go to my room now."&nbsp;<br /><br />And while that master of ceremonies may have had a testimony of the gospel, he didn't have a testimony of obedience. Like Sidney Rigdon, he didn't know what it meant to sit at the feet of a prophet, and his certainty that he knew what the Prophet wanted, kept him from hearing what the Lord might otherwise have taught him.&nbsp;<br /><br />So how can we be sure that the Holy Ghost has prompted us, or whether our feelings have caused us to believe something that just isn't so? How do we know our testimonies are strong enough? I think that just asking the question helps. And it helps to remember that the only thing that keeps us from knowing more is the false certainty that we know enough.&nbsp;<br /><br />4. I also need to speak briefly about another kind of witness in the Church, the special or especial witness. Long before I was called to the Seventy, even as long ago as when I was your age, I wondered what it meant to be a "special" or an "especial" witness.When I became a general authority I tried to understand what was expected of me as such a witness. I decided (and this was just my thought) that it meant that I should first be a faithful agent of the Savior and of the First Presidency and the Twelve. Then, that I should do, as well as I possibly could, the things that I had been asked to do; to teach, as well as I possibly could, the things given me to teach; and, to testify,&nbsp;<em>under the direction of the Spirit</em>, of&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of the things, that I had seen and heard.&nbsp;<br /><br />In that spirit, with you my young brethren and sisters, I would like share a little part of my especial witness that I have never spoken about before.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years ago, I received an assignment from the First Presidency to incorporate the Church in all of the countries of the western hemisphere. In the spring of one year I flew to El Salvador. At my own expense I took Sister Howard with me. We were looking for a lawyer to draft articles of incorporation and to help us register the Church in that land.&nbsp; We went to the U.S. Embassy hoping they would recommend someone but instead were given a long list of almost one hundred attorneys with international corporate experience and no recommendation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Leaving the embassy, we went out and stood on the sidewalk and read through the three-page list. About halfway through the second page we saw the name Jose Enrique Rivera. We could pronounce it. He seemed to be as good a candidate as any. We found a taxi and gave the driver the address of his office in the Pan American Building.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was a time of civil unrest in El Salvador. When we arrived at the address we found the building in ruins. It was bombed, blackened, and empty. There was no forwarding address. I was disappointed and began to leaf through the list looking for another lawyer.My wife asked me what I was doing. When I told her she said, "but what if you were inspired to pick his name the first time?" I didn't want to admit that I wasn't so we went to a neighboring store and asked what had happened to the Pan American building and it's tenants. We were met with suspicion. "How should I know?" the proprietor said. After several inquiries in several places, we finally found someone who thought Mr. Rivera had moved into a building in a distant part of the city.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was like looking for a needle in a haystack. I grumbled that a lawyer was a lawyer and that anyone on the list could do the job equally as well. My wife ignored me. It took us the better part of the day to locate Jose Enrique Rivera. We finally did. We walked into his office unannounced in the early evening and asked for an appointment. I explained to a secretary what we wanted. She asked us to have a seat. We did.&nbsp;<br /><br />Latin lawyers are not noted for receiving their clients promptly and I expected that it would be midnight before he would see us. However, within five minutes we were ushered into his office. I introduced myself and explained what we needed. He reached into the lower right hand drawer of his desk and pulled out a complete ready to record set of Articles of Incorporation for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; We were stunned!&nbsp;<br /><br />Mr. Rivera explained that a few years before he met a missionary on a plane who told him that eventually the Church would come to El Salvador. He had felt impressed to draft some articles. When they were finished he kept them in his drawer feeling that someday someone would want them.&nbsp;<br /><br />And any time I am discouraged or wonder if God is in his heaven or if he is aware of his children or their needs, I look back on that afternoon and know that all is well and that He is in charge. If He wants me to know more He will tell me. If he wants to endure more, I pray that I may in some small measure rise to his expectations. To sum it up:&nbsp;<br /><br />We all start our lives with borrowed testimonies. But these will not sustain us when rain and floods come and beat upon us, as they surely will.&nbsp; The storms will come whether we have built upon a rock or upon the sand. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To build a stronger testimony, we need to emulate Abraham. We must want to know more and be better.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_06_25_Howard.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp; We must be desirous of having spiritual adventures and actively seek out opportunities for adventuring. We need to go into the cave as far as we can go. (And that is the principal reason you are here on this campus)&nbsp;<br /><br />But we must have our own adventures and experiences, not someone else's, or testimony will not long withstand the storm.To keep a testimony, we must cultivate an eagerness of soul that hopes for things not yet felt, and discovers spiritual depths in ordinary tasks and errands. (For that is where testimony is most often found)&nbsp;<br /><br />And remember that certainty is sometimes incompatible with learning. After all it was uncertainty that allowed the heavens to part, that spring morning in the Grove.&nbsp;<br /><br />And we must realize that faith is the power that enables us to venture beyond the bounds of past experience, piercing the walls of certainty that surround us just enough that we can glimpse and then slip through to a brighter understanding of things we have never known before.&nbsp;<br /><br />May we so live!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus Member, First Quorum of the Seven</p>
<p>Bio not available</p>
<p></p>
<p>An observer who had seen World War II up close in the Philippines said: "There are no atheists in the foxholes."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a>&nbsp;</sup>Even though I wasn't in one of those foxholes, I have no reason to doubt that observation. Most people believe in God, but there are a growing number of non-believers of various kinds around. It will not surprise you to find that I count myself among the believers. I'll try to answer the question of how I came to be one and some of the keys to finding and retaining faith.<br /><br />I was raised in a home of faith where it was accepted as fact that God governed the universe and we were all children of a Heavenly Father that loved us. My parents and my grandparents all believed in God. At a very young age I experienced my first direct answer to a prayer on a matter important to me. Thus I had no other thought in my youth than that God lived, a God that had a personal interest in all of His children.&nbsp;<br /><br />I carried this faith into the first years of my life as a college student at the University of California at Santa Barbara. About that time, however, a philosophy class opened challenges and raised issues about the very existence of God. About this same time, I faced the decision of whether to take a leave of absence from college to serve a mission. To add to the dilemma the Korean War commenced with its disquieting influence on my generation. I wrestled with the issue of God, not exactly doubting, but thinking more deeply about it. I loved the Church, but being somewhat analytical developed a list of doctrinal and policy issues and concerns to which I wanted to find answers. For me the list was somewhat lengthy and formidable.&nbsp;<br /><br />What carried the day on the question of leaving college to serve a mission was probably a feeling of trust in my parents' and my grandparents' viewpoint on the existence of God and Jesus Christ together with a feeling that there was good and evil in the world and the Church was a source of light, goodness, and truth. I was drawn somehow to that feeling of goodness, not then knowing its source, but despite my decision to serve I wanted to know more and I wanted to find answers to my concerns. Reading the Book of Mormon gave me enough assurance to go on, but it also made me realize how much I didn't know and gave me a thirst to want to know more, much more. If I am right some of you may have had somewhat similar experiences to mine. My concerns were not completely resolved as I entered the mission home in Salt Lake City, today's equivalent of the MTC. That period in the mission home answered one of the most basic issues I faced: does God still speak to the Church today? Is the Church guided by revelation from God?&nbsp;<br /><br />The teachers at the mission home were mostly General Authorities of the Church. One of them was Elder Joseph F. Merrill of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. A noted Ph.D. scholar in physics, he had been a professor at the University of Utah before his call to the Twelve in 1931, the year I was born. He spoke on that very issue and testified to us matter-of-factly with his scientific approach that revelation has continued in and guided the Church. When he allowed questions, one elder asked Elder Merrill: "When did the Church receive the last revelation from God?" Elder Merrill answered quickly and emphatically, "Last Thursday in the Salt Lake Temple."&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Merrill then paused a moment in thought, and added: "We expect President Don Colton (the mission president), to come through the door at the end of the hour, is that right?" President Colton's approach was to introduce each speaker at the beginning of the hour and then return to introduce the next speaker at the end of the hour. We were in the middle of Elder Merrill's hour and thus did not expect President Colton. Elder Merrill said simply: "President Colton will shortly enter the room." The door almost immediately opened and President Colton entered with a message for one of the missionaries. Elder Merrill had calmly received a message from above and we all knew it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I entered my first assignment in northern Montana with enthusiasm, but also full of desire to know more. I read everything about the gospel I could get my hands on, and especially the scriptures which I read over and over until my eyes were sore. Over the next couple of months, I found answers to virtually all of my questions, enough so that I felt complete assurance that there were answers to all of my fundamental questions. We never in this life get to know everything, but I knew enough and had enough experience by then that my testimony had become firm. It has never left me, even though I still have things I would like to more fully understand. I felt sorry for my first companion who had to put up with all of my probing and searching. The result of this early experience was personally helpful and powerful. Study and reasoning had confirmed the feelings of the heart that caused me to volunteer for missionary service.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you undoubtedly know, and as I was finding out, there are more ways than one to learn spiritual truths. One of them is by study and reason. Section 109 of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants advised us to "seek wisdom out of the best books."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;We are further admonished to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom...that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the Kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand; of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Wow! The scope of that admonition is breathtaking. That is a call to a lifetime of study and reasoning for each of us to undertake and follow.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus we see that it is good to know as much as we can know about these things. But the greater way to know the things of God is through the heart. I already knew what I needed to know before I began my missionary service, because I had those feelings of my heart I earlier described. The great mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal, grappled not only with mathematics, but with spiritual questions. He dealt in probabilities, and came to this conclusion among many others during his thirty-nine years on earth: "It is the heart which experiences God, and not the reason. This, then, is faith: God felt by the heart, not by the reason."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Both study and reason are ways to learn, but we need eventually and as early as possible in our lives to feel things in our hearts. I hadn't paid the price to know enough to answer all my questions during the period I have shared with you, but my heart persuaded me to serve the Lord and in time the answers came. Pascal, who lived from 1623 to 1662, concluded, after thinking deeply about the issue of God, that if we follow our feeling that God exists, and it proves to be true, it will provide infinite-yes, infinite-gains and benefits. We would lose but little if it turned out that God does not exist. Those losses will be finite and as nothing when compared to the gains and benefits that follow from the existence of God. His reasoning is still true today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, what are the sources of knowledge available to us from above? Beyond what we learn from reason and life's experiences, which teach us much, we also know that there is a source of knowledge called the Spirit of Jesus Christ. That Spirit emanates from Christ and "lighteneth every man that cometh into the world."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn5" target="_self">[5]</a>&nbsp;If we are sensitive to know when that Spirit is working with us we can receive personal revelation in the form of feelings and knowledge that come from God. Moroni in the Book of Mormon expanded our understanding of the Spirit of Christ. He taught us that "...the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />He also taught that there is another spirit that persuades men to do evil, and not to believe in Christ, but rather to deny Christ giving license to not serve God.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;This other spirit comes from another powerful source, that of the devil.&nbsp;<br /><br />From the Apostle John's and Moroni's teachings we have learned that if a feeling or spirit persuades us to do good things, it comes from Jesus Christ. If a different spirit that works with us tries to persuade us to disbelieve in God and Christ and to do evil things, we know that this comes from the deceptive source.&nbsp;<br /><br />Section 88 of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants also teaches us that the light of Christ is the light of the sun, and the power by which it is made, and the light of the moon, stars, and the earth and their power. This light enlightens us and quickens our understanding. It proceeds forth from God's presence to fill the immensity of space.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />If we recognize and catch hold of that light and follow it we gain understanding of all things that are important and we will be led to do good continually.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is obvious that the devil leads many astray. The growing disbelief in God and Christ are evidence of that and the result of it. This evil spirit is abroad in the earth&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to the benefits of those teachings about the Spirit of Christ, the Doctrine &amp; Covenants gives us some important clues to follow when we try to discern what spirits are trying to persuade us. Some early disciples of the Church began to receive what they asserted was revelation from God, but which led them onto confusing paths. The Lord gave us help in dealing with and discerning this kind of confusion. After explaining that false spirits were deceiving the world, and even some of the children in the Church, The Lord told the assembled elders of the Church in Kirtland: "...now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church, and let us reason together that ye may understand."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />He then explained that when the elders received the word by the Spirit of Truth both "he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified (that is, built up) and rejoice together."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />He continued, explaining that when the alleged revelation does not edify them, that is to say, does not enlighten, instruct, and built them up, its source "is not of God, and is darkness."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;He went on to explain to the elders: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light growth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp; The perfect day would be that day when we truly know fully that God lives and Jesus is our Savior, independent of all other knowledge and independent of what others know and believe.&nbsp;<br /><br />Notice that this light does not come all at once, but rather step by step, light upon light, line upon line, precept upon precept. And it comes in our hearts so we know it and feel it. This is how we know that what we are receiving is from God and not another source.&nbsp;<br /><br />We also have another and even greater source of learning gospel truths. We again turn to Moroni who explained that if we receive the Book of Mormon and read it, and indeed this is true with all other scriptures, and "ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ, if these things are not true," and if we do it "with a sincere heart having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus we have another source of revelation that teaches us the greater truths of the gospel of Christ and brings them to our remembrance when we need them.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;The Holy Ghost also testifies to us of Christ.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;It comforts us and fills us with peace and knowledge. That is why it is also known as the comforter.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have spoken of the two great sources of knowledge and revelation from God. They are the Spirit of Christ that is given to all men and women to know good from evil and the Holy Ghost which teaches us the gospel and testifies of Christ as our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have also identified a source to avoid. That is the spirit that teaches us to do evil in our lives and persuades us to disbelieve in God and Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have given you a quiet and meaningful way to determine the source of information that comes to us. One source is confusing and dark. It teaches us both to do evil in our lives and disbelieve in God and Christ. The good source builds us, instructs us, enlightens us, and brings us peace and comfort. Importantly it also testifies to us that Jesus is our Savior and that the scriptures are true sources of God's revelation to man.&nbsp;<br /><br />I mention one other warning from the scriptures. It is that we should not seek after signs and wonders for our faith. The Savior taught the people not to be sign seekers while he was on the earth.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;He taught again, in this dispensation, that "he that seeketh signs shall see signs, but not unto salvation."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp; He further taught us that "faith cometh not by signs, but signs follow those that believe."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Book of Mormon, Korihor, an unbeliever, demanded that Alma show him as sign as a condition to his believing in God. After warning him about sign seeking, and letting him know he had signs enough just looking into the universe, Alma gave him the sign of striking him dumb.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Miracles and signs are part of the true Church, but they generally come to people that have faith and when we least expect them. God loves us and helps us in many ways we cannot see, and sometimes gives us a glimpse of His great love. We know in our hearts the truth Psalm 23 teaches: "The Lord is [our] Shepherd...yea, though [we] walk through the valley of the shadow of death, [we] will fear no evil; for thou art with [us]."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />A little over two weeks ago our automobile was struck by another automobile under circumstances that we know we would ordinarily have been killed, but we were saved and truly felt the love and peace of our Shepherd.&nbsp;<br /><br />You, we, and anyone else can know God's love, but I make one last point in parting. You have to want to know enough to exercise just a particle of faith like planting a seed and the Lord will cause the seed to swell and sprout and grow to a magnificent tree of faith.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_02_Carmack.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp; Your knowledge in time can grow to be perfect in that way. But you have to want it. Or, as Rexburg's Seventy Don Clark says, "Ya Gotta Wanta." You have to do your part. We have our good minds to reason, our experiences, and most important, we have the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost to teach us. We thank the Lord for his goodness and mercy to us and share our testimonies as believers in the name of Jesus Christ.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is an honor to be with you this afternoon. I pray the Lord's most choice blessings upon you, your families and your loved ones. You are a fortunate and blessed group.<br /><br />As Sister Shumway and I completed our service in Bolivia, Sister Shumway thought it would be a nice gesture to take Florentina, a mission home employee, along with her five-year-old daughter and another young friend, Aurora, to McDonalds. The young girls had a good time: happy meals, ice cream, and play land. Upon departing, Aurora took the hand of Sister Shumway, looked into her eyes, and said, "Oh Sister Shumway, thank you so much for taking us to McDonalds. I never thought I would have the chance to eat here." Kind of puts the abundance so many of us have in perspective, doesn't it?&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson spoke of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[B]oth abundance and lack of abundance existing simultaneously in our lives, as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend... when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but are grateful for the abundance that is present--love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature, and personal pursuits that bring us happiness--the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience heaven on earth.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>President Monson cites Emily, of Thornton Wilder's&nbsp;<em>Our Town</em>, as she laments, "Do... human beings ever realize life while they live it--every, every minute?"<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It is difficult in this over-scheduled and complex world to keep a proper perspective of how we spend our time and what matters most.To this end, Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, "Someday, when we look back on mortality, we will see that so many of the things that seemed to matter so much at the moment, will be seen not to have mattered at all. And the eternal things will be seen to have mattered even more than the most faithful of the Saints imagined."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Take care to set your heart on the things that matter most, rather than those of little or no importance. Some struggle to reach the top of the ladder only to find that it is leaning against the wrong wall. We live in a world set on a course we must not follow. Keep the Lord at the forefront of your life. Doing so will ensure you are on course. If a change in how you spend your precious mortal time is needed, today is a good time to start. "The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago, the next best time is today."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In making this mortal journey, our covenants play a central role in reminding us of our course, in changing us, and motivating us in our quest for eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Church of covenants. Through sacrifice and obedience to our covenants we gain a proper perspective that brings promised blessings, including that of being accepted of the Lord.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The highest of our covenants are made in the temple. "A temple is literally a house of the Lord... a place where the Lord may come, it is the most holy place of worship on the earth. Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />My hope is that as students of Brigham Young University-Idaho, each of you will keep covenants to be worthy of a temple recommend.A friend told of a time when, as a young mother, her five-year-old daughter inquired, "Mom, who shall I marry?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Although somewhat puzzled by the question coming from such a young child, she thought for a moment and responded, "I believe David is a good boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;"Mom," questioned the small girl, "Does he know the way to the temple?"&nbsp;<br /><br />As years passed David did not know the way to the temple and the righteous daughter married a young man who did know the way. She was sealed in the temple, and now continues to keep her precious covenants and eternal perspective. Covenant with the Lord&nbsp;<em>now</em>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;will marry one who knows the way to the temple. And within marriage, covenant together that you will always remember the way to the temple.&nbsp;<br /><br />Section 109 of the Doctrine and Covenants is the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland, Ohio Temple. According to the Prophet Joseph's written statement, this prayer was given to him by revelation.&nbsp;<br /><br />In verse 8 we are counseled: "Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In this verse we are instructed to establish seven basic fundamentals--fundamentals that provide the foundation necessary to keep promised covenants and be worthy of promised blessings. These fundamentals are a model, an inspiration, a blueprint--for our homes, our families, our lives.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>First, establish a house of prayer.</strong><br />The prophet Enos tells of the wrestle he had before God prior to receiving a remission of his sins. "My soul hungered," he declares, "and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul..."<sup>8</sup><br /><br />You and I cannot attain Enos-like faith without experiencing our own wrestle before God in prayer. Let me assure you, the reward of that wrestle is worth the effort.&nbsp;<br /><br />A treasured friend of mine served his mission in Philadelphia. One day as his companion and he were walking down the street of this large city, they heard the voice of a girl crying to them, "Missionaries, missionaries come quickly, come quickly. My mother is very ill." The voice was that of a young nine-year-old who had recently joined the church along with her mother. The missionaries gave a priesthood blessing and left. Upon returning the following morning the missionaries discovered that the mother was better. Inquiring of the young girl how she knew they would be near her home when so desperately needed, she responded, "When my mom became so ill, I went to my bedroom, I knelt by my bed and I&nbsp;<em>prayed</em>&nbsp;that Heavenly Father would send the missionaries. Then I went to the door and waited." The Savior promises, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock..."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As you establish a house of prayer and "council with the Lord in all [your] doings,"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;the Savior enters your lives and gives aid.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Second, establish a house of fasting.</strong><br />In the Old Testament we learn of generous offerings of the faithful Israelites. When the King of Judah questioned Azariah, the chief priest, regarding the abundance he observed, Azariah responded, "Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the Lord hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I recall a sweet expression of gratitude spoken by a young girl in Trinidad, Bolivia. As I stood to give the concluding remarks at a member district conference, I noticed her in a wheel chair at the back of the chapel. Her name was America Gil. We became friends. She needed expensive surgery to repair damage to her back caused by a childhood disease. She always wore a smile, ever spoke a kind word, and never uttered a complaint. Her family had not the necessary funds to cover needed medical costs. Use of fast offering funds was requested. Approval was given, surgery performed, and thankfulness expressed as she pulled me close to her hospital bed and whispered in my ear, "Please tell the members of the Church thank you for their generous fast offerings, allowing me to have this operation and opportunity to walk again."&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, I say thank you, my dear friends of BYU-Idaho, for your generous fast offerings. I reaffirm Azariah's declaration that as you are generous with your offerings, you will be blessed.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Third, establish a house of faith.</strong><br />Faith is principle of action.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years ago, I was on assignment with President Dieter F. Uchtdorf. He was at that time a member of the Presidency of the Seventy. Being from Germany, he mentioned to me he felt he was on foreign assignment in the United States. He expressed how he looked forward to the day when he would be able to return to his home and family in Germany. Subsequently, of course, he was called into the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and later into the First Presidency, never again to reside in his beloved home. President Uchtdorf's covenants meant more to him than his beloved homeland. So upon his call to the First Presidency, he left his home in Germany to "wear out"<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;the rest of his life in the service of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you keep covenants, fulfill callings, and genuinely seek faith in your&nbsp;<em>own</em>&nbsp;house, the great reward of the Savior's divine gift of redemption can be yours.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fourth, establish a house of learning</strong><br />I am acquainted with a couple from Central America. As members of a different faith, they were concerned when their young son passed away without being baptized. They consulted their minister and were told that the baby would go to limbo. "Where is limbo?" they inquired. The response was that it is believed to be a place of darkness, despair, and hopelessness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Soon after, this couple joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They&nbsp;<em>learned</em>&nbsp;of eternal families and that their son was not in limbo but that he was saved and could be theirs forever. They&nbsp;<em>learned</em>&nbsp;of and were sealed in the temple, receiving great hope, with joy replacing despair. My dear young brothers and sisters, of all the things you can spend time learning, make certain to never stop learning of the Savior and His Gospel.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fifth, establish a house of glory.</strong><br />In the scriptures, glory denotes a manifestation of God's presence.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The temple is a manifestation of God's presence on earth.<sup>14</sup>On one occasion Sister Shumway and I were at the beautiful temple of Cochabamba, Bolivia. Elder and Sister Dallas Jones, from Silver City, New Mexico were the managers of the temple patron housing. A young family had traveled numerous hours to be in the temple. Shortly after showing the family to their room, Brother Jones returned to see how they were. The father was boiling some water.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Are you preparing some soup?" Brother Jones asked.&nbsp;<br /><br />"No," was the response. "We have spent all of our money on transportation and lodging and have none left for food, and we thought hot water would be more nourishing for the children than cold water."&nbsp;<br /><br />Brother and Sister Jones quickly prepared tuna sandwiches. The family was fed, they rested through the night, and the next morning entered into a house of glory where covenants were made and blessings promised through continued faithfulness. Eternal glory is not found in the food we eat, the clothing we wear, or the car we drive. Eternal glory is found in honoring our temple covenants and readily submitting the will of our Father in Heaven. Covenant with the Lord&nbsp;<em>now</em>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;will always remember the way to the temple, that you may feel the manifestation of God's presence and&nbsp;<em>glory</em>.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sixth, establish a house of order</strong><br />"Thanks be to thy name, O Lord God of Israel," prayed Joseph Smith, "who keepest covenant and showest mercy unto thy servants who walk uprightly before thee..."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;As we walk uprightly before our Father in Heaven, striving to keep covenants, and making changes as necessary,&nbsp;<em>order</em>&nbsp;will come to our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the thirty-sixth chapter of Alma we learn the seven steps to repentance.</p>
<p>The power of God is found in His attributes--the only power that Satan has is the power you give him. Satan is happy only when you are disobedient, but he cannot lock you up. You have a key--a key inside yo-u-the key of repentance. How do you know if you are making a mistake? Part of your covenant promises and blessings is that the Holy Ghost will tell you. You must stay worthy. There will be trials. You must know beforehand what your response will be. As you walk uprightly before God, striving to keep covenants, and making changes--repenting--as necessary,&nbsp;<em>order</em>&nbsp;will come.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Seventh, establish a house of God</strong><br />The Lord affirms, "... whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and... it shall be eternally bound in the heavens."<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>The sealing power given by God to man, performed only in&nbsp;<em>His House</em>, is a supreme gift from our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather, Charles Shumway, was a friend of Brigham Young. At Winter Quarters after leaving Nauvoo in the winter of 1846, President Young came to Charles and requested that he be a guide and go ahead of the company. Charles explained to the prophet that his wife had died the night prior and he did not expect his youngest daughter to live through the next day.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Young responded to Charles, "Have you made temple covenants and been sealed to your family?"&nbsp;<br /><br />"Yes," came the reply.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Then what else matters?" asked President Young. "I'll await your answer in the morning."&nbsp;<br /><br />Charles went, leaving behind his ten your old daughter Mary, with her baby sister dying in her arms.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of a house of God, temple ordinances, and this sealing authority, I affirm to you that families can be eternal and that nothing matters more than keeping our covenants and a proper perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />No one will make it through life without challenges. There will be setbacks, roadblocks, and some sorrow. When you face these challenges, remember your covenants. Turn to your covenants. The covenants you have and will make with the Lord will be to you a guide, a protection, and will give courage and aid in keeping the right perspective as challenges arise.&nbsp;<br /><br />I sat one day some fifty years ago, as a young missionary, in the Montevideo, Uruguay mission home, being taught by our mission President, J. Thomas Fyans. He spoke of failure and of success, of Babe Ruth and baseball. I recorded the account as best I remembered it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Thirty-five-thousand fans packed Shibe Park. Lefty (Bob) Grove, one of the greatest left-handed pitchers of all times, had just struck out Babe Ruth on three consecutive pitched balls for the second successive time. Babe went back to the dugout, tipped his hat politely, drank some water, smiled, and sat down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now, the situation was critical. It was near the end of the game, the bottom of the ninth. The Yankees were up to bat and the bases were loaded. Two men were out for the Yankees and the score was three to one in favor of the Athletics, the opposing team.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The excitement was tremendous.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Strike 'im out again," pleaded the fans, as Babe Ruth approached home plate for one final turn at bat.&nbsp;Grove strutted around the pitcher's mound. It was clear that he intended to do just that.&nbsp;He threw the first ball. It was a foul.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Striiiiirike one!" roared the umpire.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Babe got ready for the second pitch. It was too fast. He swung and missed. He swung so hard that he fell to the ground. The crowd was going mad. They loved it. Ruth finally regained his feet, brushed off his trousers, dried his hands, and got set for the next pitch.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Grove delivered the pitch so fast that not a single fan could see it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Babe swung.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It took the crowd a minute to realize what had happened. The ball was never coming back. Ruth had just knocked the longest home run of his career and one, which of course, won the game for the Yankees.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Following the game, a reporter asked Ruth, "How did you feel after you had missed the ball twice?" Babe replied, "I began to feel sorry for the pitcher, because the law of averages was against him." The reporter persisted, "Didn't you think you were going to&nbsp;<em>fail</em>&nbsp;after those first and second strikes?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Babe stopped, looked the reporter squarely in the eye--and said: "Those strikes were not a&nbsp;<em>failure</em>--they were effort toward&nbsp;<em>success</em>!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your own life, though the way may seem difficult, the job complicated or the task unattainable, you can overcome. Success is possible, even probable, as you remain steadfast in your beliefs, true to your covenants, and worthy of a temple recommend.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the Church of Jesus Christ. He is our King and we are his servants. To give of our time, talent and effort for this great cause is precious little in return for what He did for us. We are never the same after we understand what our Savior, Jesus Christ, did for us in Gethsemane.&nbsp;<br /><br />I leave with you my witness of his divinity and my certainty that our Savior is a resurrected, glorified, living being.

<p>Joseph Smith, in his&nbsp;<em>Lectures on Faith</em>&nbsp;noted that "Three things are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation. First, the idea that he actually exists. Secondly, a&nbsp;<em>correct</em>&nbsp;idea of his character, perfections, and attributes. Thirdly, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; In other words, in order to have faith we must first believe there is something to have faith in, know what He is like, know how to please Him and then actually do those things that are pleasing to Him. If any of these elements are imperfect and lacking, so also will our faith be imperfect and lacking.<br /><br /><strong>The Doctrine of Omniscience</strong><br />For our purposes today, let's focus on just one element of His character, perfections and attributes. It is an attribute that we often give verbal assent to, but that, when examined closely, has some startling implications. The attribute about which I wish to speak is God's omniscience--the fact that He knows all things. On this subject, Elder Neal A. Maxwell once questioned why we are sometimes hesitant to explore this doctrine as well as its implications. He asked:</p>
<p>Why, therefore, is the resistance to them so often present? Is it a lack of humility? Or, once accepted, is it that these truths carry unwanted implications and heavy responsibilities with them? Is it because we are not yet ready? Is it that these truths seem almost too much to comprehend? Probably it is all of these. Therefore it is not because we refuse even to think about these doctrines; rather, it is that when we have explored them somewhat, we return from such a brief reconnaissance less than anxious to make further sorties in that direction. This is a pity, however, because our adoration for and appreciation of God will be measurably increased as we increase our understanding of Him and His plan of happiness.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a></sup></p>
<p>For the next few minutes we have together, let us faithfully and fearlessly explore the doctrine of God's omniscience and some if its implications.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of all the attributes that God possesses, perhaps one of the most important is His omniscience. Joseph Smith noted that "without the knowledge of all things God would not be able to save any portion of his creatures."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;Please remember that; we'll come right back to it. Without His omniscience, He wouldn't be able to save us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, because of the startling implications of this doctrine, we try to "democratize deity" to borrow a phrase from Elder Maxwell.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;Because we can't explain how He knows all things, we sometimes say that, "Well, we lived with him for so long in premortality that He knows us so well that He knows what we'll do in any given situation." While it is true that we were with Him in premortality for a long time, that is not the source of His knowledge.&nbsp; 2 Nephi 2:24 reads, "But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things." 2 Nephi 9:20 asserts that, "...he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it." Further, when Moses visited with the Lord on the mountain, he learned perhaps one way that God knows all things: "...there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that all things are present with God. Thus, in the words of Elder Maxwell again, "God's omniscience is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;solely a function of prolonged and discerning familiarity with us--but of the stunning reality that the past and present and future are part of an 'eternal now' with God!"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp; In these and other scriptural passages about God's omniscience, there are no qualifiers. There is no parenthetical expression that says that He struggles a bit with factorial analysis of variance or may not understand astrophysics very well. There are only simple, clear assertions that He knows all things. And by all things, it means, well, all things!<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Omniscience and agency</strong><br />Perhaps one of the struggles we have with His omniscience is that we wonder if we truly have agency if God knows beforehand all the things we are going to do. We feel like our agency bumps up against His omniscience. If you will permit a short personal experience, it may illustrate this point.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was younger, like you, I was taught that God knows all things, and I did worry about how that impacted my agency. So, being somewhat spiritually immature, I would work our little experiments in my mind. For example, I would think, "Okay, I'm going to put my hand in my pocket, but He knows I'm going to put my hand in my pocket," so at the last second I'd pull my hand away and then think "but He knew I was going to try to fake Him out, so did I really have a choice?" It is true, I was pretty spiritually immature. Since then, I've come to be grateful that He knows everything.&nbsp;<br /><br />A familiar example from Joseph Smith's life can illustrate why each of us should be eternally grateful for God's omniscience. By June 14, 1828, the prophet had translated 116 pages of manuscript from the plates.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;Joseph Smith had been helped by a wealthy man roughly twice his age--Martin Harris. Martin's wife, Lucy, was not supportive of the work, and even after having a dream that told her she was fighting against the work of the Lord, still criticized the work. To allay her fears, Martin asked for permission to show her the 116 pages, and though permission was granted after multiple requests, this action did not gain the Lord's approval (you see, permission and approval are not the same thing). As a result, and as is commonly known, the 116 pages of manuscript were lost.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can imagine what Joseph might have felt as he lamented, "All is lost! All is lost! What shall I do? I have sinned--it is I who tempted the wrath of God. I should have been satisfied with the first answer which I received from the Lord."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;What is it that might have been lost? Perhaps in Joseph's mind, in addition to the 116 pages that were lost, the work of the Restoration had been destroyed because he feared man more than God.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />This event, though traumatic for the young prophet, did not take the Lord by surprise. While Joseph wouldn't be able to retranslate the 116 pages because of the changes that had already been made (see D&amp;C 10), the Lord had provided a way for him about 2400 years in advance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nephi was merrily keeping a record of what happened to his family when, in 1 Nephi 9, he received a prompting to make a duplicate set of plates. Please notice what he says about this prompting in relation to God's omniscience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not. But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn10" target="_self">10</a></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn10" target="_self"></a></sup>About 1,000 years later, as Mormon was compiling the record, he found the duplicate record that Nephi had made and received a similar prompting to include it in the record. Again, please notice his words regarding God's omniscience:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And this I do for a wise purpose for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither Nephi nor Mormon knew why they included the duplicate record, but the Lord knew and so do we. Think of it, brothers and sisters, the Lord prepared a way for Joseph Smith to overcome his big mistake 2,400 years ahead of time! He could not have done that were he less than omniscient.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my testimony to you that God has prepared a way for you too. He knew you were coming. He knows where you will be. He knows what problems you will face, and I promise that He has already prepared a way for you just like He did for Joseph Smith. In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we learn that the Lord is no respecter of persons<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;; if He prepared the way for Joseph Smith, He'll do the same for us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, please remember that earlier we discussed that Joseph Smith taught that God could not save any portion of His creations if He were not omniscient. &nbsp;Here is one reason why His knowledge is that important and why we should be eternally grateful for His omniscience. Brothers and sisters, the year now is 2013. The Savior atoned for our sins nearly 2,000 years ago. How could He have atoned for our sins (and I testify that He did in reality atone for us) if He didn't know exactly what those sins were going to be? Imagine that He overlooked or forgot a single sin, and that single sin happened to be yours. Your debt to justice would therefore not be completely paid. Imagine what would happen then. Not a pleasant thought, is it? And please keep in mind that it wasn't just the sins of the world He atoned for, it was&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;sins and it was&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;sins that were&nbsp;<em>individually</em>&nbsp;atoned for. Please listen to the Holy Ghost as you hear former Presiding Bishop, Bishop Merrill J. Bateman's words about this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Savior, as a member of the Godhead, knows each of us personally. Isaiah and the prophet Abinadi said that when Christ would "make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed" (<a href="file://localhost/javascript/void(0)%3B" target="_self">Isa. 53:10</a>; compare&nbsp;<a href="file://localhost/javascript/void(0)%3B" target="_self">Mosiah 15:10</a>). Abinadi explains that "his seed" are the righteous, those who follow the prophets (see&nbsp;<a href="file://localhost/javascript/void(0)%3B" target="_self">Mosiah 15:11</a>). In the garden and on the cross, Jesus saw each of us and not only bore our sins, but also experienced our deepest feelings so that he would know how to comfort and strengthen us...The Savior's atonement in the garden and on the cross is intimate as well as infinite. Infinite in that it spans the eternities. Intimate in that the Savior felt each person's pains, sufferings, and sicknesses. Consequently, he knows how to carry our sorrows and relieve our burdens that we might be healed from within, made whole persons, and receive everlasting joy in his kingdom.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>The Savior could not have atoned for us individually had he not known what our individual sins, infirmities, pains, and sorrows were going to be. Not only does the atonement grow out of God's mercy, it also grows out of His omniscience. Our worry about our agency being threatened by God's omniscience should be swallowed up in our gratitude that He knows all the dumb stuff we are going to do and has prepared a way for us to overcome those things. And frankly, we should be much more concerned about becoming entangled in sin and having sin impinge on our agency than we are about God taking our agency. He will not do that.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Implications of God's omniscience</strong><br />Having discussed the doctrine of God's omniscience, we can press forward to the implications that His omniscience has for us. Sometimes this impact can be felt on a daily basis.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Implication #1: Prophecy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>On occasion, we hear people, sometimes even members of the church, share their opinion that the Brethren are old, out-of-date, and antiquated. Some even dismiss prophetic teaching as mere opinion. Brothers and sisters, if we do this we do it at very grave spiritual peril. If we have true prophets (and I testify that we do), and an omniscient God (and I testify that we have that too), prophecy is much more than mere prediction and prophetic counsel is much more than opinion. It is revelation direct from an omniscient God. To reject prophetic counsel, therefore, is to reject Him who reveals that counsel. It is no wonder that in the scriptures, rejection of the prophets inevitably led to destruction.One of the sad common threads of each destroyed society, from the flood, to Sodom and Gomorrah, to the Jaredites and Nephites and at all points in between, is that each society rejected the prophets. Some societies killed the prophets while others cast them out.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants revealed to Joseph Smith, the Lord issued a stern warning: "The day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp; While the destruction may not be a physical destruction right now, there is a spiritual destruction that comes. Perhaps that is why, in Doctrine and Covenants 21, we are commanded to "give heed unto all his words and commandments...for his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn15" target="_self">15</a></sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles observed, "Any Church member not obedient to the leaders of this Church will not have the opportunity to be obedient to the promptings of the Lord."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;Setting at naught the counsel of leaders, therefore, takes the influence of the Holy Spirit from our lives, leaving us to ourselves, and trusting in the arm of flesh has never ended well for those who have tried it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes prophetic counsel may contradict our own opinions or views. Sometimes we may need to humble ourselves and come before the Lord in the spirit of "not my will but thine, be done."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a>&nbsp; Sometimes we may even need sincere repentance. When dealing with prophets sent by an omniscient God though, that is what is required. If we are willing to try on such humility for size, we just might find it to be more comfortable than our worldly pride.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition, following the prophets always leads us closer to God, and the time is already upon us that we and our families need the safety that comes from following the prophet. Elder Neal A. Maxwell noted:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is exceedingly important for members of the Church to get experience following the prophets in little things, so that they can follow in large matters. By following the prophets in fair weather we become familiar with their cadence, so that we can follow them in stormy times too, for then both our reflexes and our experience will need to combine to help us; the stresses will be so very real.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn18" target="_self">18</a></p>
<p>Here, I make a sincere plea: please follow the prophet both in the big and little things. I promise that doing so will bring blessings and safety.&nbsp;<br /><br />Related to setting aside prophetic counsel is not even seeking that counsel and further, sometimes not even seeking the Lord's guidance through prayer. Sometimes, we decide what will be convenient for us. We decide, "I don't want to go on a mission until..." or, "I don't want to get married until..." or, "We can't start having children until..." and then follow with a phrase related to our own plans and convenience. May I suggest we take into account prophetic counsel and submit such decisions to the Lord to ask what He wants us to do? Isaiah's words related to this are sobering: "Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand--ye shall lie down in sorrow."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;It takes humility and courage to follow prophets and promptings, but the rewards are certainly worth it. When we choose to follow an omniscient God when He speaks, whether through promptings or prophets, things turn out better.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Implication #2: you'll be asked to do hard things, and that is okay.</strong>&nbsp;Each of us has probably heard the sentiment that this world is just so wicked now that for someone to get married and start a family during this time may not be wise. Can't we just wait for the millennium to start so that all the wickedness will be taken away and our children can "grow up without sin unto salvation."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn20" target="_self">[20]</a>&nbsp;Other difficulties in the latter-days can cause us to shrink and wonder if we are equal to the task. Brothers and sisters, it isn't a mistake that you were born when you were. God, who knows all, knows you and the state of the world you are living in. The timing and place of your birth was not a mistake. Those determinations were made by one who "doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;You can press forward with faith and courage that He knows that you are equal to the task. He knows you. He knows the children He is going to send to your family. He has measured you and measured them and matched you up perfectly.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Old Testament king, Hezekiah, was asked to do something difficult too. The Assyrian army had marched toward Jerusalem, leaving destruction in its wake. None of the cities were able to withstand the siege of the Assyrians, and smoke from their destruction would have been visible from Jerusalem at that time.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;Hezekiah knew from a prophet, Isaiah, that they would be put under siege and had already had workers tunnel over 1700 feet through stone to bring water within the walls of Jerusalem, but this wasn't enough to deliver the people. In those dire circumstances, Hezekiah received a letter from the Assyrian king that said, "Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?"<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn23" target="_self">23</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Hezekiah turned to the Lord, took that letter into the temple, and spread it out before the Lord. Please listen to the Holy Ghost as you hear the words of Hezekiah's prayer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou are the God even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the Living God. Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries, And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord even thou only.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn24" target="_self">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The same omniscient God who hears and answers our prayers answered this humble plea. Isaiah prophesied that they wouldn't even shoot an arrow into Jerusalem<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn25" target="_self">25</a>&nbsp; and indeed, an angel smote the Assyrian army before they could destroy Jerusalem.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn26" target="_self">26</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, not only does God know what situations we will find ourselves in, He can do something about it. Though there will be bumps in the road, you are equal to those bumps and can overcome them, which leads us to our final implication: difficulties will come, but the Savior knows perfectly how to see us through them.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Implication #3: Difficulties will come, but the Savior knows perfectly how to see us through them.&nbsp;</strong>It is interesting that of all the attributes of the Savior that Isaiah could have emphasized, of everything the prophet could have taught, he seems to be intrigued by the fact that the Savior would be "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn27" target="_self"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;In a time of his own severe trial, Joseph Smith learned that "the Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn28" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp;There is no depth of sorrow and anguish that the Savior does not understand. And the price He paid to know and understand us was a heavy price indeed.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Henry B. Eyring taught something that I'd like to use as a preface for this discussion. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It will comfort us when we must wait in distress for the Savior's promised relief that He knows, from experience, how to heal and help us. The&nbsp;<em>Book of Mormon</em>&nbsp;gives us the certain assurance of His power to comfort. And faith in that power will give us patience as we pray and work and wait for help. He could have known how to succor us simply by revelation, but He chose to learn by His own personal experience.<sup>29</sup></p>
<p>This is what Alma meant when he said, in Alma 7:13, "Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh." To gain a view, and I hope a greater appreciation, for what the Savior did let's start with Him and His disciples in the upper room.&nbsp;<br /><br />After the last supper, after Judas was dismissed and after they had sung a hymn, the Savior and His disciples left the upper room to proceed toward the Garden of Gethsemane.&nbsp; As the map from the LDS edition of the scriptures shows, the traditional spot of the upper room was on the Southwest corner of Jerusalem, near the Hinnom valley. Now, I must confess that I don't know which direction the Savior went to travel toward Gethsemane, but I have a hunch that he avoided passing through the midst of Jerusalem, seeking privacy and solitude for Himself and His disciples. Now, please keep in mind that the last supper was a Passover meal, and each Passover coincides with a full moon. While we don't know what the weather was like, it is possible that the full moon illuminated their path as they proceeded toward Gethsemane.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as an aside, the valley that they would have walked along, the Hinnom valley, was formerly a place where gruesome sacrifices to false gods were made. &nbsp;Because of that, at the time of Jesus, the garbage from the city was burned there. The valley, with its continual burning, became known as&nbsp;<em>Gehenna</em>, or as we say it in English, hell. It is interesting to think that the Savior possibly passed symbolically through hell on His way to confront all the fury of hell.&nbsp;<br /><br />The path that the Savior may have walked is on the left side of the photograph, while Gethsemane is just off the screen in the right side. As the Savior would have proceeded along this path, the graveyard that is in the foreground would have soon come into view. We can only imagine what His thoughts might have been as he saw those whited sepulchers for perhaps the first time that night, gleaming in the light of a full moon. He knew what He was about to do, and &nbsp;he certainly knew that He would soon be joining the hosts of the dead. I wonder what feelings He had as He viewed those tombs.&nbsp;<br /><br />When He arrived in Gethsemane, and as the atoning process had begun, he cried out "Abba, Father, All things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."&nbsp; Finite, mortal minds cannot really comprehend what was happening to the Savior at that moment, but what we can understand is that in some way, the Savior was taking upon himself not only our sins, but also, according to Alma, our pains, sicknesses, and infirmities.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn29" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;To quote Elder Holland:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To the thoughtful follower of Christ, it is a matter of surpassing wonder that the voluntary and merciful sacrifice of a single being could satisfy the infinite and eternal demands of justice; atone for every human misdeed; bear every mortal infirmity; feel every personal heartache, sorrow, and loss. But I testify that is exactly what Christ did for every one of us. I bear solemn witness that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is the compassionate foundation and central fact in God's eternal plan for our salvation and our happiness.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn30" target="_self"><em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong></em></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I add my witness that the Savior did just that? He knows us perfectly because He suffered perfectly for each one of our personal heartaches, sorrows, and losses. Truly, He is acquainted with grief. &nbsp;Because of His perfect understanding, He also knows perfectly how to succor&nbsp;<em>us</em>--how to run to&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;aid. Because of His omniscience, we can be sure that, to paraphrase Elder Maxwell again, the temperature on the furnace of affliction will not be too high.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn31" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp; He knows just what we need to refine, purify, and teach us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where can I turn for peace?<br />Where is my solace when other sources cease to make me whole?<br />...Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish?<br />Who, who can understand?<br />He, only one.&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_16_Butterfield.htm#_edn32" target="_self">33</a></sup>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong><br /></strong>So far, I've tried to be fairly impersonal and let the doctrine stand for itself without much commentary nor personal experience. Now, in conclusion, I'd like to be very personal. I'd like to bear my witness, given to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, that there is a God in Heaven. He is our Father. He loves us. He knows us personally, even better than we know ourselves.&nbsp; He sees all things as if they were one eternal now. There was a time early in our marriage that my wife and I were driven to a place from which we had no power to extricate ourselves. I'll spare you the details, but competent medical professionals didn't give us much hope of keeping our firstborn child, a son. Heavenly Father knew we were coming though and prepared a way for us. He raised up a doctor who believes in miracles. He gave my good wife the courage and faith of Job. He taught us that because He was willing to give up His son, we would have the opportunity to keep our son. In each step along the way, we knew that He knew. &nbsp;I am grateful for His omniscience, and I have felt His guiding hand in putting me in the right place at the right time to learn what I needed to for employment, to meet my wife whom I love, to guide me to where He wanted me to be employed, and to help us raise four wonderful children. I am grateful for His son, and I know that His Son atoned for us. I also know that none of these things would be possible without His omniscience. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us have heard some version of the adage, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stand for something, you will fall for anything.&rdquo; The statement has been attributed to a number of different sources; however, the Congressional Research Service cites Peter Marshall, who served as chaplain to the U.S. Senate following World War II, as the most likely original reference. In a prayer offered before one of the opening sessions of the Eighty-First Congress, he stated, &ldquo;Our Father&hellip;Give us clear vision that we may know where to stand and what to stand for &ndash; because unless we stand for something, we shall fall for anything.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a time when it will become increasingly important that individually and collectively we take a stand for truth and what is right. Charles Dickens articulated eloquently a view of a world not dissimilar to our own. He wrote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints, we have the truth and we know what the ultimate outcome will be of this mortal existence; however, we also know that &ldquo;Satan is abroad in the land, and [that] he goeth forth deceiving the nations.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, we all will need to know where we stand and what we stand for. As you now graduate and leave the wonderful but insulated environment of BYU-Idaho, it will be important to be firmly rooted and be able to take a stand when appropriate. I would like to share three brief examples to help you remember to Stand Up, to Stand Firm, and to Stand Tall. If I knew each of you well enough, I could probably use examples from your lives; I have chosen to cite instances of people familiar to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stand Up </strong></p>
<p>The first is from the life of President Joseph F. Smith (1838-1918). As a young man, he was called to be a missionary to the Sandwich Islands. At age 19, on his way home to Utah, he and a few other missionaries were traveling together. One day, a group of drunken ruffians rode up on horses, firing their guns, yelling wildly, and cursing the Mormons. Most of the missionaries had heard the riders coming into camp so they sought refuge in the brush some distance away to hide and wait for the men to leave. Young Joseph had been gathering wood and walked into camp at an inopportune moment. The leader jumped of his horse and shouted, &ldquo;We will kill anyone who is a Mormon!&rdquo; He shoved his gun into Joseph F.&rsquo;s face and asked, &ldquo;Are you a Mormon?&rdquo; Mustering his courage, he stood tall, looked the man in the eye and said, &ldquo;Yes siree; died in the wool; true blue, through and through!&rdquo; The man was so stunned by the bold and unexpected response that he lowered his gun and looked at the young man incredulously. He then said, &ldquo;You are the ______ ______ pleasantest man I ever met! I&rsquo;m glad to see a fellow that will stand up for his convictions.&rdquo; The man then got on his horse and, with his companions, rode away.<sup><a href="#_edn4" target="_self">4</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us must at times courageously and firmly stand up for what we are and what we believe. It may not be easy, convenient, or politically correct to stand up in the face of opposition, but it will always be right. Do what is right, let the consequence follow.<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stand Firm</strong></p>
<p>The next example is taken from the life of President James E. Faust (1920-2007). &nbsp;In 1942, he was conscripted into military service. As a new private, he was given guard duty at the military base where he was stationed. He said he spent a long, cold night marching, shivering, and trying to stay awake. He also spent a lot of time thinking and concluded that if he wanted to avoid guard duty in the future he would need to become an officer, so he applied for officer candidate school. At age 22, he said his resume was not very extensive or impressive, but he proudly noted that he had served faithfully as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He and a few others were summoned to a board of inquiry to consider their applications. He related that the board, a group of seasoned and somewhat hardened military officers, began peppering him with questions primarily about his religious beliefs and missionary service. During the questioning, they asked him whether he smoke or drank; they asked how he felt about others who do. They asked if he prayed and whether he felt it was appropriate for a military officer to pray. They also asked whether the circumstances of war justified loosening the moral code because the rigors and stresses of battle might justify allowing men to do things they would normally not do at home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Faust related that this experience was a pivotal point for him in his life &ndash; he could try to appear tolerant and broad minded or he could respond how he believed and had been taught. After agonizing over how to respond, he did not equivocate. (The text from Isaiah in the New International Version of the Bible underscores this principle: &ldquo;If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>) He answered honestly and directly. He said that as he left the room, he was sure these officers did not share his beliefs and would not like the answers he had given. He was quite sure his opportunity to become an officer had evaporated. However, when the results were posted, he received one of the highest scores. He was in the first group taken for officers&rsquo; school, and after graduation, became a second lieutenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Faust acknowledged that standing firm for our beliefs will not always have favorable results with those of this world, but it will always strengthen our faith and our relationship with God.<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;As another hymn so poignantly points out, for those who stand on a firm foundation, He will &ldquo;never, no never forsake.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stand Tall</strong></p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008) was one of the greatest orators of this dispensation. He spoke plainly about taking a stand. He stated, &ldquo;We are involved in an intense battle. It is a battle between right and wrong, between truth and error, between the design of the Almighty on the one hand and that of Lucifer on the other. For that reason, we desperately need moral men and women who stand on principle&hellip;The time has come for us to stand a little taller&hellip;This is a season to be strong. It is a time to move forward without hesitation, knowing well the meaning, the breadth, and the importance of our mission. It is a time to do what is right, regardless of the consequences that might follow. We have nothing to fear. God is at the helm.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our current prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, has also encouraged us to have the &ldquo;courage to stand firm for truth and righteousness,&rdquo;<a href="#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;to &ldquo;stand in holy places,&rdquo;<a href="#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;and to &ldquo;ever be courageous and prepared to stand for what we believe, and if we must stand alone&hellip;[know] that in reality we are never alone when we stand with our Father in Heaven.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#_edn12" target="_self">12</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May each of us go forward having a determination to serve God faithfully to the end,<a href="#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;knowing where we stand and what we stand for: stand up, stand firm, and stand tall. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>Before I offer a few remarks to the graduates, I would like to say a word to the parents.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for entrusting your children to us.&nbsp; We love them very much.&nbsp; As I look at you today, I think of all the prayers you have said on behalf of your children.&nbsp; I think of all the home evenings and family dinners.&nbsp; I think of all the times you sat up waiting for them to come home.&nbsp; I think of your devotion to them and your love for them.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>I would like to tell you something about your children.&nbsp; The light of the Spirit is in their eyes, and the love of the Savior is in their hearts.&nbsp; These are priceless spiritual gifts.&nbsp; Your children have worked hard at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; They have qualified for the blessings of increased faith, testimony, knowledge, and skills that will be of great value to them and their families and to the kingdom of God.&nbsp; They have become disciples of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The Lord will send your children on His errands in a world in turmoil, and He and His spirit and the holy angels will go with them.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, I speak to the graduates.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>My dear brothers and sisters, I love you very much.&nbsp; I want to share with you today a thought from a scripture that I love.&nbsp; It is found in Isaiah chapter 40, verses 28 to 31:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hast thou not known?&nbsp; hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?&nbsp; there is no searching of his understanding.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>But they that wait upon the Lord shall </strong><strong>renew</strong><strong> their </strong><strong>strength</strong><strong>; they shall mount up with wings as </strong><strong>eagles</strong><strong>; they shall </strong><strong>run</strong><strong>, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>When Isaiah wrote these words, he knew, as you and I know, that mortal life is full of challenges and opportunities that stretch us and try us.&nbsp; But we can know, as Isaiah knew, that the Creator, the Holy Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; In the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross at Calvary, He did not shrink.&nbsp; He suffered and died for us, and He rose triumphant over death and sin and everything else that stands in the way of our happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.&nbsp; He does not faint, and He never is weary.&nbsp; He has all power over all things, and His love never fails.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>If you will wait upon the Lord with hope and faith in Him, you will face whatever life brings you with confidence and courage. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To wait upon the Lord is to hope for His coming in power and glory.&nbsp; It is to always remember Him, always pray to the Father in His name, and always have His Spirit to be with you.&nbsp; To wait upon the Lord is to be good, to obey Him, and to serve Him and love Him with all your heart.&nbsp; To wait upon the Lord is to put Him at the center of your life.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>If you wait upon the Lord in this way, your life will be full of His love and His power.&nbsp; He will lift you beyond anything you can imagine.&nbsp; It will be as though you are an eagle fighting through the storms and soaring in the sun to spiritual heights of joy and happiness and peace.&nbsp; He will give you physical, spiritual, and emotional strength so that you will not be weary in mind or body when He calls you to do hard things.&nbsp; When you face the challenges and the opportunities of life, you will not faint or shrink.&nbsp; You will have confidence and courage in Him.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a marvelous promise from the Lord, especially for the Saints of the latter days.&nbsp; There is all around us now, and there will be all around us in the days ahead, diabolical &ldquo;shafts in the whirlwind,&rdquo; &ldquo;cunning devices,&rdquo; &ldquo;lying craftiness,&rdquo; subtle deception, &ldquo;flattery,&rdquo; &ldquo;doctrines of devils, [and] the commandments of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are all designed to tempt you, deceive you, turn you away from Christ, and bring you down to destruction.&nbsp; If you wait upon the Lord and put Him at the center of your life, you will not be deceived; you will not fall.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>And so I say to you tonight, go forward unafraid, with confidence and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I know He lives.&nbsp; I know He loves you and has called you to a great work in His kingdom.&nbsp; His promises are true.&nbsp; I know that if you wait upon the Lord, you will &ldquo;mount up with wings as </strong><strong>eagles</strong><strong>; [you] shall </strong><strong>run</strong><strong>, and not be weary; and [you] shall walk, and not faint.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>My attention was captured awhile back by a tee-shirt quote that said, "It's all about me. Deal with it." I've heard similar words in music and commercials. From day spas to credit cards the commercials want us to believe, "It is all about me." From country music to rap a recurring message is, "It's all about me." My son, Dallin, and I were visiting about this dangerous attitude a couple years ago. He told me about the beginning of one of his high school classes. The teacher had had a huge impact on him when she asked the students to write one note in particular in their notebook: "The world's biggest lie: It's all about me."<br /><br />I can remember being taught this lesson many times in my life. Once, when I was in high school and we lived on a family farm in Buhl, Idaho. Our farm had a dairy, lots of row crops, some fruit trees, and three fish ponds. My father loved the fish ponds and he regularly invited Cub Scout groups or youth groups to come fishing. But the ponds took a lot of work. Before someone would come to fish we had to clean the weeds away from the edges of the ponds, make sure the water was clear and that any muddy irrigation water was diverted so that the area was clean and presentable for his fisherman friends. Anytime someone would come to fish, the whole family would join Dad and our guests. We would help them bait the hooks, teach them to use lures or counterfeit worms, how to hide the hook, how to cast the fishing pole or remove the snags, and we would talk to them while we sat and waited for the fish to bite.&nbsp;<br /><br />On one occasion there were lots of little boys and their parents there fishing, and I was a little impatient. My "It's all about me" attitude showed in how I was treating others, and I started to complain about all the work required for this "foolish fishing" event. Turning to my father, I asked permission to leave because "<em>I</em>&nbsp;wasn't getting anything out of the experience." He looked me straight in the eyes and without even a second's hesitation said, "Maybe it's not about you."&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan had fed me a lie. He had baited his hook with a counterfeit truth and I had believed it. He told me, "It was all about me." But, it's a lie. Ponder Satan's attitude described in Moses 4:1, "and [Satan] came before me saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor." In contrast, consider the Savior's words in the following verse, "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus Christ already understood the truth that he would teach over and over again when he would come to the earth: "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;He understood he wouldn't be fulfilling his mission for his own glory. No, it would be for the glory of His Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord told us the day would come when our generation would really believe the world's lie. In D&amp;C 1:16 we read his description of our day: "They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol"<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;</sup>Idolatry of the individual.We are living in the day of fulfillment for this verse. Think of the "It's all about me" attitudes and problems of today which show that we have cut ourselves off from the prophets and walk in our own ways, after the image of our own gods:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We definitely aren't the first group of people to have these attitudes or problems. As we study Mosiah 11, find the words or phrases which show King Noah's "It's all about me" attitude:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold<em>, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart.</em>&nbsp;And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part of all their grain.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And&nbsp;<em>all this did he take to support himself</em>, and his wives and his concubines; and also his priests, and their wives and their concubines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by his father, and consecrated new ones in their stead,&nbsp;<em>such as were lifted up in the pride of their hearts</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, and thus they were supported&nbsp;<em>in their laziness, and in their idolatry</em>, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, and&nbsp;<em>they also became idolatrous</em>, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And&nbsp;<em>he also built him a spacious palace</em>, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that&nbsp;<em>he placed his heart upon his riches</em>, and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in the land; and he built winepresses, and made wine in abundance; and therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can see from these verses that King Noah believed the great lie--"It's all about me." His world revolved around himself and he successfully persuaded many to follow him in his self-centered, self-indulging, "It's all about me" lifestyle. It's easy for all of us to get caught up in such a lifestyle where we think everyone and everything should be trying to meet our needs and our wants. Let's think back to the last time you were frustrated; why were you frustrated? Did we have to cancel our own plans because someone else in the family or apartment had a competing event? Did we have to adjust our thoughts or our feelings because of someone else's needs or wants? How willing are we to support our brother's event and miss our own? What about the last time we were told "no" on any subject; how did we respond?</p>
<p>Sometimes we read this story and think King Noah was so wicked because he killed Abinadi, but his wickedness began with an attitude of entitlement. Consider how he got into that position. His father, Zeniff, had been overzealous to inherit the land of their fathers, had rejected the divinely inspired exodus from the land of Nephi, and had covenanted with the king of the Lamanites for the land of their fathers, not realizing that King Laman had entered into such a covenant with the purpose of bringing the people into bondage. Later, King Noah inherited the enslaved kingdom from his father.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have a parallel situation today. We are so blessed with possessing and receiving the worldly stuff that we live in bondage believing that we actually own this world. We begin to think all this stuff is ours. Satan tries to ensnare us by planting thoughts in our hearts and minds that we are owed a certain lifestyle or certain indulgences. And sometimes we reject the prophetic warnings to flee from the things of the world and the attitude of "It's all about me."&nbsp;<br /><br />President Kimball, while speaking to the youth, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To do the special things given to this generation, you will need to guard against selfishness. One of the tendencies most individuals have which simply must be overcome is the tendency to be selfish. All that you can do now while you are young and are more pliant to become less selfish and more selfless will be an important and lasting contribution to the quality of your life in the years, indeed in the eternity, to come. You will be a much better wife or a much better husband, a better mother or a better father, if you can curb the tendency to be selfish.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Joe J. Christensen taught, "Children who always get what they want will want as long as they live. And somewhere along the line it is important for the character development of our children to learn that 'the earth still revolves around the sun' and not around them."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />King Noah's selfishness blurred his vision of what the Lord could do with him. Can you imagine how the story of King Noah may have been different had he learned self-restraint or if he had listened to a prophet's voice instead of advocating the idolatry of the individual?&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Bruce C. Hafen taught about individualism and self-centeredness when he warned about some of the modern wolves attacking family and marriage today. He said, "[Another attacking] wolf is the excessive individualism that has spawned today's contractual attitudes. ...The adversary has long cultivated this overemphasis on personal autonomy, and now he feverishly exploits it. Our deepest God-given instinct is to run to the arms of those who need us and sustain us. But he [Satan] drives us away from each other today with wedges of distrust and suspicion. He exaggerates the need for having space, getting out, [doing it my way] and being left alone. Some people believe him--and then they wonder why they feel left alone."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />On another occasion, Elder Hafen taught: "Nobody really wants to be lonely, but the lifestyles associated with today's frenzied search for 'individual freedom' often lead, unsurprisingly, to loneliness."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We are witnessing a downward spiral in the morals of the world as we watch a replay of King Noah's idolatrous story. For the past forty years, the laws in this country have been modified and torn apart in a search for individual identity and individual rights. Now, as never before, the rights of individuals seem to trump marriage rights, parenting rights, the rights of the unborn, rights of speech and rights of worship. It is deteriorating our relationships in every aspect of our lives. And many of you born during these past forty years are taught to believe the world's biggest lie: It's all about me. Well, it's not. The world is wrong and Satan is intentionally misleading as many as he can. He is lonely, and unhappy and miserable. Because of Satan's selfishness from the beginning, "he [fell] from heaven, and [became] miserable forever, he [seeks] also the misery of all mankind."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />As we allow Satan's taunting and tempting influence in our lives, the relationships around us will suffer. Many of the attitudes and behaviors that weaken relationships in family, business and education can be summed up in one word:&nbsp;<em>selfishness.</em>&nbsp;President Hinckley said: "I find selfishness to be the root cause of most [broken homes]. ... Selfishness is the antithesis of love. It is a cankering expression of greed. It destroys self-discipline. It obliterates loyalty."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior taught us how to overcome this dangerous, relationship-destroying attitude in John 10: 10-13, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." Jesus then explains how his plan works, "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd&nbsp;<em>giveth his life</em>&nbsp;for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />So, the question for our relationships becomes this: Do I care for my friends and family and neighbor as a hireling or as a shepherd? Am I willing to give of myself or of my lifestyle for others? Or am I more worried about my own wants and desires than I am for theirs?Let us return to the story of our great, selfish, "It's all about me" King Noah. He was confronted by one sent from God to correct his ways. The Lord sent Abinadi to try to save a people from the idolatry of the individual "that they might have life more abundantly."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;Instead, they as a people rejected the Lord's prophet and lived their idolatrous lives day by day into a literal slavery.&nbsp;<br /><br />Isn't it interesting that today we can easily identify "others" who, like King Noah, are selfishly caught in the slavery of pornography, abortion, alternative sexual lifestyles, living beyond their means, etc.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, are we just as aware of how the same selfish "It's all about me" attitude also affects our relationships with parents and siblings, roommates, coworkers, employers, and even fellow students and faculty? Do we sense how selfish contention forces the Holy Ghost to leave us? It affects our relationships with neighbors as charity is traded for criticism and judging of others leads to jealousy. It affects our relationships with fellow students and coworkers as etiquette gives way to envy. Yes, selfishness brings us to rationalize our own selfish behavior and feelings while discounting and distrusting the efforts of others. Finally, the selfish "It's all about me" attitude destroys our relationship with the true and living God as our integrity fades to make place for instant gratification. We replace the God of our Fathers with the gods of our own making.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unlike King Noah, Abinadi was selfless (consider Mosiah 11:20, 26). He accepted the difficult mission call to preach repentance to the people, and the people did not receive him well. I have to ask myself, "Why would Abinadi be willing to accept such a mission?" I'm sure he didn't&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;this mission call. He would have had many reasons to say "No." And later in the story, "Why didn't Abinadi recall his prophetic words when Noah offered him a chance to live?" Because Abinadi understood that&nbsp;<em>this story was not about him.</em>&nbsp;He understood that the story was&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;about the Savior and his loving invitation for his children to return to Him so they could have the blessings and benefits of God's plan of happiness. He knew this story was about the one--the one who may listen and become converted. And, there was one who did listen. Was Abinadi's mission worth the life it cost? It was for Alma. And it was for all those who later followed Alma. Including those of us in this room who have been led to Christ by Alma's teachings. I am so thankful Abinadi was not worrying about his own individual rights and freedom from having to serve the Lord as a missionary.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although Abinadi was willing to lay down his life for the Savior's message to go forward, most of us will not face such a trial. But, everyone of us has been asked to take the prerequisite course, Discipleship 101. We are all asked to live as Christians and die as disciples and thereby submit our lives to our Heavenly Father's will.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was reminded of this lesson again a few years ago when Debi and I were at the University of Utah hospital. She had just embarked on her first of seven surgeries for those next fifteen months and I was in the waiting room, pacing the floor and wondering, "Why is this happening?" I questioned, "Why me? Or Why us?" as I stood there looking out the window gazing across parking lots and Salt Lake City traffic, where everyone was hurrying on their way someplace. I thought, "Nobody even cares that we are here or that life for us is changing." I was scared and I was angry and really I was having my own little pity party. I was all-alone and I had forgotten that this story was not all about me [or us].&nbsp;<br /><br />I sat in an uncomfortable chair alone and away from everyone else, silently praying and then writing some of my thoughts in my journal. But, I felt so alone. I felt terrible as I pondered Debi's pain and our frustration--this didn't fit with our plans. After a long hour of self-pity, I walked to the window again avoiding contact with anyone that might interrupt my self-centered thoughts.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was only there at the window for a few minutes before I noticed an ambulance coming into the parking lot with lights and sirens on; simultaneously a helicopter was landing on the emergency helipad. I could tell something traumatic had happened and doctors and nurses were hurrying into and out of the emergency room area on the other side of the hospital. Suddenly my attention turned to the several cars following the ambulance into the parking lot and people hurrying to get inside the hospital with their loved ones. My thoughts went heavenward as I offered a simple, silent prayer for these people who I didn't even know who were facing some unknown emergency. While praying I also thanked Heavenly Father for our wonderful family and for our temple marriage. I thanked him for our wonderful children that He had entrusted to Debi and me.&nbsp;<br /><br />As my mind shifted back to the waiting room where I was actually standing, and away from my own worries about Debi and myself and our situation, I became aware that there were several families there in the waiting room, and all of them had looks of worry and loneliness and fear. Everyone there seemed to be worried and they were either praying to God or talking amongst themselves trying to reassure each other in one way or another that their family members would be okay.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, it happened, I realized how self-absorbed I had been. I remembered the truth: it's not all about me. "Awake, my soul."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a>&nbsp;</sup>Nephi's words rang in my mind. Wow,it was an&nbsp;<em>ah ha</em>&nbsp;moment and I was being taught by the spirit. I had been so focused on my own feelings I had completely ignored or been unaware of those immediately around me who were in need.&nbsp;<br /><br />I turned to the lady closest to me and asked who she was waiting for and why they were in surgery. Her story unfolded over the next forty-five minutes, and I had the wonderful opportunity to share my belief in God, priesthood power, the plan of happiness and the importance of families. That day turned out to be a wonderful experience getting to know all but one group there in the waiting room.&nbsp;<br /><br />I learned that day that we all have the opportunity to struggle, and the more we learn about other people's lives the more we appreciate the personal trials that we have to face. That day I realized how much the Lord loves all of His children. I even had the privilege of using the priesthood for blessing one of the men in the waiting room. It was a choice experience to feel our Heavenly Father's love for His children as testimonies were shared and love was expressed.&nbsp;<br /><br />That day proved to be the beginning of many trips to the hospital where I loved meeting people and sharing my love for my Heavenly Father. I had learned there in the waiting room for sure we can find many who need a lift. They are all there worried about their own families and friends. But if we can remember that truly the story is not about us but about how we lift others, wow, the world opens up for all of us just like it did that day for me. And we don't have to go to the waiting room to find them--we can find them in our own apartments, wards, and neighborhoods every single day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider the many scriptural examples of those who understood it wasn't about them even in their time of extremity: Sarah gave her handmaid to Abraham; Jonathan supported David in taking over his own father's throne; Joseph of Egypt accepted the Lord's will in his life and became a savior to his own family despite having been sold as a slave by them; Joseph and Emma accepted their divine roles in the restoration of the gospel even though it required of them seemingly endless persecution and ultimately Joseph's life. Can you imagine how life would have been different if any one of them had listened to Satan's lie and believed, "It is all about me. This isn't fair. I'm doing something for me now. I've paid enough of a price for this eternal stuff." What a blessing that each of them hearkened to the voice and will of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, let's look at the story of the Savior. First, facing the extreme pain and difficulty of Gethsemane, he prayed, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;No, he did not look forward to this part of his mission but he loved the Father and he loved us. Now, ponder these statements he made while on the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;"Woman, behold thy son. ... Behold thy mother."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;"To day shalt thou be with me in paradise"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus was not concerned about himself in this hour of horror. Instead, he showed his concern for his executioners, his fellow prisoners, his mother, Mary, and his disciples. Jesus did not fall for Satan's lure "It's all about me." He knew instead it was all about His Father and His Father's children. He understood, brothers and sisters, that it is all about His giving of His life for us. By so doing He gives us all the opportunity to experience the ultimate freedom and taste of a more abundant life, "eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_07_30_Baggett.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Isn't that ironic? Satan's lie is actually a truth misapplied, a counterfeit. In reality, it is all about us. That's why Jesus did what He did. He did it for me and you and every other person who will accept Him as their personal Savior. But we can't have what He offers if we act as though the world revolves around us; instead we must&nbsp;<em>become</em>&nbsp;like He is and lose our life in order to find it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I pray we will not bite at Satan's counterfeit lure of "It's all about me." Instead, I hope we will express our deepest gratitude to our Heavenly Father for the marvelous blessings we enjoy, look to lift and love those around us, serve others with Christlike love, and bring them to the Savior as He brings us--each one of us who is willing--home to our Heavenly Father to dwell with him and with our loved ones eternally. I testify that Jesus Christ lived and that He lives for that very purpose. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, I'm so excited to have the opportunity to address you this afternoon.&nbsp; How blessed we are to be here at BYUI!&nbsp; Do realize what a blessing it is to receive a higher education?&nbsp; As you've heard many times already, there are so many young people all over the world with little chance of more than the most rudimentary education and no chance at all of a higher education.&nbsp; Did you know that only about 7% of the world's population has a college education?<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_06_Harmon.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; But even more important than a higher education - you can get that in many places - you are here to learn in what has been called a disciple preparation center: to learn of temporal things through the lens of eternity, to strengthen your desire and willingness to serve the Lord by listening for and choosing to be obedient to the promptings of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; You have the opportunity to begin each class and every activity with prayer and to request the presence of the Holy Ghost to guide your learning.&nbsp; You are on a sacred, dedicated campus where you can blossom and flourish as a disciple of Christ and where you can gain great strength to face and conquer the challenges that lie before you.</p>
<p><br />Indeed, it is a blessing to be here and how much is hoped for and expected of you!&nbsp; We hope that you will realize that your life is a gift and an opportunity to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord to do much good.&nbsp; Have you ever considered that you will have an increased capacity for the Lord's work because of your experiences here?&nbsp; Will you be ready?&nbsp; Will you have learned what you needed to learn or will you have squandered the time and opportunity?&nbsp; These are sobering questions.&nbsp; What exactly is expected of you?&nbsp; Of course, that varies from person to person, but certainly&nbsp; we all are expected to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp; be humble and serious in your studies so that you can use your education to provide for a family or use your education to nurture your children,<br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp; be a light to those around you, wherever you go, that you would &nbsp;be happy, faithful, trustworthy, and humble,<br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp; serve others, lift the hands that hang down, and demonstrate to those around you that your faith in Christ and His Atonement gives you the strength to serve,&nbsp;<br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp; and you are expected to help build the Kingdom of God here on the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Your education here is not about how much money you'll make in your chosen career.&nbsp; Instead, it is about how you will develop to take advantage of all that is offered you--not only temporally, but also spiritually.&nbsp; Here is fertile ground to grow your soul. Here is a campus surrounded by strong stakes of Zion and a temple of the Lord, a place where you can test your faithfulness and your willingness to serve and learn of your Heavenly Father's great love for you.&nbsp; Your life will become an expression of your love for the Savior.&nbsp; Where much is given, much is required.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to examine four temporal opportunities with eternal consequences that you will find here at BYUI: the honor code, non-proctored exams, learning by the Spirit, and working beyond your capacity.&nbsp;<br /><br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the honor code is always a subject of much debate among students.&nbsp; For some, it is just a necessary nuisance to be able to attend a church school.&nbsp; For some, it is an annoyance beyond compare.&nbsp; For some, it is an opportunity to sacrifice some small pleasures to be obedient.&nbsp; It is not a sin to wear capris or to wear a two-day stubble.&nbsp; These are simply requirements here at BYUI.&nbsp; The honor code is a test, a self-test which you can pass or fail and you will know your score.&nbsp; You were obedient to the honor code or you were not.&nbsp; When asked about the lack of adherence and/or enforcement to the dress and grooming standards by some students, President Clark has repeatedly stated, "We don't need more enforcement of the honor code.&nbsp; We need more obedience."&nbsp; There are many reasons that students break the honor code, and most are not acts of defiance.&nbsp; But whether it is broken by defiance, ignorance, or for other reasons, the rule is still broken and obedience is not given.&nbsp; You will not endanger your eternal salvation by breaking the honor code, but you will have lost an opportunity to show your appreciation for your opportunity to be here.&nbsp;<br /><br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-proctored exams is another subject of debate among many on campus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students appreciate the convenience of unproctored tests.&nbsp; Some think there is not enough oversight to ensure fairness.&nbsp; Though cheating on exams, homework, and projects should never happen among students here at BYUI, sometimes it does.&nbsp; Students sometimes forget who they are or choose to ignore that and in the heat of the moment make mistakes.&nbsp; No test or grade is so important that you should sacrifice your integrity for it.&nbsp; Every unproctored test you take is an opportunity to strengthen your honesty and integrity.&nbsp; Every homework assignment, group project, online course you take, or paper you write is an opportunity to be honest.&nbsp; Any work with your name on it should be your work.&nbsp; It should not be plagiarized or copied from a friend or website.&nbsp; If you use someone else's ideas, you should give them credit by using citations.&nbsp; You should not share homework or electronic files unless your professor explicitly says you can.&nbsp; These are simple things that when repeated over time will give you the strength to face the epidemic of dishonesty that is rampant in the world today.&nbsp;<br /><br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you are here at an institution of higher learning so that you can learn principles of the temporal world that will help you secure a good and meaningful job when you graduate.&nbsp; Even more than that, you are here to learn to think.&nbsp; You are here to learn to think critically and develop your God-given intelligence.&nbsp; How do you learn?&nbsp; Who is the source of all learning?&nbsp; Of course, the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Did you know that you can learn to learn by the Holy Spirit?&nbsp; Elder David A. Bednar gave a wonderful talk<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_06_Harmon.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;in February of 2006 about learning by the Spirit.&nbsp; If you haven't already read it, I hope you will.&nbsp; He talks about the responsibility of the learner to act and to allow the Holy Spirit to bring the truth of what is being taught into the heart of the learner.&nbsp; He talks about how faith is a principle actor in the learning experience.&nbsp; Faith leads to action and the results of our action affirmed by the Holy Spirit give us courage to try again in an ever-expanding upward spiral.&nbsp; Using the Spirit to help you discern truth is a skill that you can develop while here at BYUI.&nbsp; We invite the Spirit into every classroom and we seek to connect eternal principles with your learning.&nbsp; There are devotionals every week dedicated to growing your faith and teaching you of God's love.&nbsp; The Spirit is a tremendous blessing from a Father in Heaven who wants you to succeed in your studies.&nbsp; By learning to learn by the Spirit while you are here, you will always have that blessing with you wherever you are and in whatever circumstance you find yourself. Whether it's a new job, a new child, or a new environment, you will know how to call on the Spirit to teach you what you need to know to succeed.&nbsp;<br /><br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp; You have been given a great opportunity to grow closer to the Lord as you study here at BYUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course you'll start each class with prayer and you'll attend inspiring devotionals that will bring you closer to the Lord.&nbsp; But beyond that, you will face enormous challenges that will cause you to seek the Lord's assistance, if you are wise.&nbsp; Not only will you take harder and harder classes, you will hold important church callings, and you may choose to be involved in any of the hundreds of student activities that are available here.&nbsp; In addition to these undertakings, have you considered that the semesters here are only 13 weeks?&nbsp; That means that you will have to learn in 13 weeks here what you would have learned in 16-17 weeks at another university.&nbsp; Your classes will not run as they did in high school.&nbsp; You will cover material at lightning speed and be expected to learn much of it yourself.&nbsp; You may feel overwhelmed and discouraged.&nbsp; Learn to always, always do your best at everything you do--whether it is school, a job, a family or a church calling.&nbsp; Always, always do your best and then rely on the Lord to help you make up the difference.&nbsp; Of course, if you don't really do your best, you can hardly expect the Lord to fill in your gaps. But I can testify that He even does that sometimes.&nbsp; He wants you to succeed.&nbsp; He wants you to be the best person you can be.&nbsp; You have an ally and a friend in the Savior and He will help you if you do your best to help yourself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, all things temporal point to things eternal.&nbsp; The temporal lessons you learn here will all help point you in the direction of the temple.&nbsp; Here is a proving ground where you and the Lord can test your willingness to make and keep eternal covenants with the Lord in his temple.&nbsp; Let's examine the eternal consequences of the four temporal opportunities I have already mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for instance, the honor code we spoke of earlier.&nbsp; The dress and grooming standards are here to give you the opportunity to follow the counsel given and be obedient to the code of behavior you signed when you came here.&nbsp; Your adherence to the dress and grooming standards displays your willingness to follow those chosen by a prophet of the Lord to lead you.&nbsp; They are small things, but they allow you to show yourself and they display to everyone around you your level of commitment.&nbsp; Yes, more is required of you because so much more is provided for you to learn and become true disciples of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Elder Bednar said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My dear young brothers and sisters, the honor and dress codes are not obstacles designed by out-of-touch old people to hassle you during your time on the Ricks College campus. Rather, the honor code is a lesser law preparation to enter the house of the Lord and make sacred covenants, and the dress code is a lesser law preparation for how you will dress and should act after you have entered into those covenants. If you struggle at Ricks College to obey the lesser and preparatory guidelines contained in the honor and dress codes, then may I candidly suggest that you will not be prepared to make those covenants in the temple.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Honesty and integrity are hallmarks of followers of Christ.&nbsp; Henry Eyring, the Advancement Vice-President, said, "Life is an unproctored test. There is no one watching to keep an employee from embezzling funds or a parent from failing to nurture a child; part of the challenge of performing well in the workplace or the home is doing so on one's honor. A university education that doesn't test for this kind of honor is of lower quality than it could be.&nbsp;<br /><br />The world would reply, "Yes, these are all of these good reasons for un-proctored tests; but what about the risk of cheating?" At BYU-Idaho we have an answer. It was given more than one hundred years ago by Karl G. Maeser, one of the founders of BYU. He said this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have been asked what I mean by 'word of honor'. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may escape; but stand me on the floor and draw a line of chalk around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of the circle? No. Never! I'd die first.</p>
<p>Our lives are not just lived for fun.&nbsp; Each of us has a purpose and has come here to accomplish eternal goals.&nbsp; The covenants we make with the Lord in the temple are demanding and serious and not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; Young people sometimes make temple covenants without realizing the seriousness of the commitment required of them.&nbsp; The covenants that you make with the Lord in the temple are binding in time and eternity.&nbsp; If you are deliberately honest in all you do here, you will be developing a strong sense of integrity and your word of honor will provide strength and security as you serve the Lord, both inside the temple and out.&nbsp; While you are here at BYUI, we are trying to provide you opportunities to live a higher standard to prepare you to live a life which is acceptable to the Lord as one who has covenanted with Him in the temple.&nbsp; The Lord expects much from His temple patrons.&nbsp;<br /><br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp; What about learning by the Spirit?&nbsp; Not only is learning to access the guidance of the Holy Spirit a temporal blessing, it has enormous eternal consequences.&nbsp; By recognizing that you are to act to obtain truth, you will know that no one will be responsible for your testimony besides you.&nbsp; Your testimony can be strengthened by others, but if you want to know truth of a spiritual nature just as with temporal things, you will have to act to obtain it.&nbsp; You will have learned that acting with faith empowers the Spirit to enlighten you.&nbsp; Elder Richard G. Scott gave a devotional on February 24, 2004 entitled,&nbsp;<em>To Live Well Amid Worldly Decay</em>, in which he asked students to respond to various statements without knowing beforehand what they would be.&nbsp; He said that the willingness to act and respond would give the Holy Spirit permission to guide their thoughts and inspire them.&nbsp; He also said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p>It is a process that takes time to master, but its rewards are eternal in that you come to know the voice of the Spirit and can heed it forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you feeling overwhelmed?&nbsp; As I mentioned, your classes will become harder, the demands on your time will increase, you may have responsibilities at work or with a family that demand extra time that you might want for study or leisure.&nbsp; How are you supposed to do all that is expected of you?&nbsp; You can do all that is expected of you and much, much more if you choose, through the power and Atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; An interesting thing about the Atonement:&nbsp; though living your life is not all about you, the Atonement is all about each one of us individually.&nbsp; Christ atoned and died for each of us, for me and for you.&nbsp; In this unfathomable act, He delivered me and you from eternal damnation and provides strength for and relief from the trials we face.&nbsp; His act was to save us and to succor us.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; He did it to be obedient to His Father and because He loves us.&nbsp; He loves me and He loves you.&nbsp; Do you know for sure that He loves you, or is it something you have heard many times but you're not really sure?&nbsp; Because of the experiences I have had over a lifetime, I can say without reservation or condition that I know my Savior lived and died for me and that He has strengthened me to carry whatever burden I have had to bear.&nbsp; He has loved me and taken care of me all the days of my life, though I didn't always see it as clearly as I do now.&nbsp; He loves you.&nbsp; It is the most powerful message of all time.&nbsp; When we realize the unbelievable power and mercy that accompanies his great love for us, we can truly begin to pattern our lives after His and become faithful and fruitful servants in His kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Clark, when he first came to BYUI, said to the faculty, "We must work beyond our capacities.&nbsp; We must rely on the Spirit and the power of the Atonement.&nbsp; Working together we will know that it is the Lord who is accomplishing His work here."&nbsp; I testify that if you will call on your Heavenly Father when you are feeling overwhelmed that He will indeed lift you and help you accomplish the things you need to do.&nbsp; And in the end, you will know that it was the power of the Atonement and the direction of the Holy Ghost that brought you through.&nbsp; These kinds of experiences teach humility - not something most young people dwell on very much.&nbsp; I know I never did.&nbsp; But humility is the key to being teachable and our Savior needs teachable hearts to do His work.&nbsp;<br /><br />We just celebrated Pioneer Day a few weeks ago.&nbsp; May I share my own pioneer-like experience with you when I went back to grad school?&nbsp; At the time, I was newly divorced with 3 children and living in North Carolina.&nbsp; Through many sleepless nights, I made the decision to take my kids and go to Utah State to finish a masters and PhD in Mathematics so I could teach at a university.&nbsp; We started across the country in an old Oldsmobile station wagon, which didn't get out of Tennessee before it started having problems.&nbsp; The trip was one adventure after another until we finally reached Logan and marveled at the beauty of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were especially amazed at the number of LDS churches; it seemed like one on every corner.&nbsp; We were all excited to start over and make Logan home for a while.&nbsp; We were alone, I and three kids, and 2000 miles from any family that I had.&nbsp; I had no support group but the members of my ward.&nbsp; A part of me was terrified that I might fail and what would we do then.&nbsp; We certainly had no money to get back to the east coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I studied and studied for my classes, taught classes as a TA, and tried to be both mother and father to my children.&nbsp; It was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.&nbsp; There were many, many nights when I cried myself to sleep, begging the Lord to help me get through.&nbsp; I really did try to do my best, and though my efforts didn't always seem very effective, I did learn some Mathematics and my children survived.&nbsp; I know that there were times when the Lord held me up by my arms and gave me strength when I had none.&nbsp; I know that there were times when I couldn't remember something on a test and then it would come to my mind or I would remember how to figure it out on the spot.&nbsp; I can honestly tell you that I worked well beyond my capacity and that I relied on the Spirit and the power of the Atonement to complete my work there.&nbsp; I know how I got through the program, on my knees and by the blessings of a loving Heavenly Father who wanted me to succeed as much as I did.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I've had time to reflect over the years since then, I can see that the Lord has been beside me in every trial and in every success.&nbsp; I have never seen a burning bush.&nbsp; I've only audibly heard a voice speak to me once in my life and that was a life-threatening situation that called for immediate action.&nbsp; Instead, I have tried to figure out what was the best thing to do and sought confirmation by prayer.&nbsp; Sometimes, foolishly, I haven't waited for an answer.&nbsp; Sometimes, I've felt like I wasn't really sure what was best, but I've learned without a doubt that the Lord would take care of us and that has built my faith to move forward and how the blessings have showered down!&nbsp;<br /><br />You will have many opportunities for amazing spiritual growth here.&nbsp; Will you take them and become a fruitful tree in God's vineyard and produce an hundred fold or sixty fold or thirty fold, or will you turn away sorrowfully like the rich young ruler who chose other things to focus on? &nbsp;It is a thrill to be out from under your parent's watchful eyes and free to manage your own life.&nbsp; In your excitement to live your life, please remember that it is only when you do your utmost best to be a disciple of Jesus Christ that you will really be happy.&nbsp; It is only when you live your life in the service of the Master and your fellow man that you will find real joy.&nbsp; And then, how the Lord will bless you!&nbsp;<br /><br />We are so blessed, both you and I, to be here where we have so many opportunities to learn life's most important lessons and where we can focus on and learn them in a dedicated and prepared setting.&nbsp; We hope you will grow strong here and then go out to stand tall and pierce the darkness around you with the Light of Christ. &nbsp;My message to you today is a message of joy and gratitude and of hope.&nbsp; Just as the Lord has loved me and taken care of my family and so richly blessed my life, He will just as surely bless yours.&nbsp; His promises are real.&nbsp; Practice obedience while you're here; strengthen your integrity while you're here; learn to learn by the Spirit while you are here; and always do your best to do whatever is required of you and trust in the Lord for the rest.&nbsp; Where much is given, much is required... and then so much more is given.&nbsp; This is my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bio not available</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was in grade school, I learned about Christopher Columbus.&nbsp; My teacher had the class memorize "In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue." I imagined how bold and daring he was to sail into the unknown and I wondered how he could have been so brave.<br /><br />Many years later I learned Columbus did not show the most fearlessness when the Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria set sail. His courage had been tested daily during the previous six years. He had spent those years trying to convince the kings of Portugal, Spain and England to provide the needed money and ships. Finally in 1486, he returned to the Spanish court of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella trying to convince their educated advisors that he could succeed. These learned men didn't just tell him he was wrong; they laughed, mocked, scorned, and ridiculed him.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; Finally, he was able to convince the king and queen to provide the money and ships.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why didn't Columbus give up after three, four, or five years? The obvious answer for us might be that God had a foreordained mission for him. We know this from the Book of Mormon. I would like to suggest an additional reason given by Columbus himself: he recognized and responded to the prompting and knowledge given to him by the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; In a letter to the king and queen of Spain, he wrote, "Our Lord unlocked my mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my emprise[enterprise] called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed.&nbsp; But who can doubt the Holy Ghost inspired me?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Then in his diary, Columbus added:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It was the Lord who put it into my mind (I could feel His hand upon me) the fact that it would be possible to sail from here to the Indies. All who heard of my project rejected it with laughter, ridiculing me. There is no question that the inspiration was from the Holy Spirit because He comforted me. . .<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This is a further testimony that even though the veil is drawn, Columbus was inspired to fulfill his foreordained mission and he knew the knowledge that he would succeed came from the Holy Ghost. This awareness gave him the perseverance and determination to keep trying--he called the "fire for the deed".&nbsp;<br /><br />Even though few of us will discover a new world, we each have a mission and purpose to our lives. Have you ever asked what you are being prepared to accomplish? Remember we came to this earth with talents, abilities and gifts, which will be revealed to each of us if we but ask, "What will the Holy Ghost prompt me to do and give me the 'fire for the deed'?" We will be given the courage and perseverance we each need--if we listen to the knowledge given to us by the precious gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br />In his discourses, President Wilford Woodruff stated that while eternal life is the greatest of all the gifts in eternity, the gift of the Holy Ghost is the greatest of all the gifts of God in this life.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;In his book&nbsp;<em>Coming to Know Christ,&nbsp;</em>Brother Robert L. Millet, agrees:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Spirit in our life is God's sweet certification to us that we're on course, in covenant, and in line eventually to receive eternal life. The Holy Spirit is God's down payment to us, his "earnest money" on us, his indication that he seriously intends to save us with an everlasting salvation.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The terms "down payment" and "earnest money" give us an understanding of God's commitment to us and in turn, why our need to commit to Him is so vital.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Joseph Smith appeared in a vision to Brigham Young in February, 1847, he could have given any advice to the struggling saints, but he taught them that their commitment was critical:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the still small voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Tell the brethren if they will follow the spirit of the Lord, they will go right. . .&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>May I share with you what three of our modern church leaders have taught that I pray will add to your understanding of the Holy Ghost? Elder Dallin H. Oaks bears witness, "I testify that these things are true.&nbsp; We have the gift of the Holy Ghost, the right to the constant companionship of the Spirit of the Lord to testify of the Father and of the Son, to lead us into truth, to teach us all things, and to bring all things to our remembrance."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />President James E. Faust affirms:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The comforting Spirit of the Holy Ghost can abide with us twenty-four hours a day when we work, when we play, when we rest. Its strengthening influence can be with us year in and year out. That sustaining influence can be with us in joy and sorrow, when we rejoice as well as when we grieve.</p>
<p>Then, he makes a bold statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I believe the Spirit of the Holy Ghost is the greatest guarantor of inward peace in our unstable world. It can be more mind-expanding and can make us have a better sense of well-being than any other chemical or other earthly substance. It can calm nerves; it will bring peace to our souls.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>We are privileged to receive guidance, peace and calmness in a stressful world.&nbsp;<br /><br />These are incredible gifts, but I think one of the most precious blessings from the Holy Ghost is that he gives us knowledge and understanding. When the Holy Ghost teaches us, we know it is true. Brigham Young declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no doubt, if a person lives according to the revelations given to God's people, he may have the Spirit of God to signify to him His will, and to guide him and direct him in the discharge of his duties, in his temporal as well as his spiritual exercises. I am satisfied however, that in this respect, we live far beneath our privileges.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to illustrate an example of living up to our privileges. I have permission to share a valuable insight a friend gained from a conversation with Elder Bednar when he was president of Ricks College as it developed into Brigham Young University-Idaho.&nbsp; She asked him, "How did you handled the stress of having the prophet say, 'You are the president of a two year school. Now figure out how to make it a four year university'?"&nbsp;<br /><br />He responded, "You are looking at that really funny. What I heard was 'You are the president of the Lord's two year college. Now He wants you to be the president of His university. Ask Him how and He will tell you'--and He did".&nbsp;<br /><br />He shared with her a valuable pattern for receiving answers to prayer that he had been taught by Elder LeGrande Richards, and he told her that he had done this for 30 years.&nbsp; He opened his planner to a page with questions listed on one side. Those were the questions he needed to answer. During the day he would do everything he could to find the answers. Then, when he would pray at night, he would bring those questions to Heavenly Father. He would ask Him for the answers and promise that tomorrow he would give Heavenly Father his first and his best. Then in the morning, he would write down the answers that would come to him.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />How do we fail to be blessed by this greatest gift of inspiration from the Holy Ghost in this life?&nbsp; One way is that we compare our challenges with others and begin to doubt that we are loved, that we will be given our desires, or that we are worthy of blessings. We ask why our desires aren't being granted if we are living the commandments and being obedient. It is the reality of life, that you won't always get that dream job, or the young man or woman you deeply love may not return that love, or the young woman you wish to spend eternity with may gently say no to your proposal. You may find yourself alone in those golden years and all of the plans for retirement vanish in an instant.&nbsp;<br /><br />A friend told me a Relief Society sister was complaining to her that life was too hard. One of her five children refused to attend church and her husband was making life difficult. My friend confided to me, "Do you know what I would give to have her trials? That would mean I had a husband and a family."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify to you today that such negative thoughts will drive away the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; As Brigham Young University's 2013 Women's Week speaker, Lori Rosenlof explained, "While Heavenly Father and our Savior love us no matter what, the Holy Ghost cannot accept invitations to personal pity parties. He cannot."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;C. S. Lewis understood our desire for our lives to be happy:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We want, in fact, not so much a Father in Heaven as a grandfather in heaven--a senile benevolence who, as they say, 'liked to see young people enjoying themselves', and whose plan for the universe was simply that it might be truly said at the end of the day, 'a good time was had by all'. . . . I should like very much to live in a universe which was governed on such lines. But since it is abundantly clear that I don't, and since I have reason to believe, nevertheless, that God is Love, I conclude that my conception of love needs correction.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn12" target="_self">12</a></sup></p>
<p>I know that in any circumstances, when the Holy Ghost gives you the knowledge that you are loved, worthy, and entitled to blessings, you cannot doubt it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A second way we fail to feel blessed is by giving God a timeline. I have a darling three-year-old grandson named Dalan. His family arrived at my home late one night after a seven hour drive. My exhausted daughter wanted to sleep in the next morning, but Dalan did not. He jumped on her bed very early and said, "Wake up mommy; I'm hungry."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She opened one eye and said, "Oh, Dalan, I am so tired. Just give me five more minutes."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To her surprise, he said "Ok." Then he leaned down and whispered in her ear, "one, two, three, four, five. I did it mommy. I gave you five minutes."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He was so cute she just had to get up with him. I think that sometimes our perception of time is close to Dalan's. We tell God that we have waited for five, ten, or even twenty years and that is long enough. We think God asks too much of us. What if Columbus had finally told God that he knew he was inspired with the idea to sail west and he knew he had been told he would succeed. However, he had been doing everything he could to accomplish this for almost six years--and that was long enough. We need to be faithful, patient and know that we will be blessed.&nbsp;<br /><br />A third way we deny ourselves the blessings of the Holy Ghost is that we listen when the prompting and revelation deals with serving someone else, but fail to listen when it requires a change in our lives. Years ago I was serving in a stake Relief Society here on campus. I was driving home late one Sunday afternoon when I noticed a young woman standing on the sidewalk and received the strong prompting to pull over and offer her a ride. I pulled over, rolled down the widow and asked her if she would like a ride. She looked at me for a minute, then she said yes. She told me where she lived and I drove her to the steps of her apartment. She thanked me but didn't say more.&nbsp;<br /><br />I spoke in stake conference the next Sunday and I received a card from her during the week. She said she didn't share her experience with me that day because she didn't know who I was. She had had knee surgery and as she was walking home, her knee began to hurt so terribly she knew she would be unable to make it to her apartment. She prayed and asked Heavenly Father to either lessen the pain so she could stand to walk on her leg, or to send someone to give her a ride. She said, "I opened my eyes and there you were. You are the fastest answer to a prayer I have ever had." I was grateful I had been blessed to receive that prompting.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, I also received some direction from the Holy Ghost that was not as easy to follow. I had developed the habit of turning on the television at night and I was watching more than I should. The words came into my mind very clearly telling me to turn off the television and to be wise in the way I used my time. That was not as easy for me to follow. The importance of responding to guidance was emphasized by former General Relief Society President Julie B. Beck, "The ability to qualify for, receive and act on personal revelation is the single most important skill that can be obtained in this life."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Understanding this concept, we need to ask ourselves how can we continuously invite the Holy Ghost into our lives? We need to acknowledge that God is guiding us with love. We need to following the counsel in D &amp; C 101:16:&nbsp; "Therefore let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition, we need to live our lives so that our priorities are clear and we don't get distracted. Church President Ezra Taft Benson was asked by the President of the United States to greet the president of one of the newest republics of 88 million people scattered on some three thousand islands a thousand miles long. He greeted the guests and visited with them, but looking out the window he said, "I could see the soft lights around our glorious Los Angeles temple. . . I pointed it out. . . and thought, much of what goes on tonight is simply the froth of life. The things that are important are those things represented in the temple of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We must not get too caught up in the froth of life and become casual about the important things that keep this precious gift of God in our lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />May I leave you with the testimony of President Boyd K. Packer given in the last April conference? He counseled:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each of us must stay in condition to respond to inspiration and the promptings of the Holy Ghost. The Lord has a way of pouring pure intelligence into our minds to prompt us, to guide us, to teach us, and to warn us. Each son or daughter of God can know the things they need to know instantly. Learn to receive and act on inspiration and revelation.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_13_Steiner.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Both President Packer and Sister Beck emphasize that this is a skill which we must develop.&nbsp;<br /><br />I pray that we may all show our gratitude for the gift of the Holy Ghost by following President Packer's admonition to learn to receive and act on the personal inspiration we are blessed to receive.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While speaking in the October 2001 General Conference of the Church, Elder Steven E. Snow of the Seventy told of an experience his younger brother, Paul, then 18, had while working in a gas station in St. George, Utah.<br /><br />"One summer day, a car with New York license plates pulled in the station and asked for a fill-up...While Paul was washing the windshield, the driver asked him how far it was to the Grand Canyon. Paul replied that it was 170 miles.&nbsp;<br /><br />"I've waited all my life to see the Grand Canyon," the man exclaimed. "What's it like out there?"&nbsp;<br /><br />"I don't know," Paul answered. "I've never been there."&nbsp;<br /><br />"You mean to tell me," the man responded, "that you live two and a half hours from one of the Seven Wonders of the World and you've never been there!"&nbsp;<br /><br />"That's right," Paul said.&nbsp;<br /><br />After a moment, the man replied, "Well, I guess I can understand that. My wife and I have lived in Manhattan for over twenty years, and we've never visited the Statue of Liberty."&nbsp;<br /><br />"<em>I've</em>&nbsp;been&nbsp;<em>there</em>," Paul said.&nbsp;<br /><br />Isn't it ironic...that we will often travel many miles to see the wonders of nature or the creations of man, but yet ignore the beauty in our own backyard?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I wish to speak concerning one of these oft-ignored forms of backyard beauty. I will refer to them as "backyard sermons." Let me explain what I mean by the term "backyard sermons": While the "sermons" I share with you today were literally taught to me while working in my own backyard, I want to make it clear that these sermons are not solely delivered in backyards any more than Elder Snow meant for us to understand that the Grand Canyon was literally situated behind his house when he referred to it as being in his backyard. By referring to these sermons as "backyard," I simply wish to point out their universal and accessible nature.&nbsp;<br /><br />Secondly, I refer to them as sermons because they are--while generally inaudible to our physical ears--very real and very carefully packaged, individualized messages from God that can be perceived only through our spiritual ears. Certainly in these sermons we find an application for the Savior's words, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;In my opinion, it was to backyard sermons that Alma was referring when he testified to Korihor:&nbsp;<br /><br />I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come...behold, I have&nbsp;<em>all things as a testimony</em>&nbsp;that these things are true; and&nbsp;<em>ye also have all things</em>&nbsp;as a testimony unto you that they are true... ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets...the scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and&nbsp;<em>all things denote there is a God</em>; (denote means signify, demonstrate, show, and all things means all things--the people we meet, animals, plants, rocks, experiences)&nbsp;<em>yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it</em>, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma here testified to Korihor that both he and Korihor&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;been the recipients of backyard sermons. We can take Korihor's later confession that he "always knew that there was a God"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;as evidence that he had indeed heard but disregarded these backyard sermons.&nbsp;<br /><br />To further understand backyard sermons, we can look in the preface of the Doctrine and Covenants, where it states, "the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Given that the missionaries and the words of the prophets have yet to reach all the ends of the earth, I submit that one way that the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth is through these backyard sermons--messages from God found in our everyday world. The Lord further elaborated on this means of communication by saying,&nbsp;<br /><br />"How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind,...and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long..., and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!"<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a>&nbsp;</sup>An additional witness of backyard sermons as a divine form of communication is found in hymn eighty-seven in our hymnbook, which we will sing at the conclusion of this meeting, which states:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Earth, with her ten thousand flow'rs,<br />Air, with all its beams and show'rs,<br />Heaven's infinite expanse,<br />Sea's resplendent countenance--<br />All around and all above<br />Bear this record: God is love."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I would echo that the message "God is love" is certainly one of the most prevalent themes in backyard sermons.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now that I have certified scripturally the existence of what I call backyard sermons, I wish to share a few recent ones from my own personal experience to give further evidence of their existence.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sermon 1: Mortality is messy, but God has made the necessary arrangements to clean up the mess.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />Not infrequently I will venture out my back door into the yard and think to myself, "Whoa!&nbsp; What happened here? Didn't I just mow that grass? It needs it again already? And those weeds? I swear that I just pulled those a couple days ago." I have learned firsthand that the Lord wasn't kidding when He told Adam, "cursed is the ground for thy sake; in&nbsp;<em>sorrow</em>&nbsp;shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;&nbsp;Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee...In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;In fact, it has always seemed to me that the curse of the fall was particularly pronounced on my property.&nbsp;<br /><br />On one occasion as I was feeling these frustrations with my fallen, telestial terrain, a backyard sermon began. It was from the perspective of God, but interestingly, it came in the words of Mr. Incredible (you know, from the animated motion picture) when he said, "No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved! You know, for a little bit? I feel like the maid; I just cleaned up this mess! Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />It came to my mind that the great Gardener, God, could possibly look at us as mortals at times and, in exasperation think to Himself, "didn't I just clean up this mess?&nbsp; Didn't I already eradicate&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>particular weed from your life? Didn't I just mow you down to help you become the beautiful lawn I intended you to be a week ago and yet here you have raised your haughty head again?" Particularly in the case of lawn mowing (which is more or less a weekly activity), I find an interesting parallel to the sacrament--our weekly spiritual "lawn mowing".&nbsp; Fortunately, the Gardener is more patient than Mr. Incredible and doesn't seem to get too tired of cleaning up our messes; on the contrary, He seems to derive a great deal of pleasure from it--after all, our salvation and exaltation are not just His work, but His glory.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;He enjoys the yard work.&nbsp;<br /><br />So the next time we feel particularly messy and mortal and frustrated with our personal progress--knowing that we are full of weeds and feeling like we can't look the Gardener in the face--we should take heart in remembering that the Gardener knew we would require frequent maintenance.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am reminded of an experience with my earthly father. My brother, a friend and I had been fishing early in the spring at Hawkins Reservoir near my boyhood home in Marsh Valley.&nbsp; After an afternoon of fishing, we had decided to take a more scenic, adventurous dirt road that weaved its way through the mountains to get home instead of the safe, certain paved road that went around the mountains, which we had taken to get&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;the reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Spring had not yet melted all of the snow at those high elevations and as we made our way through the mountains, the drifts became progressively deeper and deeper as we climbed higher and higher. Several times my brother hinted that he, as the driver, thought it best to turn back and take the safe route but then I or my friend would simply say something like "Yeah. It's okay. We didn't think&nbsp;<em>your Jeep&nbsp;</em>could make it." These well-placed, foolish taunts were all that were needed to compel my brother forward with each drift of snow getting deeper than the last until eventually we made the capstone of foolish decisions: We came to a point where the snow was very deep&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;the road, so naturally we chose to&nbsp;<em>leave the road</em>&nbsp;and drop into a valley which we knew met up with the road again on the other side of the valley.&nbsp;<br /><br />There we met our Waterloo. We sped down one side of the valley in the Jeep, but the very momentum that we hoped would carry us through the little valley full of snow to the road on the other side only served to embed us completely and thoroughly in deep, drifted snow. We dug for several hours but eventually realized we were not getting the Jeep out of that valley that day. We had also become very wet and cold. Ultimately, we decided to just build a fire, spend the night there and hike out in the morning.&nbsp;<br /><br />After a few hours spent drying out, we climbed in the Jeep to sleep until daylight, and, in spite of the cold, we fell asleep. To our surprise, however, at about 4 a.m., we awoke to a flashlight shining in the Jeep window. It was my Dad. (My Dad had arrived home at midnight after working the swing shift at the local plant to find my mother panicking that her two boys were missing).&nbsp;<br /><br />Now while we were glad to see him, my brother and I had been on the receiving end of his discipline enough times that we were not<em>too</em>&nbsp;eager to see him and we knew he would not be pleased with us, so little was said as we began to hike out. Eventually, however, my curiosity got the best of me because we hadn't told anybody where we were going--family members knew we had gone fishing and that was about it. So eventually I mustered the courage to ask "How did you find us, Dad?" His response has stuck with me to this day: "I just looked for the stupidest road around and knew you boys would be up it." (What's worse is that he said it with a completely straight face!)&nbsp;<br /><br />Similarly, God, in His omniscience, knew that we were going to take some stupid roads; and, like my father, He is willing to go up those roads to rescue us. Furthermore, God knew that one rescue or cleaning up would not suffice. The very institution of the sacrament as a&nbsp;<em>weekly</em>&nbsp;ordinance should serve as a reminder that the Great Gardener, in His infinite foreknowledge, knew that we would require not just one cleaning up but frequent maintenance in order to get us ship-shape and worthy for His kingdom and therefore He provided the Atonement of His Beloved Son and the Holy Sacrament as a means for us to have frequent, even weekly, access to that Atonement.&nbsp;<br /><br />So when you feel messy and frustrated with your ability to maintain yourself in good condition from one weekly sacramental mowing to the next, take heart and remember the words of Elder Packer, who said, "Repent, and, if necessary, repent again and again and again and again until you--not the enemy--are in charge of you.&nbsp; Life turns out to be a succession of trials and errors. Add 'repent often' to your list of things to do."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />One last cautionary thought from this sermon: God is the Gardener and His work and His glory is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life and to clean up our mortal messes but this does not give us carte blanche to go seeking out<em>&nbsp;</em>stupid roads or to recklessly say of our spiritual selves, "I can make any mess I want and God will clean it up later." Unlike a lawn, we have our agency to determine what we will become and God honors that agency. If we make telestial or terrestrial choices with our terrain, He will not do celestial maintenance on it.<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sermon 2: Creation is Generally Pain-stakingly Slow But Rewarding; Destruction is Quick But Unfulfilling.</strong><br />This sermon was taught to me earlier this summer when I cut down two large pine trees in my backyard that were approximately twenty-five and forty feet in height. I enlisted the help of a "crack" team of veteran lumberjacks to help me with the project (you can see from the images of my children that they were a rough and rowdy bunch). The trees had probably been planted when the home was newly built in 1973.&nbsp;<br /><br />The thought occurred to me in the middle of the process that literally in a matter of hours I was destroying what had taken forty years to create. (Another backyard sermon was under way). To my mind came other things which had been built laboriously over time only to be destroyed in moments.&nbsp;<br /><br />I thought of King David's marriage, kingdom and exaltation all consumed in his lust for Bath-Sheba; Abel's mortal life and Cain's eternal prospects were quickly dispatched in that first case of fratricide; and Thomas B. Marsh's standing in the Church was quickly diminished due to one little milky mess. Surely we can all think of instances in our personal lives or the lives of those dear to us where years of building have been destroyed in moments.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I continued to work towards toppling the trees I thought of the precious shade, life-giving photosynthesis and two big, beautiful conifers that were home to squirrels and birds that would now be gone. The destructive consequences of my actions became particularly poignant when, upon finally getting to the lower branches of one of the trees, I watched a dove fly out of her nest as it tumbled from its resting place and her eggs broke upon the ground--the mother had waited until the last possible moment to abandon her nest and eggs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I still stand by my decision to cut the trees down, but in that moment I felt the Spirit reminding me that there are always victims left in the wake of destructive actions and that few worthwhile things are ever accomplished overnight or in an instant. It should be a great life lesson to all of us that God's works--including Creation, Atonement, Exaltation and Salvation--require painstaking, deliberate effort and that they take place over time in perfect order until all is finally in place.&nbsp;<br /><br />Similarly, in our lives, corn is not planted and then harvested in a single day and eternal families aren't created in one FHE. Being a builder and a creator and emulating The Creator in this life generally means steady, patient, laborious work. Conversely, those who want everything now and are willing to take shortcuts are not true builders.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan is the king of shortcuts. He is the ultimate embodiment of wanting it all now without paying the proper price, as found in his proposal to "redeem all mankind," by "destroying the agency of man" and his demand to the Father, "give me thine honor"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;He wanted to shortcut the way to godhood and exaltation.&nbsp; Satan didn't comprehend the truism:&nbsp;<em>There are no shortcuts</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Activities like cheating, drug abuse, fornication, participating in get-rich-quick schemes, and even--my personal favorite shortcut in which to indulge--eating fast food, provide quick or instantaneous satisfaction and,&nbsp;<em>ostensibly</em>, happiness. But the destructive nature of these shortcuts soon reveals itself to those who have allowed themselves to be deceived by them. My young brothers and sisters, be builders and creators and be patient in "waiting upon the Lord"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;for the results of your labors. Don't be destroyers and don't get duped into taking shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Sermon 3: By Small &amp; Simple Things Are Great Things Brought To Pass.<br /></strong>Not long ago my daughter, Gracie, pointed out the carcass of a dead wasp moving across our driveway. Upon closer inspection, we discovered a tiny ant--completely eclipsed by the body of the wasp--to be trudging along, bearing the weight of a creature that appeared to be more than ten times its size! I stood in awe, watching this exhibition of strength, determination and grit. (By the way, you may be interested to know that according to Arizona State University's "ask a biologist" an ant&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;<em>lift from ten to fifty times their own body weight</em>).<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I observed this little titan at work, another backyard sermon was instantly under way as I had come to my mind the words: "Why should you wonder at this? God has always used those that would be classified by the world as 'small and simple' or 'weak things' to 'bring to pass His great and eternal purposes' and to 'thresh the nations.'"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;For examples of little individual ants carrying immense loads and accomplishing incredible tasks, one needs look no further than Abinadi, Nephi, or the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp;<br /><br />Indeed, President Hinckley taught that "The major work of the world is not done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people, with balance in their lives, who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;Or in other words, most of the world's work is done by ants.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would further testify that the mission of BYU-Idaho as outlined by prophets and Church leaders is to create an army of these ants, people who can do more with less--ordinary people who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner. So I guess that makes BYU-Idaho an anthill! Listen to the words of President Eyring as he spoke to BYU-Idaho students in a devotional here at the anthill. He said about you:&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope I live long enough to someday meet some employer who employed one of you and says, "Where did that come from? I've never had such a person. Why, people just flock around that person. And they want to follow. They don't have to be led; they're seeking to go where that person wants to go. And they come up with new ideas. I don't know where that comes from. They seem to find a better way, and the budget doesn't go up. I can't understand it." And I'll smile and say, "Well, come with me to Rexburg."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My friends, this is the Lord's anthill and to each one of you I say, "Be an ant."&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I thank you for indulging me and letting me share a few of my backyard sermons with you.&nbsp; But before I conclude, I wish to discuss one more backyard sermon--this one is from the scriptures and Moses was the recipient. In Exodus 3, it reads:&nbsp;<br /><br />"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.&nbsp;And Moses said,&nbsp;<em>I will now turn aside</em>, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.&nbsp;And&nbsp;<em>when the Lord saw that he turned aside</em>&nbsp;to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.&nbsp;And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Please make note of two things from this account: 1) Moses had to turn aside, or to go out of his way, or make an effort, to hear this backyard sermon--the "burning bush" experience that was his call as the prophet of the Exodus and the great Lawgiver of Israel. 2) It was not until God&nbsp;<em>saw</em>&nbsp;that Moses turned aside that He called to Moses.&nbsp;<br /><br />May I just suggest that "backyard sermons," while universal and accessible for all of mankind,&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;require a turning aside from our daily routines? Just as God will force no man to heaven, He will force His word into no man's life. The Holy Ghost will carry the word "unto but not necessarily into the heart"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;of individuals.&nbsp;<br /><br />May I also suggest that the more we show God that we will turn aside and acknowledge backyard sermons in our lives, the more God will speak to us? The poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning knew about "backyard sermons" and understood their accessible yet ignored nature when she penned the lines:<br /><br />Earth's crammed with heaven,And every common bush afire with God;But only he who sees, takes off his shoes,The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that Earth is indeed crammed with heaven! There is heaven in every plant and every animal and every rock and every individual--remember&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>things denote there is a God--and that includes people. Think about it--every person you meet is a testimony that there is a&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;in whose image they are created! Every common bush&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;afire with God, but mankind, like Korihor, rarely sees beyond the blackberries. We live in a world of wonder that shouts to us that God lives and that He is in control and that His plan is at work in nature and in mankind. Listen to the Prophet Joseph's plea for more backyard sermons:&nbsp;<br /><br />Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands&nbsp;<em>tell the wonders</em>&nbsp;of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field&nbsp;<em>praise the Lord</em>; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And&nbsp;<em>let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever</em>!<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_20_Rowe.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that the eternal creations are declaring His name forever and ever and I pray that we may be tuned into those declarations, those backyard sermons. I cannot testify strongly enough to you, my young brothers and sisters, that God is constantly trying to communicate with us--to send us messages that will aid us in our mortal journey. May we have eyes to see and ears to hear when a backyard sermon is being preached and when we recognize one, may we do as Moses and turn aside from the mundane and "put off our shoes" that the Lord may speak to us. May we know that we don't have to wait our whole lives or travel great distances in order to have a spiritual experience or to receive God's word in our lives, because His word is to be found&nbsp;<em>everywhere...in all things...even</em>&nbsp;in our own backyard.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>It is my observation that in our society today, the major stumbling blocks to happiness in this life and in the life to come are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. The law of chasity, and<br />2. Money.</p>
<p>We are going to consider money today, but let's do so while not forgetting the eternal significance of strict obedience to the law of chastity.&nbsp; We should also remember that while we can't take our money with us into the next life, we&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;carry the consequences of our decisions about money with us into the eternities.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, let's be clear that the Lord&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;care about money, and is willing to help us care for it.&nbsp; He warns us that, "the&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;of money is the root of all evil,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;He counseled his disciples to "...Render...unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;He instructed Moses and the children of Israel to bring gold and silver with them out of Egypt, thus despoiling the Egyptians.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; In The Book of Mormon<em>&nbsp;</em>he teaches us about the Nephite coinage system,<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;and repeatedly reminds us that wealth often leads to pride and sin.&nbsp; Our First Presidency has counseled us to consider "...investing wisely with responsible and established financial institutions."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;There have also been innumerable general conference addresses that counsel us about how to care for our money.&nbsp;<br /><br />My family and I learned that the Lord is willing to help us in money matters years ago, while I was in my medical training in Salt Lake City.&nbsp; Sister Davis and I would have our small children say their prayers out loud with us.&nbsp; Our oldest boy, Taylor, gave a rather brief prayer one evening that consisted only of asking the Lord for $10 so he could buy a toy workbench.&nbsp; We both wondered whether a prayer like that was really okay or not, but decided to leave it alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day, our 90-year-old neighbor from across the street, named Jim Downward, knocked on our front door.&nbsp; When Sonja opened the door, he handed her $10 and told her that it was for our little boy.&nbsp; She, of course, was surprised and amazed, and asked Jim why he had done this.&nbsp; He just answered that he didn't know, and then turned around and returned home.&nbsp; Through that experience, we were reminded that the Lord hears and answers his children's prayers, usually through the actions of others.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share with you two stories that illustrate how decisions concerning money can affect us not only in this life, but also in the life to come.&nbsp; Several years ago, I was serving as the Young Men's president in my home ward in Idaho Falls.&nbsp; I worked with several brethren in those years as priest quorum advisors, and one particularly memorable brother appeared to be incredibly wealthy.&nbsp; He and his family lived a very extravagant lifestyle, but sadly, it eventually became known that his wealth was gained dishonestly.&nbsp; He subsequently lost his family, his membership in the Church, and his freedom--being sentenced to serve many years in federal prison.&nbsp; His decisions about money have placed his eternal happiness in grave peril.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share a more positive story.&nbsp; We have a good friend who lives with his family in a modest suburb of Idaho Falls.&nbsp; He and his wife had decided to put their house up for sale and purchase a larger and nicer home up in the foothills.&nbsp; However, he attended the October 1998 general priesthood meeting, and listened carefully to President Hinckley's address when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a portent of stormy weather ahead to which we had better give heed...&nbsp; I urge you, brethren, to look to the condition of your finances. I urge you to be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a part of the temporal gospel in which we believe. May the Lord bless you, my beloved brethren, to set your houses in order.&nbsp; If you have paid your debts, if you have a reserve, even though it be small, then should storms howl about your head, you will have shelter for your wives and children and peace in your hearts. That's all I have to say about it, but I wish to say it with all the emphasis of which I am capable.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>At that point in time in 1998, the US economy was booming, prosperity appeared to abound, and there seemed to be no end in sight.&nbsp; Despite that, however, my friend returned home after that priesthood meeting, and before entering his house he removed the "For Sale" sign from their front yard.&nbsp; He conferred with his wife, and together they decided that they weren't moving, but instead were going to stay put and work hard to get out of debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was almost exactly ten years later, in October 2008, when the US housing market "bubble" burst and the US and world economy entered a severe recession.&nbsp; While he and his family were able to weather that storm, many of their friends in the foothills ended up losing their homes.&nbsp; It was obviously a huge blessing for our friends to be able to keep their home, but I suspect the greater blessings will come from their decision to heed the guidance of the prophet.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are all blessed when we heed the words of the prophets, and it is comforting to know that the Lord warns us in advance of difficult times to come. Our Heavenly Father has told us that "...all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; We can trust the Lord and rely on Him in all things, including money management.&nbsp; Neither of my friends will take their money or homes into the next life, but both will carry the consequences of their decisions about money--for better or for worse--into the eternities with them.&nbsp;<br /><br />We live in a very materialistic society, and money and all it can buy can either be a great blessing to us and our families, or alternatively it can be a major stumbling block.&nbsp; I suppose that we have all heard such sayings as: "The guy who dies with the most toys wins," "Money, if it does not bring you happiness, will at least help you be miserable in comfort,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;and "Lack of money is the root of all evil."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; Many, and perhaps most, Americans want to join Tevya from&nbsp;<em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>&nbsp;in singing "If I Were a Rich Man."&nbsp; The Lord has promised repeatedly that he grants unto His children according to their desires,<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;and if wealth is what we truly desire, He is often willing to let us have it.&nbsp; However, for most of us, becoming rich may well turn out to be spiritually dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Brigham Young said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The worst fear that I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and his people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell. This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty and all manner of persecution, and be true. My greater fear for them is that they cannot stand wealth; and yet they have to be tried with riches, for they will become the richest people on this earth.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The Lord will judge us according to the desire of our hearts.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp; It is easy to become too focused on wealth and lose sight of what is truly important.&nbsp; Money can be a great impediment to our happiness.&nbsp; There is a very interesting way, however, that very well may result, even safely, in greater riches.&nbsp; That is charitable giving.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago, a good friend of ours pointed out to us a very interesting article from BYU's Marriott Alumni Magazine.&nbsp; An economist named Arthur C. Brooks wrote an article entitled "The Privilege of Giving."&nbsp; He tells the story of a poor man in Kansas City who was shopping for clothing in a Salvation Army thrift shop on December 23, 1999.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He had seventy-five cents in his pocket. Suddenly someone approached him from behind and said, 'Excuse me.' He turned around, and a man pushed a hundred-dollar bill into his hand, said, 'Merry Christmas,' and walked away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That wasn't the first time something like this had happened. It had been going on for years, and no one knew the giver's identity. He was only known as Secret Santa. He would walk around during the Christmas season giving money to people who needed food, clothing, or shelter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He came forward in 2006, because he had terminal cancer and was given one month to live. His doctor told him that if he wanted anybody to understand his mission then he should reveal his identity. Secret Santa's real name was Larry Stewart, and he was a very wealthy entrepreneur.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He'd given away $1.3 million in hundred-dollar bills, but he had also given away tens of millions of dollars more in traditional philanthropy--building youth centers, building a YMCA, and helping the community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When the press asked him why he gave so much, he said, 'I'm just doing what the Lord is directing me to do. I'm just a pair of hands and feet. He's using me. He's lighted my path. Part of my daily prayer was, 'Lord, let me be a better servant.' I had no idea this is what he had in mind, but I'm happy. I'm so thrilled he is able to use me in this way.'<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>The author of the BYU article, Arthur C. Brooks, quoted from a study done in 2000 by Harvard, other universities, and community foundations.&nbsp; He expected to find that when people became rich they gave more away, but was surprised to learn that the reverse is also true!&nbsp; When people give money away charitably, they became richer.&nbsp; This rather startling finding seemed to defy all logic, so he repeated the study and arrived at the same result.&nbsp; For every $1 individuals give away, they get a&nbsp;<em>financial</em>&nbsp;return on their "investment" of about $3.75.&nbsp; Psychologists have also scientifically confirmed Larry Stewart's sentiments that giving makes us happy.&nbsp; Those who give and serve smile more, describe themselves as happier, and secrete less stress hormones in their brains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Using this information from Mr. Brooks, let's re-examine the Lord's promise in Malachi 3 verse 10.&nbsp; "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I am not suggesting that we pay tithes and offerings in order to make more money, but I have a strong testimony that the Lord has blessed our family financially and in many other ways because we have.&nbsp; Remember that the Lord does seem to care about money, but He doesn't&nbsp;<em>need&nbsp;</em>our money.&nbsp; What He needs is our obedience in order to be able to bless us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma also teaches the connection between charitable giving and wealth in Alma chapter 1, when he tells us that the righteous had become very wealthy because of their faithfulness:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need...And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.&nbsp; And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, specifically speaking to us in our day, the Lord chastises us when he says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted...Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jacob, earlier in The Book of Mormon, taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.&nbsp; And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Let's consider a great modern example of charitable giving.&nbsp; Jon Huntsman is a multibillionaire, an emeritus member of the 70, and a dedicated philanthropist.&nbsp; Of the more than 1,200 living billionaires in the world, he is one of only nineteen who has donated at least $1 billion to charitable causes.&nbsp; Huntsman's philanthropic causes include the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, one of the world's finest cancer treatment and research facilities, but his charitable giving has been much more extensive than even that great undertaking.&nbsp; It may sound like an easy thing for a billionaire to give, but the Huntsmans began doing so long before they became wealthy.&nbsp; By giving charitably, they showed the Lord that they sought wealth for the intent to do good.&nbsp; After college, Elder Huntsman served in the US Navy, earning $320 a month.&nbsp; They tithed $32, and in addition, gave away another $50 to the Navy Relief Fund.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp; During a severe economic downturn that began in 2001, the Huntsmans came very close to losing everything.&nbsp; However, they kept giving, even taking out loans for hundreds of millions of dollars in order to meet their philanthropic commitments.<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Philanthropy Magazine</em>, in its Summer 2013 edition, wrote that,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is easy to think of philanthropy as something done by the very wealthy, or big foundations, or prosperous companies. Actually, of the more than $300 billion that Americans give to charity every year, ...the vast predominance of offerings comes from average citizens of moderate income.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn20" target="_self">20</a></sup></p>
<p>I am&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;recommending that the rest of us take out loans in order to give the money away.&nbsp; But, I am inspired by Elder Huntsman's determination to do good and be true to his word, despite experiencing an intense financial reversal of fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Last May, Sister Davis and I were incredibly touched and inspired by a short video segment we saw at the BYU President's dinner that told the story of a young married student in Provo named Brian Ricks who was challenged to give back to BYU.&nbsp; I must admit that Sister Davis and I both related a lot to his circumstances. We also were poor students, and probably similarly would have wondered if it were even possible to start giving back to BYU while we were still students.&nbsp; However, Brian accepted the challenge, and he and his family made it a matter of prayer.&nbsp; He entered an essay contest and won $675--then promptly gave it back to BYU.&nbsp; He said something very insightful about his experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Maybe the reason they asked us as students, even as freshmen, to give to BYU was not because they needed the money, but because they wanted to give us this blessing of giving.&nbsp; They wanted us to have this optimism that comes from giving away.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn21" target="_self">21</a></sup></p>
<p>We are inspired by his faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share a few more lessons that we in the Davis family have learned about money.&nbsp; Sister Davis took a terrible chance, and married me--four weeks after I returned from my mission.&nbsp; Yes, we had met before my mission.&nbsp; At the time of our marriage, I had completed only two semesters of college, and it eventually turned out that I had another 12 years of education remaining before I could actually begin practicing as a physician.&nbsp; The only things we really possessed at the time of our marriage were a few wedding presents, a car we had borrowed from her father, some cast-off furniture, and a lot of ignorance.&nbsp; I must admit that we didn't have the first clue about how we were going to pay for all those years of school.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What we didn't learn at first was that we were poor, because we really didn't want much.&nbsp; Sonja worked as a seamstress, at $4.35 per hour, until our first child joined our family 16 months after we were married.&nbsp; After that, she stayed home to be a full-time Mom.&nbsp; That required me to step up to the plate and support our family, and we soon learned that it was a privilege for me to be able to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Most of my medical school classmates had wives that worked, and many were also being helped financially by parents.&nbsp; My parents&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;willing to help, and did offer to do so.&nbsp; However, we wanted to be independent.&nbsp; I kept telling myself that this was a good idea, even when I saw that my classmates had things like cars that would actually start when the ignition key was turned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There were months that we wondered how we were going to pay the rent, but we learned that when we were approaching serious financial trouble the Lord blessed us.&nbsp; These blessings took the form of an opportunity for me to work.&nbsp; The first check we always wrote was for our tithing, and everything else worked out.&nbsp; It almost got to the point where we didn't really worry about it.&nbsp; When the figures in our checkbook were hovering at or below zero, I was always able to find work that allowed us to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We learned how to budget, and literally didn't spend a dime that we didn't absolutely have to.&nbsp; From time to time I must admit that I would look at my classmates doing things like buying chocolate bars from vending machines, and rather wistfully wondered what it would be like to be able to do things like that.&nbsp; However, we managed to stick to our budget.&nbsp; I would probably have just become fat if I had indulged a chocolate habit.&nbsp;<br /><br />We also learned from our families.&nbsp; For instance, we were greatly blessed by the instruction we received from Sonja's father.&nbsp; Many times he taught us that there are only three reasons to borrow money:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp; For an education,<br />2.&nbsp; To start a business, and<br />3.&nbsp; To purchase a home.</p>
<p>It did get to the point that we really needed a car that could handle our growing family, so we did rather reluctantly finance the purchase of one minivan.&nbsp; We enjoyed the car a lot, but those payments were truly miserable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We did borrow money to get through school, but we learned that when we had to borrow money we did so conservatively, and then paid those debts off as soon as possible.&nbsp; I did worry a lot about being able to repay those educational loans, but they were quickly dwarfed in comparison to the size of the loans I had to take out to get my practice started.&nbsp; Once my practice was up and running, we were greatly blessed.&nbsp; Eventually, all those years of educational debt ended up amounting to be the equivalent of just over three months of practice overhead.&nbsp; I will be eternally grateful that I didn't take our children's mother out of our home for all those years in order to save three months of practice overhead.&nbsp; What at times seemed like a sacrifice while we were in school has turned out to be one of the best decisions we have ever made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We have learned that the most rewarding thing we do with our money is to give it away.&nbsp; In the Church we have abundant opportunities to give, including tithing, fast offerings, the Perpetual Education Fund, humanitarian aid, the Temple Patron Assistance Fund, and the General Missionary Fund.&nbsp; There is no better value in charitable giving than the Church.&nbsp; We have a good friend, who is a stockbroker and not a member of our faith, who has a number of non-member clients that contribute to the Church's humanitarian aid fund, because 100% of their contributions are used to help the poor.&nbsp; Winston Churchill once said, "We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_8_27_Davis.htm#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Before I finish, perhaps I should state the obvious.&nbsp; My salary here at BYU-Idaho is less than what I used to make as a practicing physician.&nbsp; I will state another, probably equally obvious fact and say that if my statement about my salary surprises any of you, perhaps a career in business may not be in your best interests.&nbsp; I planned to practice medicine for decades, but a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis ended my medical career long before I wanted to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, the Lord prepared us for our change in income. We had long since paid off all of our debts, as I have said, and we had saved diligently for the future.&nbsp; Both Sister Davis and I felt the guidance of the Spirit as He helped us live in a provident fashion, and prepared us for our future drop in income. Even now, however, I still make far more than Sonja's $4.35 per hour salary when we were newlyweds.&nbsp; No matter our income, whether great or small, our true happiness has always been found in the gospel and with our family.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of us in this room have been blessed by BYU-Idaho, and I, for one, will never be able to repay our Father in Heaven for His goodness--including the privilege of being able to work and serve here.&nbsp; The only way the Lord can know that we seek riches in order to do good is to actually do good with the wealth we have now.&nbsp; Let me repeat that.&nbsp; The only way the Lord can know that we seek riches in order to do good is to actually do good with the wealth we have now.&nbsp; Remember, the Lord doesn't need our money, but He does desire to bless us for the righteous use of money.&nbsp; For some, and perhaps most of us, it will be the widow's mite, but that is fine with the Lord.&nbsp; We won't take either our wealth or our debts into the next life, but we will all carry the consequences of our decisions in these matters with us as we return home to Him whose children we are.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my testimony that our family has been richly blessed by the Lord through paying tithes and offerings; and trying our best to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and lift up the downtrodden. Let us join forces with our Savior and Redeemer and go forth in doing good, in whatever fashion we can, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>My purpose in speaking in devotional today is to testify of our Heavenly Father's love for us evident in the natural and spiritual laws that govern the power of renewal.&nbsp; Although we all have the inherent gift of resilience because of our divine nature, we sometimes forget how to renew ourselves.&nbsp; We have difficulty tapping into that God given gift of spiritual strength and hardiness we all possess.<br /><br />The scriptures reassure us of this gift. In Psalms we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.&nbsp;He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.&nbsp;He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.&nbsp;Yea, though I<sup>&nbsp;</sup>walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Christ taught and exemplified the power of resilience, the ability to recover quickly from setbacks. A woman brought to Him having been caught in the very act of adultery is anticipating certain death by stoning. After teaching the accusers about judging, he then asks this of the woman: "Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a><em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br />Go and sin no more sounds a lot like - recover quickly from this setback - it sounds like instruction to be resilient.&nbsp; Time and time again, he lifts those who are sick, sorrowful, oppressed, or sinful and instructs them to "rise", "walk", "tell", or " feed my sheep." He does not tell them to mope around a little more because life is pretty hard, but He encourages them by reminding them of His love, their purpose in this life and His promised divine help.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have been commanded to "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect".<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Yet do we really understand what perfection means in the eyes of our Heavenly Father? The footnote to the word&nbsp;<em>perfect</em>&nbsp;in this scripture tells us that the Greek translation for this word is "complete, finished, or fully developed." Our road to perfection is a journey toward becoming fully developed, like our Heavenly Father. But when we perceive perfection as being "without error or mistake" life becomes frustrating, very discouraging and sometimes frightening.&nbsp;<br /><br />Amulek teaches in Alma chapter 34, that we don't have a whole lot of time to brood about the setbacks we experience in life.&nbsp; He teaches:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors<em>.</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the beautiful parables and metaphors the Savior used in His teaching. Because of my own personal affinity to anything in the outdoors, I love the stories of lilies of the field, olive trees, seeds sown in soil, gardeners, and sheep. How many lessons were taught on mountains, a stormy sea, and in a sacred garden?&nbsp; Alma knew that all things testify of Christ. He taught Korihor that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator<em>.</em><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I have spent my life living in some of the most spectacularly beautiful natural places in the world. In each of these uniquely different places I have witnessed the power of renewal and resilience evident in the natural world around me. The plants and animals live true to the design of their creator.&nbsp;<br /><br />During my elementary school years I grew up at the foot of Mount Graham in Southeastern Arizona. Near the top of this 10,000 foot mountain live Douglas Fir trees that are over 700 years old. They are some of the oldest conifer trees in the U.S. Southwest. These trees were young saplings before Columbus even thought of sailing to the Americas. I marvel at the adaptations these trees have had to make through the seasons of drought, flood, blizzard, wildfire and every other natural event that could happen during many centuries. Yet through it all they have remained a living entity capable of absorbing the necessities of life from the sun, soil and moisture in order to generate new growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the age of ten my parents moved our family from the Gila Valley in Arizona to Hawaii where my father was employed as a veterinarian for the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture. My parents bought a house in Kailua on the island of Oahu. As a teenager I never saw green sea turtles off of the beach at my parent's house. The green sea turtle's historic nesting sites were in the Hawaiian Islands, but through a variety of circumstances their numbers had dwindled to near extinction. Through protective measures taken in the 1970's, the green sea turtles have made a comeback and now I can see green sea turtles from my mother's dining room window almost any time I look out at the ocean. The comeback was only possible because some of those green sea turtles were tough. They survived some serious setbacks. A green sea turtle can live to be 80 years old. It is amazing to imagine what a sea turtle might experience in an ocean during 80 years. What modifications might they have had to make to ensure their survival as their traditional nesting sites and habitat changed?&nbsp;<br /><br />While I was a student at BYU in Provo I was hired as an instructor for the Ricks College Biology Department's Discovery expeditions and I was introduced to the spectacular beauty of Idaho. My first exposure was on a whitewater rafting trip on the Salmon River through the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return. This wilderness area of over 2 million acres is the second largest wilderness area in the lower 48 states. This was so different from my other two homes, but equally beautiful and amazing. I was in awe of the wildlife and the solitude.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have spent a lot of time in the Salmon River country since my first experience there. It has remained the same in many ways, but things have changed also. This wilderness can experience varying amounts of precipitation each year. There might be a series of years when there is a drought or a year of deep snowpack with its resulting spring flooding. It is fascinating to watch a river or stream channel change as a result of a high water year, a rock fall, a fire and to see how the ecosystem adjusts and adapts.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have since made my home here in Rexburg, Idaho. I can see the Teton Mountains from my kitchen window and marvel during every sunrise, sunset and night sky that I experience in this beautiful place.&nbsp; My career has allowed me to have profound experiences with these places. I have been privileged to come to know these places of natural beauty in a deeply personal way.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is hard to describe what feelings are evoked by being in nature, but these feelings are often described as being spiritual. The world would define spiritual as a concept of an ultimate, sacred and divine force. The natural world creates a spiritual emotion for many reasons: the vastness, the following of mysterious natural laws, the great diversity and uniqueness of the different species, and the solitude.&nbsp; But for me, the great spiritual lesson from nature is that of adaptation to change and the perpetuation of life.&nbsp; Basically, Heavenly Father's creations are designed by him to be masters of renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite winter snows and sub-zero temperatures, a small delicate flower called a spring beauty pushes up from the recently melted snow bank and blossoms in the Teton Mountains. In the middle of an Arizona drought, tough lizards of the Sonoran desert find water and food and carry on. After a wildfire burns a mature forest to blackened stumps, small herbaceous plants emerge from the blackened forest floor after the fire.&nbsp;<br /><br />That same God who created these beautiful environments and the species that inhabit them also created us. He endowed us with the same abilities of physical renewal. I have experienced many times the miracle of physical renewal. Numerous times I have experienced profound fatigue from a demanding peak ascent, an extended backpacking trip over challenging terrain, or a challenging experience with an early snow storm. My privilege as a mother has sometimes involved late nights with a baby or sick child when I was already physically and mentally exhausted from my own work performed that day. Yet our God given ability to renew our bodies physically is astonishing. It is amazing how different the world seems after a good night's sleep and good nutrition.We have all experienced the miracle of physical healing from injury and illness. Even at the time of death there is the promise of physical renewal through the resurrection. My mother passed away last November. For the last six years of her life she needed full time caregivers due to her cognitive decline.&nbsp; In her earlier years she was a middle school earth science teacher. It was hard to watch her struggle with memory loss and the inability sometimes to express herself or to even make simple daily living decisions. It was very hard for me, her daughter, to switch roles with her. It was hard for her too. I knew she was not going to get better. Sometimes our mortal bodies have done their work and they experience what they are meant to experience in mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />At my father's graveside service, six years before my mother's death, a friend brought about 20 homing pigeons whose wings had been dyed beautiful colors of the rainbow. They were released at the end of the service and we marveled at the beautiful ribbon of color they made as they flew in a beautiful pattern on their way home.&nbsp;<br /><br />My mother remarked to me, "At my funeral, forget the flowers, I want those birds." So when it came time for my mother's graveside service we made arrangements for the birds. After the dedication of the grave, the birds were released. We watched them fly together against the dark green backdrop of the beautiful Koolau Mountains and then were shocked to see the birds form the shape of a heart. The funeral director was standing next to me and she said in a hushed voice, "Did you see that! The birds made a heart!" I wasn't quite sure I had seen it myself, but when she said that I knew that I had seen it. For me this was a message of renewal from my mother and my Heavenly Father. My mother was renewed. She was free.&nbsp;<br /><br />As miraculous as our physical renewal is, our God given ability for spiritual renewal is central to God's plan for our happiness. How do we become spiritually renewed? What do we need to rebound from spiritual challenges? What keeps us from being resilient in the face of spiritual setbacks? Sometimes it is the imperfections in this life that keep us from being in a renewed state. We expect life to happen exactly as we have pictured our life to happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will forever be grateful to my mother who, despite her cognitive and physical limitations, which she had no control over, she maintained a gracious and grateful disposition. The last time I was able to visit her; I was getting ready to catch my flight home the last evening I was there.&nbsp; My mother had had a difficult and confusing day so I was letting her caregivers get her ready for bed in order to keep things more familiar for her. I stood by the open door to her bedroom as her caregiver tucked her in for the night. Her caregiver pulled up her blanket and said warmly, "Good night Rita" and kissed her gently on the forehead. As the caregiver turned to leave, my mother caught her hand. She said, "Thank you for helping me. When I get to heaven I am going to tell them how good you have been to me."&nbsp; The last words I heard my mother speak were words of gratitude and concern for her caregiver despite of her awareness of her physical and cognitive weakness. This is resilience.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are all painfully aware of our weaknesses and imperfections. We have been taught that Heavenly Father strengthens us through this awareness of our weaknesses:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>So here is the first step in spiritual renewal and resilience, humility and an awareness of aspects of our life that need some work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A resilient person recognizes their weakness.</strong><br /><br />This can be very discouraging.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lyle J Burrup in a recent Ensign article advised parents on how to teach their children to be resilient.&nbsp; He wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As children become resilient, they understand and accept these two facts. They see life as challenging and ever changing, but they believe they can cope with those challenges and changes. They view mistakes and weaknesses as opportunities to learn, and they accept that losing may precede winning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As children develop resilience, they believe they can influence and even control outcomes in their lives through effort, imagination, knowledge, and skill. With this attitude, they focus on what they can do rather than on what is outside their control<em>.</em><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup></p>
<p>So here is a second step to spiritual renewal, the recognition of our strengths, our ability to control our destiny through our own effort, knowledge and skill. We also have to recognize that we do not gain this knowledge and skill without challenge and effort. It is through experience that we learn and develop new capabilities.&nbsp;<strong>A resilient person recognizes their strengths and uses them.</strong><br /><br />Many of us, however, freeze in fear and discouragement when faced with a challenge that seems beyond our capabilities. We focus on what we cannot control instead of what we can control. Some years ago, I took professional development leave to help do research for the Department of Conservation in New Zealand. My husband and our three teenagers set out on a grand three month adventure in the southern hemisphere. In New Zealand, drivers drive on the other side of the road. When we had purchased a mini-van for our family, I asked a New Zealand friend to ride with me as I got used to driving on the left side of the road.&nbsp; We started out on some quiet residential streets and a little busier road with some oncoming traffic.&nbsp;<br /><br />All went well. But then we came to a two lane round about. YIKES! All the lanes were full; traffic was traveling fast and coming from four different directions into the round about, in what seemed to me to be the wrong direction. I froze. Traffic began to back up behind me. I just couldn't see how I could get into the round about. I just saw cars and cars and cars coming at me fast. My friend encouragingly and cheerfully said "Go for the gap, Kari, Go for the gap." I started looking for a gap instead of cars. I saw a gap and away I went. That expression has become somewhat of a philosophy of life for me now. When I see perceived obstacles in front of me, I take a deep breath, look for the gap and try to take action.&nbsp;<strong>A resilient person looks for opportunities, not obstacles.</strong><br /><br />Elder Marvin J. Ashton said this about progression and achieving maturity: "Perhaps it is not too far off the mark to say adult conduct is a process. Mature conduct is generally developed through self-discipline,&nbsp;<strong>resilience</strong>, and continuing effort."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Did you catch that? Maturity or becoming fully developed is a process and involves some tough personal effort and resilience and renewal when faced with a challenge. Tough personal effort and resilience is not required in a trouble free life. It is only through the winters, the droughts, the devastating wildfires, and the loss of our nesting places that we can become mature and complete, like our Heavenly Father. Lehi taught his sons, "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />As I reflect on our first parents, Adam and Eve, I am in awe of their resilience and ability to adapt to changes in their situation. Wow, to go from the Garden of Eden to the Lone and Dreary World, that would take some adaptation, some resilience, some renewal.&nbsp; And guess what? We are their descendants; we have their genetic code in us. But we don't need to look as far back as Adam and Eve.&nbsp; I need only look back as far as my own mother to see resilience and renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My father's great grandparents were in the Willy Handcart Company. Peder and Helena Mortensen had planned to come to Zion with their entire family. As they prepared to come to the Valley of the Salt Lake, the mission president in their native Denmark asked if they would leave their oldest son, Morton (my great great grandfather) to serve a mission. This was very difficult for them because Peder (the father) and the oldest daughter Kristine were disabled and not able to walk well. The family was depending on this eldest son to be the strength in getting the family consisting of 8 children to Utah.&nbsp; The youngest child was four years old.&nbsp;<br /><br />The mission president, Hector C. Haight, promised them that "<em>If you will consent to his staying and filling a mission, I promise you in the name of the Lord that you shall every one reach the land of Zion in safety, that God will protect you on the land and on the sea."</em>&nbsp;They accepted his promise with faith, and it was agreed that Morton would remain in Denmark. The family traveled by steamship across the Atlantic, by train to Iowa City and it was there the decision was made to make the journey by handcart with the older children pulling the handcart with father Peder and daughter Kristine and often young 4 year old Caroline in the handcart. I cannot even imagine their struggle on the night of October 19, 1856 when over 18 inches of snow fell. Having run out of food two days earlier, the arrival of the rescue party was a literal answer to their prayers. The second oldest son Anders recorded that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We wept as we went on our journey. We went before the Lord and pleaded for Him to make good the promises which were given to us by His servants when we were in old Denmark. How we implored Him to raise the sick and give us strength to carry our burdens without complaints!</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they still had to endure the agonizing pull up Rocky Ridge and an additional 300 miles to Salt Lake, the family - every one of them - arrived on November 9<sup>th</sup>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This story is one of resilience and renewal and has taught me another step necessary for spiritual renewal - prayer and faith in the promises of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A resilient person relies on the Lord to help overcome challenges.</strong><strong><br /></strong><br />The scriptures and the teachings of our latter day prophets are full of promises we can rely on. Recently I have been intrigued by promises made by living apostles concerning the youth of the church and family history. Elder Bednar in October Conference in 2011 spoke to the youth of the church:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I invite the young people of the Church to learn about and experience the Spirit of Elijah... As you respond in faith to this invitation, your hearts shall turn to the fathers... Your testimony of and conversion to the Savior will become deep and abiding. And I promise you will be protected against the intensifying influence of the adversary. As you participate in and love this holy work, you will be safeguarded in your youth and throughout your lives<em>.</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can be renewed as we act upon the Lord's promises. I know the story of my great great grandparents safeguards me. When faced with challenges that may seem insurmountable in my life, I think about Rocky Ridge and I am strengthened by Peder and Helena and their children. I am strengthened as I review my patriarchal blessing and remind myself of the promises made to me specifically if I do my part<strong>. A resilient person exercises their faith in the Lord's promises.</strong><strong><br /></strong><br />A beautiful promise from the Lord is found in Isaiah. "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />What does it mean to wait upon the Lord? I believe it means all the steps we have been discussing today. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses the Lord has given us, being humble, exercising our faith in his promises through prayer and action, and being patient. Sometimes our most important "action" we can take is to be still and know that he is God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A resilient person is patient.</strong>The power of the Atonement is what enables us to become renewed, resilient and ultimately to experience joy. Darrin Cozzens commented in his Ensign article on resilience that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is only the Atonement that ultimately makes life worth living, only the Atonement of Jesus Christ that can make winter-weary people feel at peace with themselves, happy and optimistic at the outset of another new season<em>.</em><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_03_Archibald.htm#_edn12" target="_self">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Take a moment today as you view the natural world around you. Notice how obedient Heavenly Father's creations are.&nbsp; They fulfill their purpose. Christ used the examples of the lilies of the field, seeds sown in soil and olive trees to teach these doctrines. Let their resilience and ability to grow and renew themselves be an inspiration to you.&nbsp;<strong>Develop your own spiritual resilience through becoming aware of your weaknesses, recognizing your strengths and using them, looking for opportunities, not obstacles, praying for help and guidance from the Lord, exercising your faith in the Lord's promises, and patiently waiting to see the Lord work the miracle of renewal and resilience in your life.</strong><br /><br />I testify that your success in this life is the work and the glory of the Lord. The completion of your mission in this life is the purpose of Christ's atoning sacrifice. Nothing can be more important than your ability to renew your strength in the face of adversity and to mount up with wings of eagles. That we all may fulfill these purposes of the Lord is my prayer.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.<br /><br />In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, it is good to be with you at the beginning of a new semester on another great day at BYU-Idaho. I rejoice at the privilege to speak to you. You are beloved of the Lord.<br /><br />Today, I want to talk about you: about who you are and who you are becoming. The word of the Lord through His living prophets has made it very clear:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is who you really are. This is your eternal nature and identity. Here is your purpose:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the pre-mortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a></sup></p>
<p>You are the spirit sons and daughters of God. You are having a mortal experience to become worthy heirs of exaltation and eternal life with an eternal companion in an eternal family with eternal increase.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering what this has to do with the things you worry about in your daily life--going on a date, passing math, learning to write well, finding a major, or getting a good job.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is my answer: who you really are and who you are becoming eternally have everything to do with the details of your mortal life. In fact, if you come unto Christ, He will shape and develop your eternal identity and character through your choices and actions in every part of your daily life. Through the power of His atoning sacrifice, He will change your heart and help you become more and more like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a process of spiritual growth in which the Lord stretches you and blesses you. Two virtues or qualities of character are at the very heart of this process: hard work and humility. When you act with faith in Christ to humble yourself before Him and do hard work, these two virtues work together to create a powerful, dynamic cycle of spiritual growth. This is the way that you, the beloved spirit sons and daughters of God, gain wonderful, strengthening, earthly experience and progress toward happiness and joy in mortal life and exaltation and eternal life in the world to come. I will speak first about hard work.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Hard Work</strong><br />Hard work is inherent in mortal life. As God said to Adam at the very beginning of mortal life on the earth, "By the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;Developing the capacity to do hard work is an essential part of the Father's plan for His children.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we think of hard work, we often bring to mind something physically demanding. But hard work is not just physical. When I speak of hard work today, I have in mind work that requires sustained application of physical, mental, and spiritual effort with energy, intensity, stamina, and endurance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Think for a moment about the work that had to be done by the people who settled this valley and started this school. In 1870, about 14 years or so before the pioneers arrived here, the U.S. Geological Survey declared this whole area uninhabitable. Yet, those early settlers were undaunted. They had to dig miles and miles of canals with pick and shovel in the dead of winter. They had to find ways to grow food in a hostile desert with a very short growing season. They had to battle mosquitos, illness, wolves, hunger, and discouragement.&nbsp;<br /><br />In their poverty they built a school and nurtured it through years of hardship and depression. They sacrificed and invested in that school, solved difficult problems, and encouraged and inspired generations of young people who came through its doors. The school that started in a log cabin eventually became Ricks College and then BYU-Idaho. The people who settled this valley and laid the foundation for BYU-Idaho had to do hard work that demanded faith, courage, and diligence.&nbsp;<br /><br />You and I encounter hard work in our personal lives, in our families, in our employment, in our schoolwork, and in our service to the Lord. In fact, everything that matters in the Father's plan for us requires hard work. Hard work is a precious gift from the Lord, which He gives us with this command for our mortal journey:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I say unto you that it is my will that you should go forth and not tarry, neither be idle but labor with your might.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Humility</strong><br />I now come to the virtue of humility. The Savior's mortal life was the great example of humility. He was perfectly teachable, perfectly submissive to the will of the Father, and perfectly willing to sacrifice everything He had for His brothers and sisters. Christ-like humility is the opposite of pride and selfishness; but it is not weak or timid. It is not lacking confidence or courage. Think of the Savior cleansing the temple or calling the Pharisees to repentance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Humility opens the mind and the heart to the Spirit and the guidance and strength of the Lord. Humility leads us away from reliance on the arm of flesh and toward trust in the Lord. It fosters kindness, patience, and a willingness to sacrifice, serve, and obey. It is essential to a broken heart and a contrite spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Humility is a virtue that is both developed through what we do and given to us through the mercy and grace of the Savior. As Alma taught Zeezrom:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I wish from the inmost part of my heart . . . that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Alma describes here a process of becoming: we humble ourselves before the Lord so that we might become truly humble through the gifts of the Spirit. Humbling ourselves before the Lord is a pattern for life in which we put Jesus Christ and His kingdom at the center of our lives. We turn to Him and act with faith in Him to repent of our sins, keep His commandments, and humbly seek His mercy and grace in everything we do.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Hard Work and Humbling Ourselves Before the Lord</strong><br />In a life centered on Christ, hard work and humility work together to create a powerful, dynamic cycle of personal spiritual growth. The Lord taught this cycle of spiritual growth to Moroni when Moroni struggled with his writing on the plates. Please turn with me to Ether, chapter 12, verse 27. The first line in that verse says: "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />We all have personal limitations and shortcomings, but the ultimate weakness in all of us is the natural man, the fallen man. The Lord will help us see our personal faults; but more importantly, He will show us the natural man within us. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />How does the Lord show us our weakness? If we come unto Him, the Savior invites us to do the hard work of "[putting] off the natural man and [becoming] a Saint."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;You and I do that in the crucible of mortal life--repenting of sin, coping with illness or death, gaining an education, creating an eternal family, forgiving others, magnifying a calling, and much else. If we do not shrink from that work but act with faith in Him to do it, the Lord will help us see our weakness by stretching us to do these things that are far beyond our native ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord's purpose in stretching us is clear in the second line of the verse: "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Please note the word "may." After we see our weakness, we must choose to humble ourselves before the Lord and seek to put off the natural man with faith in Him. When we do, the Lord gives us this great promise: "my grace is sufficient"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;to "make weak things become strong unto [you]."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;Through the power of His Atonement, the Savior not only helps us do the hard work of putting off the natural man, He helps us become a Saint by changing our very nature, strengthening our character, and blessing us with increased spiritual capacity.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you and I come unto Christ, that stretching and blessing process happens over and over in our lives. It is a recurring cycle of personal spiritual growth, but it is not automatic and it is not mechanical in any way. It happens because of the choices we make and the actions we take all through the stretching and blessing cycle.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, even after we have recognized our weakness and humbled ourselves before the Lord, the way may be hard and the blessings may not come for a time. We may get tired or discouraged. We may feel unappreciated and unrewarded. We may be tempted to cut corners or give up. Thus, all through the stretching phase of the cycle, you and I must decide: will we choose Christ and continue to do the hard work with faith and humility?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If we choose Him and stay the course, the blessings of the Lord will come in His time and in His way. Through His mercy and grace "weak things will become strong unto [us]."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;We will grow in spiritual strength and capacity and become more and more like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, all through the blessing phase of the cycle, we face another choice: will the Lord's blessings of spiritual strength create in us feelings of gratitude and humility or will we attribute the blessings to ourselves and grow in pride and selfishness?&nbsp;<br /><br />If pride and selfishness creep into our hearts, the cycle will stop and even reverse. If the blessings of the Lord lead us to greater gratitude and humility, the cycle of personal spiritual growth will continue.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Applications: Learning, Marriage, and Service to the Lord</strong><br />The principles of hard work and humility and the stretching and blessing process of the Lord have important application in every part of life. I want to illustrate the power this process has in three life experiences that are vital to the Father's plan of happiness and particularly important for you at this time in your lives. The three experiences are learning, marriage, and service in the Lord's kingdom.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Experience #1: Learning<br /></strong><br />Brothers and sisters, learning is hard work. That is especially true for the deep learning that is essential to the Father's plan of salvation. Elder Dallin H. Oaks described deep learning in his talk "The Challenge to Become" this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to know something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become something. . . . To&nbsp;testify&nbsp;is to&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;and to declare. The gospel challenges us to be "converted," which requires us to&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;and to&nbsp;<em>become.</em><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want you to think of learning as an increase in your power to know, to do, and to become. This is deep learning, and it is hard work. Deep learning is not cramming facts and figures into your short-term memory so you can pass a test or doing the minimum amount of work required to get a good grade.&nbsp;<br /><br />Deep learning involves doing the hard work of reading with purpose, taking notes, asking questions, and writing down insights that come. It involves working the problems, practicing and more practicing, learning the techniques, and working to understand the principles and concepts so you can apply them. It is preparing for and actively participating in classes. It is helping others by teaching them what you have learned. It is doing all of this over and over again so that you grow in knowledge and skill.&nbsp;<br /><br />And there is much more. Deep learning is a profoundly spiritual experience. It only comes in its full power through the Holy Ghost, who is the true teacher. Therefore, all your work and study must be done with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and with meaningful prayer, reflection, and pondering. If you humble yourself before the Lord so that His Atonement can work in your life, the Holy Ghost can help you grow in true understanding, change the way you see the world, and change you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes you may feel you are working hard and being stretched but still struggle to learn. I know what that feels like. I remember feeling that way during my freshman year. I was far from home in a school that was very different from anything I had known before. I was scared and a little intimidated. I studied but struggled to learn and do well in school all year long. No young man ever was happier to go on a mission than I was.&nbsp;<br /><br />I loved my mission and learned and grew spiritually during those years. By the time I returned to Harvard I had completed my mission, studied one year at BYU, and married Sue. I enjoyed my year at BYU very much. I learned much better than I had as a freshman, but I still was not confident I could do the work at Harvard. Let me share with you what I discovered.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you ever struggle to learn and get discouraged, please take to heart this counsel: humble yourself before the Lord and then take responsibility for your own learning. Resolve to work harder and to work smarter. Resolve to get help so that you can change the way you work. Don't blame the teacher, or the textbook, or the materials. And please do not feel you cannot learn. When the Atonement of Christ is working in your life, your capacity to learn is unbounded.&nbsp;<br /><br />I give you this promise: if you humble yourself before the Lord, seek His help, and keep working in faith to diligently do what is in your power, He will reach for you and lift you and bless you. I know that is true. You may not get an A in every class, but you will grow in the power to know, to do, and to become.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Experience #2: Marriage</strong><br /><br />"Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;It is central to His plan for His children. God ordained that marriage here in mortality between you and your companion should be an eternal and a holy relationship--founded in sacred ordinances and covenants, sealed forever by God's holy power. It should be a relationship where your love and joy grow, mature, and deepen as the Atonement of Christ works in your life and in your marriage. It should be a relationship in which you and your spouse love each other with all your hearts "and cleave [unto each other] and none else"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;so that your hearts will be "knit together in unity and in love."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>You become an eternal unit; you become one in Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the new and everlasting covenant of marriage. It is an order of the priesthood that confers upon husband and wife, if they are faithful, the greatest blessings the Father gives to His children. Such a marriage and such blessings are amazing and wonderful; but, brothers and sisters, a celestial marriage is something you build. It takes time and effort. For two people to truly become one, there has to be change, sometimes significant change, in habits, attitudes, desires, perspectives, and ways of thinking and feeling. This is truly a mighty change of heart, and it is hard work. Let me give you an example.&nbsp;<br /><br />I grew up in a home where my mother gave me a list of all the household chores I needed to do. One day, not long after we were married, I told Sue that if she would give me a list of chores I would do anything she wanted me to do. I thought this was pretty generous, but she got upset with me! She stamped her foot and said, "I am not giving you a list. This house is just as much your responsibility as it is mine. If you see something needs to be done, just do it."&nbsp;<br /><br />That was a new thought for me. I had to learn a whole new way of thinking about the house. I had to take responsibility for seeing what needed to be done and doing it without a list. I started from that day to try to do that. But it was hard to change old habits and attitudes. I tried, and Sue had to learn to be patient with me. We both learned--with a lot of help from heaven. We had to humble ourselves before the Lord and seek His help. We learned there is a great unifying power in hard work and humility in marriage.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder L. Whitney Clayton taught that power in these words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Humility recognizes that no one can change someone else, but with faith, effort, and the help of God,&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;can undergo&nbsp;<em>our own</em>&nbsp;mighty change of heart.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Experiencing the mighty change of heart causes us to treat others, especially our spouses, with meekness.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Humility means that both husbands and wives seek to bless, help, and lift each other, putting the other first in every decision.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Experience #3: Service to the Lord</strong><br /><br />Opportunities to serve the Lord Jesus Christ are all around you. From the moment you enter the waters of baptism and become members of His true and living Church, and sometimes even earlier, the Lord calls you into His service. He gives you formal callings in His Church. He sends you on personal assignments to love and minister to His children. He blesses you with responsibilities like sharing the gospel, doing family temple work, and being a good neighbor from which you will never be released.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior gives you laws, ordinances, commandments, and the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide your path. He calls you to repentance when you falter. If you turn to Him and away from sin, He blesses you with His redeeming power, He cleanses you, and He strengthens you in your life's journey along the strait and narrow path.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord's love and expectations for you are very high: He wants you to become like Him and enjoy all the blessings the Father has prepared for you. That is why He stretches you with hard work in His service. It is hard work to rescue a lost soul, lead and support a family, or magnify a calling. But this is the Lord's work, and He will bless you as you do it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some people shrink from all this hard work. In fact, there is a widespread point of view in our society that the easy way, the way without hard work, is the best way. Sometimes we hear that idea even in the Lord's Church and even in this university.&nbsp;<br /><br />Not long ago there was a discussion in an elders quorum about home teaching. Recognizing that the level of home teaching effort was far below what the Lord required, the quorum had a good discussion of how they might make substantial progress. Then a young man, a returned missionary, said: "I think the Church is just asking too much. The expectations are so high that no one can meet them. The Church just ends up making us all feel bad because we can't meet these unrealistic expectations."&nbsp;<br /><br />Those sentiments are real, but misguided. Hard work is simply essential to the Lord's plan for you. You are not here to have things easy, nor does the Lord relax His standards and His commandments so you won't feel bad if you don't meet them. His plan is not to lower His standards to your level of ability. His plan is to lift you up with His love and power so that you may put off the natural man and become a Saint. In fact, He wants you to feel godly sorrow and regret when you don't keep your covenants. He wants you to repent and turn to Him for help.&nbsp;<br /><br />If that misguided young man repents and acts with faith in the Savior to get out and do the hard work of home teaching despite the obstacles and problems he faces, the Lord will stretch him. If that young man will humble himself before the Lord, seek His almighty help to lift and strengthen the people he home teaches, the Lord will bless him. If he continues that pattern in every aspect of his life, that young man will become a righteous husband and father and a mighty elder in Israel.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong><br />Brothers and sisters, at the very heart of the interaction between hard work and humility in your lives is the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord stretches you and the Lord blesses you. He is the way to personal spiritual growth, to peace and happiness, and to eternal life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus has made it possible for you to meet every trial, every challenge mortal life gives you. The great Jehovah, the Creator, humbled Himself before His Father and did<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the hardest work of all. Here is His own description of that work:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I; Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_KimClark.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of that marvelous atoning sacrifice, the Savior has all power to lift and strengthen you, to cleanse you from sin, to change your hearts and strengthen you with His power to do hard work. I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. I testify He loves you and desires to use His glorious power to bless you. You have to be diligent, and you have to humble yourselves before Him. But if you act with faith in Him, you can do whatever hard work you face and grow in strength of character and spiritual capacity with His help and with His power. I so testify and leave you with my love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sue Clark was born and raised in Waterflow, New Mexico. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1970 where she majored in child development and family relations.</p>
<p>President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome to a new semester at BYU-Idaho. President Clark and I are so happy that you are here. We love you. We want you to have great success. "May all your dreams come true!"<br /><br />All of us have hopes and dreams. It is a gift from God that we live in a world where we can seek the fulfillment of our dreams. He has given us a promise that we can attain the ultimate of all dreams and inherit all that the Father has!<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_SueClark.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;And He has provided the way. It is a test and a very exciting adventure.&nbsp;<br /><br />If all of our best, wonderful dreams came true just by wishing, without any effort on our part -what bliss!&nbsp; But that is not the plan. The scriptures teach us that Satan proposed such a plan, a plan that would ignore agency, a plan that in truth could not bring us the blessings our Heavenly Father promised.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Heavenly Father's plan is based on the necessity to make choices and to work hard. He loves us and has given us His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, to show us the way. The Lord Jesus Christ loves us with a redeeming love that never fails. He has all power over all things. That is why He said, "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_SueClark.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />During difficult experiences when things are especially hard and dreams seem far beyond our reach, we may begin to doubt His love and His power. My hope for you today is that you will always choose Christ and with faith in Him follow the Father's plan. If you do, you will experience His Love and His power enabling you to embrace the difficult experiences you face without succumbing to fear and doubt.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you face temptation or need to repent, when you have to choose between the words of the prophets and the ways of the world, or when you have to face adversity and don't know what to do, remember the Savior's great promise and His warning:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all holiness of heart . . . with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_SueClark.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Let me share with you an experience from my childhood. I was the third of four girls. My mother thought she would never have a little boy. Finally that little boy came, but he was born without life. As a four-year-old I know I didn't fully comprehend the pain my mother felt, but I had my own pain. I didn't get that new little baby brother to play with. I remember wanting to rectify my pain. I had a cute little cardboard paper doll family. I played with that little family and gave them experiences that were dream-like. One night I took the little baby paper doll from that family, wrapped him in his little blue paper bunting, and laid him on my pillow. As I prepared to go to sleep, I prayed to Heavenly Father that He would make that baby come alive during my sleep that night. Well, you know that dream did not come true.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I understand a little bit better from my own experience as a mother what my mother went through. I look back and admire her for being a woman of great faith. She worked through her grief and her doubts that she could ever have a baby boy. She looked fear in the face when she had thoughts that if she tried again that baby would die too. She didn't listen to the voices of the world telling her she had done enough or to the voice of the adversary telling her it was wrong to have another child.&nbsp; Struggling through all of that, she went forward with faith and prayed that the next baby would be a boy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A loving Heavenly Father answered her prayer and the pain gave way to pure joy with the birth of my brother Malcolm. I was six years old when he was born. I held and played with him often. In fact, my mother went on to have three more baby boys! By the time the youngest brother was born, I was thirteen years old and experienced enough to be even more involved. I remember once even taking a turn in the middle of the night to help my mother get some rest.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I am a mother and a grandmother. I have four very big boys of my own, and also three beautiful daughters and eighteen grandchildren. Attaining this dream I have had to work through difficult experiences of my own, and I am so grateful for a mother who chose the Lord Jesus Christ and passed on that legacy of faith to me. Truly, the dreams of a little four-year-old girl have come true because of the mercy and grace of the Savior whose invitation to us all is: "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_9_17_SueClark.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear brothers and sisters, I pray with all my heart that when you face difficult experiences you will choose the Savior and the Father's plan. Please beware of anything that would draw you away from Christ. Turn away from it and come back quickly to the light of the Lord. I know if you do that your agency will expand. You will have greater capacity to do what is right and good, and God will protect you and bless you forever and ever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 5, 2008. At the time of his call, he was serving in the Presidency of the Seventy.<br /><br />During his tenure in the Presidency of the Seventy, Elder Christofferson had supervisory responsibility for the North America West, Northwest, and Southeast Areas of the Church. He also served as Executive Director of the Family and Church History Department. Earlier, he was president of the Mexico South Area of the Church, resident in Mexico City.<br /><br />Prior to his call to serve as a full-time General Authority of the Church, Elder Christofferson was associate general counsel of NationsBank Corporation (now Bank of America) in Charlotte, North Carolina. Previously, he was senior vice president and general counsel for Commerce Union Bank of Tennessee in Nashville, where he was also active in community affairs and interfaith organizations. From 1975 to 1980, Elder Christofferson practiced law in Washington, D.C., after serving as a law clerk to U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica (1972-74).<br /><br />Born in Pleasant Grove, Utah, on January 24, 1945, he graduated from high school in New Jersey.

<p>As a seventeen-year-old boy, Joseph Smith, Jr. was visited by a glorious angelic minister who declared "that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to [Joseph]."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This angel, Moroni by name, knew Joseph's name, and prophesied "that God had a work for [him] to do; and that [his] name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Today, during this hour, the name of Joseph Smith will be spoken of for good.<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley observed more than once that under the circumstances, Moroni's words were remarkable--to think that this boy growing up in a poor family, in the smallest of small towns, in a country of limited influence and prestige in the world should come to such prominence that his name would be had for good or ill among all nations, kindreds, and people--it was truly (to use an overused word) incredible. Nevertheless, it is a prophecy that has been fulfilled in significant measure and that is more fully realized year by year.&nbsp;<br /><br />This speaks to the centrality of Joseph Smith's prophetic calling in our religion. His role in the Restoration--that is, the prophesied restitution of the Church, priesthood, and gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth--was pivotal, just as with every prophet who ever stood at the head of a gospel dispensation. It is natural that any who oppose The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-- its work, its doctrines, its members--would strike at Joseph Smith. We should not be surprised or alarmed or even defensive. The Lord told the Prophet himself not to be surprised: "The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;However, the Lord added this reassurance: "The pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand. And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We are blessed in our day to have a growing body of information about the Prophet Joseph Smith and his work, but most especially about his teachings. In the Church's study series, "Teachings of the Presidents of the Church," the volume published in 2007 featuring Joseph Smith's teachings and writings is particularly valuable. I hope it is a reference you will always have close at hand in your gospel library. For some years now, the Church History Department has spearheaded a major undertaking to publish all the documents and other materials we can locate that were ever&nbsp;generated by or under the direction of the Prophet. It is known as the Joseph Smith Papers Project. It is anticipated that this project will produce about 24 printed volumes in six series such as Revelations and Translations, Journals, Histories, and so on. To date, seven volumes have been published with two more set to be released this fall. Also, the Internet and electronic publishing have made it possible to access additional early, and even original source material bearing on Joseph Smith's life and times.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our study of the Prophet's life and ministry are more than an intellectual exercise to satisfy curiosity. Insofar as we can, we want to know what he knew; we want to understand what he understood; we want to draw near to God as he did, for as Nicodemus said of the Savior so we can say of Joseph, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Brigham Young expressed it this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The excellency of the glory of the character of Brother Joseph Smith was that he could reduce heavenly things to the understanding of the finite. When he preached to the people--revealed the things of God, the will of God, the plan of salvation, the purposes of Jehovah, the relation in which we stand to him and all the heavenly beings--he reduced his teachings to the capacity of every man, woman and child, making them as plain as a well defined pathway. This should have convinced every person that ever heard him, of his divine authority and power, for no other man was able to teach as he could, and no person can reveal the things of God, but by the revelations of Jesus Christ.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The expanding access we enjoy to the Prophet's work and teachings fills previous voids in our knowledge, confirms some things we already knew or thought, and supplies answers to questions we might have had. The information also raises new questions and highlights new areas of inquiry to pursue. Realistically, however, we ought not to expect in this life to know all the answers (or for that matter, all the questions). The Prophet himself declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You don't know me; you never knew my heart. No man knows my history. I cannot tell it: I shall never undertake it. I don't blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself. . . . When I am called by the trump of the archangel and weighed in the balance, you will know me then.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>You know, of course, that as prophesied by Moroni, there are those whose research relating to Joseph Smith is not for the purpose of gaining added light and knowledge but to undermine his character, magnify his flaws, and if possible destroy his influence. Their work product can sometimes be jarring, and so can issues raised at times by honest historians and researchers with no "axe to grind." But I would offer you this advice in your own study: Be patient, don't be superficial, and don't ignore the Spirit.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Be Patient.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In counseling patience, I simply mean that while some answers come quickly or with little effort, others are simply not available for the moment because information or evidence is lacking. Don't suppose, however, that a lack of evidence about something today means that evidence doesn't exist or that it will not be forthcoming in the future. The absence of evidence is not proof. Here's one small example:&nbsp;<br /><br />Matthew Roper in a FairMormon Blog on June 17, 2013, writes about a criticism repeated many times over the years about the mention of steel in the Book of Mormon. In 1884, one critic wrote, "Laban's sword was steel, when it is a notorious fact that the Israelites knew nothing of steel for hundreds of years afterwards. Who but as ignorant a person as Rigdon would have perpetuated all these blunders."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;More recently, Thomas O'Dea in 1957 stated, "Every commentator on the Book of Mormon has pointed out the many cultural and historical anachronisms, such as the steel sword of Laban in 600 B.C."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We had no answer to these critics at the time, but as often happens in these matters, new discoveries in later years shed new light. Roper reports, "It is increasingly apparent that the practice of hardening iron through deliberate carburization, quenching and tempering was well known to the ancient world from which Nephi came. 'It seems evident,' notes one recent authority, 'that by the beginning of the tenth century B.C. blacksmiths were intentionally steeling iron.'"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;In 1987, the Ensign reported that archeologists had unearthed a long steel sword near Jericho dating back to the late seventh century B.C., probably to the reign of King Josiah who died shortly before Lehi began to prophesy.<sup>11</sup>This sword is now on display at Jerusalem's Israel Museum. The museum's explanatory sign reads in part, "The sword is made of iron hardened into steel, attesting to substantial metallurgical know-how."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Where answers are incomplete or lacking altogether, patient study and patient waiting for new information and discoveries to unfold will often be rewarded with understanding.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Don't Be Superficial.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />When I say don't be superficial, I mean don't form conclusions based on unexamined assertions or incomplete research, and don't be influenced by insincere seekers. I would offer you the advice of our Assistant Church Historian, Rick Turley, an intellectually gifted researcher and author whose recent works include the definitive history of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. He says simply, "Don't study Church history too little."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;While some honestly pursue truth and real understanding, others are intent on finding or creating doubts. Their interpretations may come from projecting 21st Century concepts and culture backward onto 19th Century people. If there are differing interpretations possible, they will pick the most negative. They sometimes accuse the<br /><br />Church of hiding something because they only recently found or heard about it--an interesting accusation for a Church that's publishing 24 volumes of all it can find of Joseph Smith's papers. They may share their assumptions and speculations with some glee, but either can't or won't search further to find contradictory information.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Remember the verse of English poet Alexander Pope:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A little learning is a dangerous thing;<br />Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:<br />There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,<br />And drinking largely sobers us again.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>We should be careful not to claim for Joseph Smith perfections he did not claim for himself. He need not have been superhuman to be the instrument in God's hands that we know him to be. In May, 1844, Joseph declared: "I never told you I was perfect, but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He had commented earlier: "Although I do wrong, I do not the wrongs I am charged with doing: the wrong that I do is through the frailty of human nature, like other men. No man lives without fault. Do you think that even Jesus, if He were here, would be without fault in your eyes? His enemies said all manner of evil against Him--they all watched for iniquity in Him."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Joseph Smith was a mortal man striving to fulfill an overwhelming, divinely- appointed mission against all odds. The wonder is not that he ever displayed human failings, but that he succeeded in his mission. His fruits are undeniable and undeniably good.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Don't Ignore the Spirit.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, don't neglect the Spirit. As regards Joseph Smith, we seek learning both by study and by faith.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Both are fruitful paths of inquiry. A complete understanding can never be attained by scholarly research alone, especially since much of what is needed is either lost or never existed. There is no benefit in imposing artificial limits on ourselves that cut off the light of Christ and the revelations of the Holy Spirit. Remember, "By the power of the Holy Ghost, ye may know the truth of all things."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of you may remember hearing about a man named Mark Hofmann, now serving a prison sentence in Utah for murder. He was an expert forger of historical documents. Some of these were tied to U.S. history, but several related to Church history. One was a purported letter from Martin Harris to W. W. Phelps reporting that Joseph Smith found the gold plates led by a spirit who "transfigured himself from a white salamander in the bottom of the hole" where the plates were. Another was a supposed transcript of a blessing given by the Prophet to his son Joseph Smith III in 1844 declaring his son to be his rightful successor as head of the Church.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some left the Church when these documents were publicized saying it was clear that Joseph Smith's testimony concerning his visions was false or that they could no longer consider The Church&nbsp;of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the true Church. Not long afterward these and other documents were shown to be forgeries. I wondered, do those who were so troubled believe again now, and when other questions arise, as they always do, will they leave again? In matters of faith, a spiritual witness is essential if one is to avoid being "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;With a Spirit-derived assurance in place, you can go forward in the Lord's work and continue deepening your relationship with your Heavenly Father while pursuing or awaiting answers. If you determine to sit still, paralyzed until every question is answered and every whisper of doubt resolved, you will never move because in this life there will always be some issue pending or something yet unexplained.&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith's prophetic calling is key to our religion. Without his commission from the Father and the Son, without his priesthood ordinations and the keys he received at the hands of duly appointed heavenly messengers, without the fullness of the gospel restored through his visions and revelations and his translations of the Book of Mormon and the Bible, what we would have is something much less than true Christianity. It is critical that we gain a witness of these things by study and above all, by the teaching of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite all this, however, I remind you that Joseph Smith is not our foundation--it is Jesus Christ and Him crucified and resurrected. Joseph Smith, Jr. was called of God "to be a translator, a revelator, a seer, and a prophet."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Each of these titles has particular significance, but there is no more important aspect of his prophetic mission than his revelation of Jesus Christ in our time. Every element of God's plan for the salvation of His children in time and eternity hinges on Jesus Christ and faith in Him, and since there is no salvation without Jesus, it is critical that He be revealed to mankind in His true character. This becomes increasingly important as the biblical testimony of Jesus recedes in time and more and more begin to doubt, including even some professors and ministers of religion.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Prophet Joseph Smith is the great latter-day revelator of Jesus Christ in at least three important ways: first, he is a personal witness of the fact of the Savior's resurrection, second, he is the translator and publisher of the most forceful and complete written testament of Jesus Christ in existence, and third, he presents to the world a testimony of Christ irrefutably sealed with his own blood.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>His personal witness of the Savior's resurrection.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />It is now and always has been the role of His apostles and prophets to bear a sure witness of the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ. When the ancient apostles met to select a successor to Judas Iscariot in their quorum, Peter stated, "Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, . . . must one be ordained to be a witness&nbsp;with us of his resurrection."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;His resurrection confirms the divinity of the Savior and the reality of His Atonement and its power to redeem us from death and sin. If the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a literal fact, all that is said and written about him as being nothing more than a gifted and charismatic mortal is so much hot air and wasted paper; the arguments of atheists and humanists become meaningless; the search for purpose and meaning in life is at an end. The resurrection of Christ changes everything.&nbsp;<br /><br />At age 14, in response to sincere and fervent prayer, Joseph Smith was visited by the Savior and God the Father. He saw the Father motion toward Jesus, and heard him say, Joseph, "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Joseph spoke to the Lord, and the Lord spoke to him. He knew firsthand that Jesus is the Son, the Beloved Son of God, and that as a resurrected being, He lives. Of his experience, Joseph Smith wrote, "I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some 16 years later, in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, Joseph recorded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Joseph Smith's testimony of these and other visitations, we find the clearest possible revelation of the resurrected Lord.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>His translation and publication of the Book of Mormon.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ, is the single most complete and compelling volume of scripture known to the world that attests to the divinity of Jesus Christ and the plan of redemption that centers in Him. It was compiled for the purpose of convincing all, both Jew and Gentile, "that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;It confirms and upholds the eloquent witness of both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. In translating and publishing the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith has made its testimony his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon's witness of Christ is found throughout the book. Among the most moving declarations are those connected with the Lord's personal ministry among the Book of Mormon peoples following His resurrection. After the Father's voice from heaven introduced Jesus as "my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name,"<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;the Savior, standing in their midst, said to the people:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning. . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.<sup>29</sup></p>
<p>My own witness of Jesus Christ was born in the pages of the Book of Mormon. It was the first and foundational evidence leading to my testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Continued study of that book continues to deepen my conversion.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sealing his testimony with his own blood.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Martyrdom endows a prophet's testimony with a special validity. Indeed the Greek root "martureo" from which the English word "martyr" is derived means "witness." The prophet Abinadi is described as "having sealed the truth of his words by his death."<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Jesus' own death was a testament of His divinity and mission. He is declared in Hebrews to be "the mediator of the new testament" validated by His death, "For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead."<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"Like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient time, [Joseph Smith] sealed his mission and his works with his own blood."<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;In a hail of bullets on the afternoon of June 27, 1844, in Carthage, Illinois, Joseph and his brother, Hyrum, were cut down for the religion and testimony they professed. As the latter-day apostles then announced, "The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force. . . . Their innocent blood on the banner of liberty, and on the magna charta of the United States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men among all nations."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith's revelation of Christ, sealed by his blood and supported by the testimony of his fellow martyr Hyrum, is now binding upon the world. The most eloquent expression of that testimony was given in 1832 as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all which we give of him: That he lives!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>Among mortals, the Lord Jesus Christ has had no surer witness, no more committed disciple, no more loyal advocate than Joseph Smith, His prophet, seer, and revelator. By his personal witness of the resurrected Savior, by his translation and publication of the Book of Mormon, and by his martyrdom, Joseph Smith has laid before the world the preeminent revelation of Jesus Christ for our time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear witness of Joseph Smith's prophetic calling, and to his magnificent revelation of Jesus, I reverently add my own testimony of the Christ. I too know that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. He stands at the head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is the Redeemer, and His grace is sufficient.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;I pray that all may receive the testimony of Joseph Smith and come unto Christ, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

With today's greater access to original sources, including the Palmyra Register newspaper, there is ample evidence of religious revivals in the area during 1820 and some years prior. It appears that the Methodists had a regularly used camp meeting ground, and that revivals were common enough that often they garnered no coverage in the newspapers unless something out of the ordinary occurred such as a death. (See "Joseph Smith's First Vision/Religious revivals in 1820," http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith's_First_Vision/Religious_revivals_in_1820 accessed on 17 September 2013; See also Milton V. Backman, Jr., "Awakenings in the Burned-over District: New Light on the Historical Setting of the First Vision," BYU Studies 9, no. 3 (Spring 1969): 301-320).<br /><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Commenting on this counsel, former Church Historian Elder Marlin K. Jensen added: "There is much wisdom in that. There is great danger, I think, in picking out just one piece of [the] puzzle and looking at it in isolation. When we enjoy a perfect knowledge of Church history, many of the things that are jarring won't be jarring at all" (Marlin K. Jensen, When It Is All Over, Clark Memorandum, Spring, 2013, 44).<br /><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Recording mistakes, for example, have sometimes been seized on as evidence of misrepresentations or bumbling by the Prophet. For example, the Book of Commandments initially referred to Joseph Smith as "an elder" and Oliver Cowdery the same, rather than "First Elder" and "Second Elder" as found in the text of Doctrine and Covenants Section 20. The 1833 Book of Commandments suggested that the Church was organized in Manchester rather than Fayette, New York. The June 1839 Manuscript History of the Church says it was Nephi who appeared to Joseph Smith in 1823 rather than Moroni. Now, however, with original manuscripts contained in the Book of Commandments and Revelations, published as part of the Joseph Smith Papers Project, and other early sources we can "peel back the onion" a little further. And we find that the supposed problems are nothing more sinister than clerical errors sometimes repeated by others.<br /><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Alexander Pope, Essay on Criticism, Part II, Line 1; cited in John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations, Little, Brown and Co., 1955, 310.<br /><sup>16</sup>&nbsp;History of the Church 6:366; cited in Teachings of the Presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith, 2007, 522.<br /><sup>17</sup>&nbsp;History of the Church 5:140; cited in Teachings of the Presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith, 2007, 522.<br /><sup>18</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 88:118.<br /><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Moroni 10:5.

<p>Good afternoon brothers and sisters.<br /><br />I am humbled, astonished, but grateful for this opportunity to speak to you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I have prayed and continue to pray that the Spirit will attend us today as we review and learn together. I hope you will have a prayer in your heart for me also that I may convey the message I have prepared.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am overwhelmed that you have come today. You are truly a great sight. Your presence brings hope for the future. I know of your goodness and potential and believe in your exceptional ability to do what is right. I know this because you are here on earth at this time and here at BYU-Idaho learning and preparing for your future.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I contemplated what I might say today, what topic would have meaning for you, at the beginning of this semester and for many of you the beginning of your college experience, my mind came across a saying my parents have framed and displayed in the front entry of their home, "If it is to be, it is up to me." I would like to focus today on the idea of choices and decision making, your agency.&nbsp;<br /><br />What you become will be a product of your effort, study, and prayer. You have the potential to become anything you desire.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I would like to begin by going back, back to our pre-mortal life for a moment.&nbsp;<br /><br />In our pre-mortal existence we lived in a beautiful home blessed with the eternal love of our Heavenly parents. There we progressed, learning and growing, gaining knowledge until our Heavenly Father knew it was time for us to gain other experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A council was held and our Father presented a plan wherein we would have the chance to gain physical bodies like our Heavenly parents and to prove ourselves that we would follow His commandments in mortality. This plan involved a continuation of our agency which would bring risk, and hardship in mortality, but also joy and fulfillment. At the center of Heavenly Father's plan was a Savoir who would be willing to atone for our sins if we would repent and follow Him, thus allowing us the opportunity to return to the presence of our Heavenly Parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />At this council an alternate plan was also presented by one of our brothers, Lucifer, wherein he would guarantee our safe arrival back home, and because he would do this he wanted the honor and power for himself.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord speaking to Moses said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng" target="_self">&nbsp;</a>down;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>We all made a choice, to either follow our Heavenly Father's plan or to follow Lucifer and his plan. It must have been a difficult choice as one third of our brothers and sister chose to follow Lucifer. But because he rebelled and desired to destroy our agency he was cast down with his followers and became Satan or the devil.&nbsp;<br /><br />You made the choice to follow our Heavenly Father's plan and you must have been valiant in that struggle. You have been saved to be on earth at this time to prepare the world for the second coming of the Savior. Your ability to choose correctly is manifest by your presence here today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan is a real being who has many followers. He and his followers are still seeking to destroy God's plan for his children. He is waging a war for the souls of men. We see his work and success all around us. The world is embracing much of Satan's ways. Good is called evil and evil good, the family is being attacked on almost every front. Morality, honor, and virtue are disregarded as old fashioned, out of touch and unrealistic. It is easy to get ourselves entangled and wounded with sin and transgression, if we fail to make correct decisions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Agency was and is essential to God's plan for us. With agency, we are given a chance to choose for ourselves the path of obedience to God's commandments or to follow the ways of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />In one of our sacred hymns we learn:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Know this, that every soul is free to choose his life and what he'll be, for this eternal truth is given; that God will force no man to heaven. He'll call, persuade, direct aright, and bless with wisdom, love and light, in nameless ways be good and kind, but never force the human mind.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Lehi, teaching his sons near the end of his mortal experience, taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>It really is a choice between good and evil, God or Satan.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Heavenly Father is the God of the universe. If we have faith in this truth and faith in his plan which provided a Savior for us in Jesus Christ the Son of God, we can stay on the straight and narrow path our Father has outlined for us.&nbsp; We must be meek, humble, and submissive to Him, being willing to obey all that He commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that our Heavenly Father is God, that he is over all, He knows the beginning and the end, He is omniscient and his love is eternal and his blessings glorious.&nbsp;<br /><br />For us to become like our Father in Heaven we must have experience with making decisions. We knew we needed to have earthly physical experiences to further our education. Through our Heavenly Father's glorious plan we have been given the opportunity to grow and progress with unlimited potential to become like He is. The choice is yours, not your parents, nor your roommates, nor your teachers, not even your friends, it is yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If it is to be, it is up to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />With choices and decisions comes consequences. We are free to choose our way but we are not free to choose the consequence of our choice.&nbsp;<br /><br />President James E. Faust, a member of the First Presidency in a 2004 April conference address stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this life we have to make many choices. Some are very important choices. Some are not. Many of our choices are between good and evil. The choices we make, however, determine to a large extent our happiness or our unhappiness, because we have to live with the consequences of our choices. Making perfect choices all of the time is not possible. It just doesn't happen. But it is possible to make good choices we can live with and grow from. When God's children live worthy of divine guidance they can become 'free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon'.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Your God given agency is essential to your learning and growth here upon this earth. You are constantly faced with choices and decisions in all aspects of your life. How and what you choose will determine your satisfaction or dissatisfaction in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we leave our decision to the very moment, we may be very sorry with the consequence of what we choose.&nbsp;<br /><br />Life comes quickly and if we are not prepared or are listening to the wrong source we may be disappointed at the consequence of our choice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share an example from my own experience that illustrates how quickly a decision can come upon us.&nbsp;<br /><br />A long time ago, when I was your age, just after my mission, a cousin and I were in the northern desert of Utah. We were driving on a very lonely dirt road, miles and miles from any pavement or farms. As we rounded a corner, at a speed much faster than we should have been going, in my little 1971 VW bug, a large mud hole presented a quick decision - turn hard to the right or left and miss the mud or plow straight through. We only had a second to decide.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was one of those beautiful spring days, clear skies, warm, our windows down. We had been having a great time together that day and the daylight was beginning to run out. I was at the wheel and had to make that crucial decision - go straight through or turn that little bug hard. In that split second as the choice was before me I had the feeling - just go straight through that mud. Besides, I thought, what can happen? The mud is only 10 yards long, I can make it at this speed. I didn't make it, made it only about half way and was up to the floorboards in mud and water. We spent many hours, until well after dark getting the bug out of that mud. We ourselves became covered with mud in our efforts.&nbsp;<br /><br />A quick decision turned into a long tedious effort to free ourselves from the effects or consequence of that choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But, let's back up. What led me to that decision? My speed, which was too fast, the sharpness of the corner which made it impossible to see around that corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What if - I had made an earlier decision to slow down for the corner, as I should have? Would my experience have been different? Yes, I could have avoided the mud hole altogether and our day would have continued, full of fun, no worries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After looking back on that decision, even though we ended up in the middle of the mud, I am grateful for the thought or the impression to go straight through. If I would have made the choice to turn that VW bug hard to the right or left, at the speed we were going, I most likely would have rolled it and the outcome would have been very different and the consequence could have been life changing for me and my cousin.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were out there on our own, physically, but spiritually we had the help of a still small voice or feeling.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the booklet For the Strength of Youth, the First Presidency states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The standards in this booklet will help you with the important choices you are making now and will yet make in the future. We promise that as you keep the covenants you have made and these standards, you will be blessed with the companionship of the Holy Ghost, your faith and testimony will grow stronger, and you will enjoy increasing happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The decisions you make now will set the course for much of what will follow during your mortal life and throughout eternity.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>I encourage you to keep your copy of "For the Strength of Youth" close to you.&nbsp; Read it often and commit to live by its counsel. Do not wait for a situation or decision to come and catch you off guard. Be ready, having thought through your choices in advance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Making good decisions each day and keeping the commitments we have made will leads us on to making other good and righteous decisions. As we continue on this path our hearts are turned to the Lord and his ways. Our pathway is then lit by truth that leads us on to knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The choices you make each day from small and simple to large and complicated will have lasting, even eternal consequences. The path our life takes is not determined by great and grand decisions but rather by the little day-to-day choices we make.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Quentin L. Cook in a 2011 April conference address retold the following story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I was recently assigned to a conference in the Mission Viejo California Stake, I was touched by an account of their four-stake New Year's Eve youth dance. Following the dance, a purse was found with no outside identification. I share with you part of what Sister Monica Sedgwick, the Young Women president in the Laguna Niguel stake, recorded: "We didn't want to pry; this was someone's personal stuff! So we gingerly opened it and grabbed the first thing that was on top--hopefully, it would identify her. It did, but in another way--it was a&nbsp;<em>For the Strength of Youth</em>&nbsp;pamphlet. Wow! This told us something about her. Then we reached in for the next item, a little notebook. Surely this would give us answers, but not the kind we were expecting. The first page was a list of favorite scriptures. There were five more pages of carefully written scriptures and personal notes."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The sisters immediately wanted to meet this stalwart young woman. They returned to that purse to identify its owner. They pulled out some breath mints, soap, lotion, and a brush. I loved their comments: "Oh, good things come out of her mouth; she has clean and soft hands; and she takes care of herself."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They eagerly awaited the next treasure. Out came a clever little homemade coin purse made from a cardboard juice carton, and there was some money in a zippered pocket. They exclaimed, "Ahh, she's creative and prepared!" They felt like little children on Christmas morning. What they pulled out next surprised them even more: a recipe for Black Forest chocolate cake and a note to make the cake for a friend's birthday. They almost screamed, "She's a HOMEMAKER! Thoughtful and service minded." Then, yes, finally some identification. The youth leaders said they felt greatly blessed "to observe the quiet example of a young lady living the gospel."<strong><sup>6</sup></strong></p>
<p>What did the content of this young woman's purse reveal about her?&nbsp; Did it show a pattern of decisions she had made?&nbsp; Did it show where her heart and mind were?&nbsp; Could you determine which direction she was moving?&nbsp;<br /><br />This story illustrates that each of us can live in the world and not be of the world. What we hold dear in our private lives, when no one is looking, is who we are. Each small decision leads us in a direction. Which direction are you moving? Can you see the Savior in front of you or do you need to turn your head to see Him?&nbsp;<br /><br />What if someone was to look into your purse or wallet, your closet or dresser, or your inner thoughts or your computer files, what would they determine about you? If you are thinking right now, I hope this never happens to me, it may be time to change the way you make decisions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your college years can and will be wonderful, and exciting, also terrifying, and difficult, and we hope rewarding and satisfying. Decisions will have to be made. How do you find answers, how do you make correct decisions?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President James E. Faust, in the same April 2004 Conference address taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A choice involves making a conscious decision. To make an intelligent decision we need to evaluate all available facts on both sides of an issue. But that isn't enough. Making correct decisions involves prayer and inspiration. The 9th section of the&nbsp;<a href="http://lds.org/study/topics/doctrine-and-covenants?lang=eng" target="_self">Doctrine and Covenants</a>&nbsp;gives us the grand key. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>This implies that making decisions is work. It takes thought, study, conclusion and then confirmation. To receive the confirmation we are looking for we will need to be worthy to receive inspiration from the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of you have made a commitment to live by the honor code of this University. Most of you have also made a covenant with God to keep his commandments, remember His Son Jesus Christ and to take upon you the name of Christ. As you keep your commitments and covenants you will be blessed with a deeper understanding of the gospel and your place in the Kingdom of God. You will continue to grow in truth, light and knowledge.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through your own individual efforts to learn truth you are blessed with additional light, which if followed will lead you on to knowledge, "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were and as they are to come".<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We know the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in unholy tabernacles, so for us to keep the Spirit with us to help us in our efforts to make correct decisions we need to live according to the Spirit. We need to keep the covenants and commitments we have made.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you were baptized and confirmed a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints a priesthood holder holding the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood laid his hands on your head and asked you to "receive the Holy Ghost." It is up to you to receive the Holy Ghost in your life, to live a life so that you are worthy to receive of His guidance and protection.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1991, 22 years ago, before some of you were born, Elder Boyd K. Packer taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No one of us can survive in the world of today, much less in what it soon will become, without personal inspiration.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Well, we are living in that world and we see what it is becoming.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales in a 2007 April conference address speaking to the YM of the church and this applies equally as well to the YW and in fact to all of us, taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...it is important that you prepare now. You must develop your own preconditioned responses for the important decisions you will make in the next decade of your life. You must know what to do and when to do it when each decision presents itself. Remember that making no decision at all could be just as deadly as making the wrong decision. Many of the decisions you make or don't make will have eternal consequences.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Be faithful to your covenants and commitments and the Lord will bless you with insight and inspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember the Lord said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In your quest to make decisions that will bring you closer to your Heavenly Father and His Son, I would encourage you to become a true disciple of Jesus Christ. Live so that God and others will know whose side you are on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Each student, faculty and staff at BYU-Idaho have committed to an honor code. If we all keep our commitment the Holy Spirit will guide us in our daily decisions. We will find peace in our trials and comfort to our souls.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Honor Code is simple and easy to remember, most of us memorized it early in life without knowing it. I remember, when I was 11 years old, running across a hay field in the back of my home to my primary teacher's home to pass off the Thirteenth Article of Faith, which is the basis for the BYU-Idaho Honor Code. After forgetting some of it and running back home to work on it some more, I finally ran back and remembered the whole thing as I passed it off to Brother Purcell as he was working on his farm equipment in his farm yard.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in doing good to all men, indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul - we believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things.&nbsp; If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>If you have forgotten this from your primary days, please relearn it and commit to live by it.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you are faithful in keeping your commitments to live by the Honor Code the Lord will bless you with the guidance of His Holy Spirit. You will be guided in the decisions you will need to make as you progress here at BYU-Idaho and throughout your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />To help you in making correct decisions and to be worthy of the Holy Spirit's guidance may I suggest a pattern, a set of steps to follow:</p>
<p>Study your choices or the matter out in your mind.<br />Read, ponder and meditate on the Scriptures and the teachings of the Latter-day Prophets.<br />Pray to the Lord in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you will receive.<br />Be obedient to the commitments and covenants you have made.<br />Be humble and meek, focusing on things of God rather that the things of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of you have been blessed with intelligence and light. Continue to walk in the light and you will be blessed with additional light and truth. "And by the power of the Holy Ghost you shall know the truth of all things."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />This weekend we will be blessed to hear from our prophet and apostles in general conference. Please pay close attention to their messages. You will find answers to your worries and questions if you will do so.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that God is over all and knows all. Allow his Holy Spirit to guide you by strict obedience to his commandments. Keep the covenants you have made with your Father in Heaven and the commitment you have made to abide by the BYU-Idaho Honor Code and you will be blessed with inspiration and guidance in your daily decision making. Use your agency wisely.If it is to be, it is up to me.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>I greet you today in the spirit of love. I greet you as one who loves learning and particularly as one who loves the learning associated with institutions of higher education. I have a great love for President and Sister Clark and for those who serve with them in administering the affairs of this marvelous and unique university. I love you faculty members who have given your lives to the profession of teaching and learning and also those of you many staff members who provide the multitude of services that make teaching and learning possible here at Brigham Young University Idaho. And, quite particularly, I love you students. It was my love for students like you fifty years ago that led to my decision to pursue a career in higher education administration. You are the reason this institution exists. You are the reason your leaders lead, your teachers teach, and the service staff serves. I love this institution, but most of all, I love with all my heart a graduate of this institution. I am strengthened today, as always, by the presence of my wife, Janeil, who graduated from Ricks College, shall we say, just a few years ago. We are honored to be in your presence today.&nbsp;<br /><br />I began my remarks greeting you as one who loves learning. I do love learning--the learning of both temporal and spiritual truths. I invite you to think with me today about a topic I have chosen to call: "The Divine Law of Learning." The Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And as all have not&nbsp;faith, seek ye diligently and&nbsp;teach&nbsp;one another words of&nbsp;wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best&nbsp;books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>You could not ask for a better environment to be taught and to seek learning by both study and faith than you have here at BYU Idaho. Do all you can to develop your skills and your personal discipline to learn by study; and study harder, longer, and in more depth than you have ever studied before in your life. However, do not miss the great opportunity you have to develop and learn through your faith as well. Increase and exercise your faith; and the Spirit will teach you as you study, as you pray, as you ponder, as you sit in class, and even as you sleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope each of you loves learning and that you will not only learn by study and by faith but by every experience you have in life. If you do not feel a sense of urgency--an excitement and love for learning now, strive for it, work at it, and never give up on it, until you feel it in every fiber of your being. Think of learning as one of the very most important endeavors of your life.<strong></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brigham Young gave us an enlightened perspective on the eternal nature of learning when he said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I shall not cease learning while I live, nor when I arrive in the spirit world; but shall there learn with greater facility; and when I again receive my body, I shall learn a thousand times more in a thousand times less time; and then I do not mean to cease learning, but shall still continue my researches.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Learning is one of the most basic laws of God. This was made very clear when the Lord said: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake the evil one."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; This would surely suggest that learning is of very high priority with our Heavenly Father. We read in the Doctrine and Covenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Learning was also a part of our pre-mortal existence. We made choices there based on what we had come to know--on what we had learned. And, at the very beginning of time, as we know it, the Lord taught Adam and Eve basic principles of life and salvation and then said: "Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>. It was imperative that Adam and Eve's children learn what Adam and Eve had learned. And so the pattern continues and will continue through time and eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider a few additional scriptural references. We read in the Proverbs of King Solomon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A wise&nbsp;man&nbsp;will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>And "Wisdom&nbsp;is&nbsp;the principal thing;&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;And the Savior said: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn&nbsp;of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find&nbsp;rest&nbsp;unto your souls."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;He also said: "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church . . .<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn10" target="_self">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Further, the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And I give unto you a commandment that you shall&nbsp;teach&nbsp;one another the&nbsp;doctrine&nbsp;of the kingdom. Teach ye diligently and my&nbsp;grace&nbsp;shall attend you, that you may be&nbsp;instructed&nbsp;more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Get all the education you can . . . Cultivate skills of mind and hands. Education is the key to opportunity. The Lord has placed upon you, as members of this Church, the obligation to study and to learn of things spiritual, yes, but of things temporal also. Acquire all of the education that you can, even if it means great sacrifice while you are young. You will bless the lives of your children. You will bless the Church because you will reflect honor to this work.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn12" target="_self">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Some of you may be here because of what you have read regarding education in the "For the Strength of Youth" pamphlet. Let me quote just a few lines:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Education is an important part of Heavenly Father's plan to help you become more like Him. He wants you to educate your mind and to develop your skills and talents, your power to act well in your responsibilities, and your capacity to appreciate life. The education you gain will be valuable to you during mortality and in the life to come. Education will prepare you for greater service in the world and in the Church. It will help you better provide for yourself, your family, and those in need.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>That learning is important cannot be questioned, but I offer now a cautionary note of scriptural origin. The words will be familiar to you. They are found in 2 Nephi chapter 9 where Jacob, brother of Nephi, teaches marvelous truths pertaining to the Father's Plan and the Atonement of Jesus Christ and then gives this crucial counsel and caution:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O that cunning&nbsp;plan&nbsp;of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the&nbsp;foolishness&nbsp;of men! When they are learned they think they are&nbsp;wise, and they&nbsp;hearken not&nbsp;unto the&nbsp;counsel&nbsp;of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.&nbsp;<em>But to be&nbsp;learned&nbsp;is good if they&nbsp;hearken&nbsp;unto the&nbsp;counsels&nbsp;of God</em>.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn14" target="_self">14</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>I draw your attention--eyes, ears, mind, and heart--to both parts of that last sentence. "But to be&nbsp;learned&nbsp;is good, if they&nbsp;hearken&nbsp;unto the&nbsp;counsels&nbsp;of God."&nbsp;<br /><br />To be learned&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good, but we cannot ignore that huge and all-important qualifying "if" that follows--if they (meaning you and me) hearken unto the counsels of God. Do you see the relationship here to learning by study and by faith? We can become learned by study. But if we have not hearkened unto the counsels of God, our faith is either vain or entirely absent. If such were to be the case, all of our "getting" as referred to by King Solomon would be limited to knowledge alone, with neither wisdom nor understanding being acquired.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nephi taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line,&nbsp;precept&nbsp;upon precept, here a little and there a little; and&nbsp;<em>blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom</em>; for unto him that&nbsp;receiveth&nbsp;I will give&nbsp;more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p>So what are the counsels of God to which we must hearken for learning to be good? We could cite many references, but the Lord's counsel to the Prophet Joseph will do for now. He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p>What then are the counsels of God?&nbsp; To study, pray, believe, be obedient, keep our covenants, walk uprightly, and live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost!&nbsp;<br /><br />The university will be your partner by providing an environment conducive to learning--an environment that should inspire you with an excitement and desire to continue learning throughout your life. The faculty and others will assist you. They will facilitate your learning and equip you with information, skills, and learning resources; but you must take responsibility for your own learning. It is to be anticipated that each of you will complete the work that you have begun--that you will qualify for the degree or certificate that you have chosen or will yet choose to pursue. That degree or certificate, however, should not be the end objective of your pursuit, just as a good grade should not be the ultimate objective of a particular course. Even learning itself must not be your ultimate objective. It is not learning for learning's sake that matters. It is what your learning produces. What you become as a person will be the ultimate measure of your learning success.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The ultimate goal of an education is to make us better parents and servants in the kingdom. In the long run it is the growth, knowledge, and wisdom we achieve that enlarges our souls and prepares us for eternity . . . Education is a gift from God; it is a cornerstone of our religion when we use it to benefit others. Learning with the Spirit is not confined to classrooms or preparation for school examinations. It applies to everything we do in life and every place we do it--at home, at work, and at church. An education is not limited to formal study. Lifelong learning can increase our ability to appreciate and relish the workings and beauty of the world around us.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, let's think more deeply about what I referred to earlier as "The Divine Law of Learning" remembering that it is not what we know that matters, but what we become. The object of learning is not knowledge alone, but the wisdom to make positive personal change in our lives--each of us using what we have come to know to become, step by step, the kind of person Our Heavenly Father would want us to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />Think about learning, what it means, and its progressive levels of development. Again, the Lord made it clear that the glory of God is intelligence. Intelligence is more than being smart--more than having a high IQ. Let us think of intelligence at the highest levels of learning and being divinely and directly associated with the "Glory of God."&nbsp; The first step in "The Divine Law of Learning" is "Knowledge." If our learning, however, results only in the acquisition of knowledge, we have fallen short.&nbsp; Knowledge merely answers the question: "What is it?" Our learning must progress beyond knowledge to "Understanding." We must come to understand that which we have come to know.&nbsp; Understanding answers the question: "What does it mean?" Once we have come to understand thoroughly the meaning of the knowledge we have acquired, our learning must then progress to "Belief." To come to believe that which we have come to understand brings our learning to a more personal level as it answers the question: "What does it mean to me?"&nbsp;<br /><br />I must interject a qualifying comment here. During the course of your life and learning you will be exposed to ideas and theories that may be presented and promoted as established truth. Some of these ideas and theories will be important for you to know and to understand, but you will wisely consider them only as interesting--even intriguing--information, knowing that they have not been established as either temporal or spiritual truth; and they will mean little or nothing to you in terms of what you come to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, once we have come to know, understand, and believe new truths, our beliefs then become meaningful only as we take the necessary "Action" to apply in our daily lives what we have come to believe. This then, of course, answers the question: "What am I going to do because of it?" Or, in other words: "What am I going to do about what I have come to know, understand, and believe?"&nbsp; This action should then produce in us the "Wisdom" to make positive personal change in our lives, answering the question: "What have I become because of it?" Do you see how knowledge must progress to understanding, then to belief and action, progressing to the wisdom necessary to make positive personal change in our lives?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, some of you are thinking that not everything that you come to know, understand, and believe has application to your life and that there is nothing about that particular body of knowledge that would or should produce any change in your life. It may be some mathematical concept, a chemical equation, or some abstract thought. You may be right; it may not have practical application to your life; but no matter what you study, move what you learn as far up in "The Divine Law of Learning" as you possibly can, never being satisfied with merely acquiring knowledge. You can pass an exam with knowledge. That is not enough! No matter what the subject, your objective should never be a course taken and grade received--never to be bothered with that subject again.&nbsp;<br /><br />We learn much from King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon. After teaching his people the gospel and the requirements of salvation, he said:&nbsp; ". . . and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;King Benjamin then wanted to know if his people really believed what he had said to them. I think he wanted to know if they had come to "know," "understand," and "believe" what they had been taught. Listen to what he learned:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm#_edn19" target="_self">19</a></sup></p>
<p>King Benjamin's people were prepared to act upon what they had learned and to make positive change in their lives--to become what the Lord desired of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's look again at "The Divine Law of Learning" and explore one more very important part of the learning process. Our Heavenly Father is represented at the top of the model. We need to add two more components "Teachers" and "Learners." At BYU-Idaho, before a teacher teaches he or she will pray for guidance in both the preparation and the presentation of the subject matter to be taught. Those prayers will be answered, and that two-way communication will occur and is essential to the mission of this institution. For the learner, that two-way prayerful communication is not only appropriate but imperative to the learning process. Similarly, for real learning to take place there must be two-way communication between the teacher and the learner. How else can the learner learn, and how else can the teacher know if the learner has learned? Teachers at this institution need to know early and consistently throughout the progress of a course whether every student has come to know, understand, and believe what is being taught. Only then is the teacher in a position to encourage appropriate action and positive personal change.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, what have I said to you today that I hope you will remember? I have reaffirmed what you already knew--that the glory of God is intelligence and that the more of it we acquire the better off we will be in this life and in the life to come. I have suggested that intelligence is more than being smart--that it embraces the wisdom that leads to positive personal change. I have urged you to develop a love for learning and to get all the education you can, but to always follow the counsels of God. Finally, I hope to have communicated to you the importance of viewing learning as a progressive process--that we not just learn "about" something, but that we learn "from" it--that learning is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is all about becoming the people we ought to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />With all of this, and much more importantly, I leave you my witness that over a life time I have learned that God lives, that Jesus Christ lives and is our Savior and Redeemer, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored, that the Book of Mormon is true, and that Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's living prophet today. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>There is great power in music and it is amazing how it calms the soul.&nbsp; I am truly humbled to be here in front of you today. President Clark makes it look way too easy when he stands behind this podium. I pray for the Spirit to accompany us today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles once stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">May I be bold enough to suggest that it is impossible for anyone who really knows God to doubt his willingness to receive us with open arms in a divine embrace if we will but "come unto Him."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_22_Kinghorn.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When I was 10 or 11 years old, I had an experience that helped me see the reality of Elder Holland's statement that God truly is there to receive us with open arms if we will come unto Him. It was nearing Christmas time and my older brother Matt and I were trying to find the Christmas presents that our parents had hidden. It had become a kind of unwritten challenge to find the presents and see what we were getting before Christmas morning. Whenever our parents were gone or otherwise occupied, we would search the house, but this particular year, Mom and Dad had done a great job of hiding the gifts and they were nowhere to be found.&nbsp;<br /><br />One afternoon, however, I was in our garage and I happened to look up. There in the ceiling was an access hole to the attic space above the garage and as I peered into that hole, I could see some boxes. I realized that Mom and Dad had hidden the presents up there. I ran into the house and told Matt what I had discovered. We checked to make sure Mom was busy in the kitchen and then we snuck into the upstairs bedroom of our house where there was an attic access. We crawled into the attic making sure to step on the wooden joists so we wouldn't fall through the ceiling. We worked our way over to the space above the garage and there we found all of the Christmas presents carefully stacked on a piece of plywood that spanned across several joists.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we were looking at the presents, Matt stepped to the other side of the gifts and missed stepping on a joist.&nbsp; Instead he stepped directly onto the sheetrock that made up the ceiling of the garage.As he stepped down, the sheetrock gave way and Matt fell through the ceiling. Luckily, he caught himself on the joists and I was able to help pull him back up.&nbsp; We hurriedly worked our way out of the attic and ran outside. We grabbed a ladder, a hammer, and some nails, and between the two of us, we were able to put the sheetrock back up before anyone saw what had happened. We convinced ourselves that our Dad wouldn't notice that the sheetrock was broken and we promised one another that we wouldn't say anything about what had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A few days after the ceiling incident, it was Christmas Eve and our entire family was over at my Aunt's house here in Rexburg for a family Christmas party. Toward the end of the party, Santa Claus showed up and he gave every one of us kids a bag of treats. The treat bags had one or two pieces of candy, an orange, and a whole bunch of unshelled peanuts. Matt and I weren't terribly thrilled with the peanuts so we, along with a couple of our cousins, went outside and we started throwing the peanuts at the cars driving by, an activity that I would not recommend! This was great fun until one of the cars stopped. We all ran and hid, but a woman got out of the car just as my mom came out of the house. From our hiding spot we could hear the woman give our mom an earful about what was taking place and how dangerous it was and how irresponsible those boys were and she went on and on. Our Mom apologized profusely and said she would take care of the situation.&nbsp;<br /><br />After the woman left, my mom started crying. She had been yelled at, was deeply embarrassed, and now she had to deal with her delinquent sons. When we finally came out of our hiding spot, all Mom said was, "Get in the car." We knew we were in serious trouble. That short drive home of just a few miles was the longest drive of my life. Mom didn't say a word. When we finally got home, we were sent directly to our room and mom told us that Dad would be coming to talk to us because she was too upset to deal with us. Dad came in and calmly talked to us about what we had done and why it was wrong. When he finished talking, Matt looked over at me and said, "We had better tell him everything."&nbsp; I wanted to scream "No," but we told him everything about looking at Christmas presents and falling through the ceiling in the garage.&nbsp; When we finished our confession, Dad just slowly shook his head and told us to go bed. It was the first Christmas Eve where I went straight to bed because I figured there was no point in getting up the next morning because surely, there wouldn't be anything to celebrate.&nbsp;<br /><br />But morning came, and when I went out into our living room, there sat my Mom with outstretched arms. I walked over to her and told her I was sorry. She gave me a hug and told me that she still loved me.&nbsp; For all the mistakes I had made over the past few days, my Mom was still there waiting with outstretched arms. Just as my mom was there waiting for me to come to her, our Heavenly Father is waiting to do the same thing. He is patiently waiting for us to come to Him where He can embrace us and tell us that He loves us.&nbsp;<br /><br />As Elder Holland stated, God is there to receive us with open arms if we will but come unto Him. The question then arises, how do we truly come unto Him? There are many things, such as being humble and repenting, that we must do but may I offer one simple suggestion that we can do now and continually: we can pray. Through prayer, we turn our thoughts, our actions, and our hearts toward the Lord. It is through prayer that we can feel our Savior's love and as we learn to listen for answers to our prayers, we will see the hand of the Lord in our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In Proverbs we read: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_22_Kinghorn.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball taught about the power of prayer.&nbsp; He said, and I quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After a lifetime of prayers, I know of the love and power and strength that comes from honest and heartfelt prayer. I know of the readiness of our Father to assist us in our mortal experience, to teach us, to lead us, to guide us. Thus, with great love, our Savior has said, "What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always.".<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_22_Kinghorn.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>A great and powerful example of what President Kimball said is found in the scriptures in the first book of Nephi. In Chapter 7 we read about how Nephi's brothers are angry with him so they tie him up and are going to leave him to die, but in verses 17-18 we read what happened:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound. 18 And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold, the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and I spake unto them.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_22_Kinghorn.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In that very instance, Nephi's prayer was answered and the bands were loosed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just a few chapters later, however, Nephi's experience and the way his prayer was answered proved to be very different. In Chapter 18 of First Nephi, Lehi and his family have all boarded the ship that Nephi built and they are sailing across the ocean. Once again Nephi's brothers become angry with Nephi and they tie him up.&nbsp; I can only imagine that Nephi prayed with the same fervor with which he prayed in Chapter 7 and I know that his faith had not decreased. In fact, I would bet that his faith was even stronger and yet, this time, the bands were not loosed and Nephi suffered for several days. The weather turned horrible, and their compass, the Liahona, stopped working. Finally, after four days of this, Nephi's brothers were so scared about dying that they finally untied Nephi. After he was freed, Nephi prayed unto the Lord and the seas calmed and the compass once again began to work. I love that Nephi takes the opportunity to teach us and explains why his prayer was answered in a different manner. In verse 11 of Chapter 18 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken concerning the wicked.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_22_Kinghorn.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The Lord heard and answered Nephi's prayer, but the answer was probably not what Nephi had hoped for at that time. What is powerful here is that Nephi knew that the Lord had heard him and as he reflected back on the experience, he was able to see how the Lord used that experience to direct his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to witness, as Nephi had, direct and not so direct answers to my own prayers. Back in January of this year, my brother-in-law, who had just turned 50, set the goal for himself to climb to the top of the Grand Teton, a mountain peak just across the Idaho border in Wyoming that stands at 13,775 feet in elevation. Two of my brothers and I had climbed the mountain before and agreed to help him reach his goal. This adventure quickly turned into a family affair and when we left on the trip at the end of August there were 7 of us total--4 brothers, 2 brothers-in-law, and my brother's climbing partner. Our plan had been to hit the trail at about 3 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, summit, and come all the way back down but due to some concerns about the weather on Tuesday, we made a last minute decision to leave Monday night and hike through the night so that we could summit as early as possible before the weather hit.&nbsp; We were not able to move as fast as we had hoped, but the weather held and we were all able to summit late Tuesday morning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Storm clouds were moving in so we only spent a few minutes on the top of the mountain. Because of our later summit, by the time we started down, we were the only group still on the mountain. As part of our descent, we had two significant rappels that we had to do. A rappel is a way to move down a steep section of rock using a rope that passes through a device that provides friction. We navigated the first rappel without incident, but the second rappel proved to be a different story. This particular rappel consisted of dropping vertically 10 or 15 feet to a ledge and then backing off that ledge and dropping vertically for over 100 feet. We got our ropes set up and then carefully stacked the ropes so that they would unravel properly as we threw them over the edge.&nbsp;<br /><br />My brother Matt was the first one to rappel down. He went over the edge and disappeared from sight. We waited for him to reach the bottom and for the tension to come off the rope. We kept waiting and waiting. A few minutes passed and we started yelling to Matt to see if he was o.k. The wind was blowing which made it difficult to hear, but finally in a lull in the wind, Matt was able to tell us that there was a knot in the rope. Two knots had actually formed in the rope as it twisted and unraveled when we threw it over. Matt had been able to work the first knot out, but the second knot got into his rappelling device and he was completely stuck on the knot. Matt had been trying everything to get the knot out. He had tied what is called a prussic to the line to try and ascend back up the rope, but had been unsuccessful in doing so. We couldn't see Matt, but we knew he had to be exhausted. At this point we called 911 and were patched through to the ranger station. The ranger told us they could get a helicopter, but with the weather rolling in as it was, we didn't have time for that to happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />We decided our best bet was to try to pull Matt back up to the ledge so that he could stand and get the knot out of his rappelling device. Through the wind we asked Matt how far he was from the ledge. We thought we heard "six feet." There was only space for 4 of us to grab hold of the rope, but we figured we could pull Matt up six feet. We pulled and pulled and pulled with everything we had and then tied the rope off. We had pulled at least 6 feet but the rope was still taut. We yelled again to Matt to see how close he was to the ledge and this time we clearly heard that he was 60 feet from the ledge. I couldn't believe it. My arms were burning and I remember thinking to myself that there was no way we would be able to pull him up 60 more feet. Just as I had that thought, my brother Kyle said that we needed to say a prayer. We bowed our heads and Kyle prayed that we would have the strength to save our brother and then we started pulling and strength truly came that was not our own. For every foot of progress, we would lose several inches due to the give in the rope and having to reposition our hands, but slowly and surely we were finally able to pull Matt to the ledge where he was able to stand and get the knot out of his rappelling device and then rappel down safely.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the very instance of need, our prayer was answered as we were given the strength to pull our brother to safety.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several hours later however, our sincere prayers were answered in a very different manner. After getting everyone down off the rappel, it started to rain. The rain made the rocks very slick which made the descent event more difficult, but the greater challenge was that the steep descent had taken its toll on my brother-in-law's knees and he was struggling with every step. He was a real trooper and never complained, but he was in a lot of pain and it really slowed our progress as we descended down off the mountain. The rain finally stopped, but the sun quickly set and we once again found ourselves hiking in the dark. We had made it through the technical parts of the mountain, but we still had several miles to hike and by this time we had been awake for over 40 hours straight. As we continued down, we came to a meadow and then a large boulder field and once in the boulder field, we lost the trail. We searched and searched, but could not find the trail to take us out of the boulder field.&nbsp; We worked our way back to the meadow because we knew there was a sign there that would indicate we were in the right spot but we could not find the sign. We all prayed that we would find our way out and we had great faith that we would be guided to know what to do, but as hard as we tried, we could not find the trail or the sign indicating where we were.&nbsp;<br /><br />We began to think that we had possibly missed a turn so while the others rested, my other brother-in-law and I hiked back up the mountain to try to find a fork in the trail and to also see if we could get cell phone reception to let our families know that we were o.k. We were not successful in either endeavor. We were finally so exhausted that we turned around and went back down to the meadow where our brothers were sleeping. When we reached them, we happened to look across the creek and in the faint light of our headlamps we saw something. We walked over to it and there, not 50 ft. from where our brothers were resting, was the metal sign indicating the trail and verifying that we were going the right way. We had walked past that spot at least a dozen times and had not seen the sign. We were elated to know that we were in the right spot, but we made the conscious decision to rest for a bit to clear the fog from our sleep deprived minds. We slept for a couple of hours on the side of the trail and when we awoke, our minds were clear. We re-entered the boulder field, found the trail through it and were able to safely hike out the rest of the way. Our prayers were answered, but in a different way than we had anticipated.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Richard G. Scott once stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sometimes answers to prayers are not recognized because we are too intent on wanting confirmation of our own desires. We fail to see that the Lord would have us do something else. Be careful to seek His will.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_22_Kinghorn.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Our desire had been to find that trail and make it out that night. We didn't want our families to worry and frankly, we really didn't want to have them send Search and Rescue in to find us. We really just wanted to get off that mountain, but we failed to see the Lord's will. He not only wanted us to get off the mountain, but He wanted us to make it all the way home safely. I also firmly believe that He wanted us to learn something from this experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The lesson that was learned was quite simple: the sign and the trail, the very answers to our prayers that we had been seeking, had been there the entire time but due to exhaustion and sleep deprivation, we had not been able to see those answers. The actual answer to our prayer was that we needed to sleep and then the way would be shown. Too often, Heavenly Father answers our prayers, but because of our own physical, emotional, or spiritual fatigue, we are not in a condition to hear or see the answers He has placed before us. Often times, we need to just stop for a minute, let our minds clear, and then look for the answers that have been provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my testimony that our Father in Heaven is waiting to receive us with open arms if we will but "come unto Him." As we draw ourselves near to Him through prayer, He will hear and answer us. As we seek His will in our lives, we will be guided and strengthened in all that we do and this I say in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus Member, First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Joe Junior Christensen&nbsp;(born July 21, 1929) was the&nbsp;president&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ricks College&nbsp;from 1985 to 1989 and has been a&nbsp;general authority&nbsp;in&nbsp;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&nbsp;(LDS Church) since 1989. He was also&nbsp;president&nbsp;of the&nbsp;San Diego California Temple&nbsp;from 1999 to 2002.<br /><br />Christensen served as an officer in the&nbsp;United States Air Force<sup id="cite_ref-1">[1]</sup>&nbsp;during the&nbsp;Korean War, from 1953 to 1955.<sup id="cite_ref-2">[2]</sup>&nbsp;He received a&nbsp;bachelor's degree&nbsp;from&nbsp;Brigham Young University&nbsp;and a Ph.D. from&nbsp;Washington State University.<br /><br />For a few months in 1970 Christensen served as&nbsp;president&nbsp;of the LDS Church's&nbsp;mission&nbsp;headquartered in&nbsp;Mexico City. He was, however, soon afterward appointed to work under&nbsp;Neal A. Maxwell&nbsp;in running the church's&nbsp;seminaries&nbsp;and&nbsp;institutes&nbsp;and was replaced as mission president.<sup id="cite_ref-3">[3]</sup><br /><br />Christensen was associate commissioner of the&nbsp;Church Educational System&nbsp;from 1970 to 1985, interrupted by a four-year term as president of the LDS Church's&nbsp;Missionary Training Center&nbsp;in&nbsp;Provo, Utah. In 1985, Christensen became president of Ricks College in&nbsp;Rexburg, Idaho.<br /><br />In 1989, Christensen was called as a general authority in LDS Church, where among other assignments, he served in the&nbsp;Presidency of the Seventy.<sup id="cite_ref-4">[4]</sup>&nbsp;He was given general authority&nbsp;emeritus&nbsp;status in 1999.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a humbling privilege to be here with you today.&nbsp;A generation ago, my wife and I had the opportunity of serving for a number of years while I was president of what was then Ricks College. We came here way back in 1985. That was 28 years ago! Some of your parents would have been students here at that time.&nbsp;We have watched from the sidelines the great progress that is being made here at BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />There are a lot of fine institutions of higher education, but in my opinion, you students are blessed to be enrolled in the best geographical, educational, social, and spiritual university setting you could find anywhere. President Clark and his staff and faculty are doing an outstanding job.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you take full advantage of this experience, when you graduate you will leave here remarkably prepared in at least four ways:&nbsp;<br /><br />First: Academic competence in your area of study.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second: Preparation to be a teacher and a leader in and out of the Church wherever you go.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third: An enlarged and refined understanding and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fourth: An inner spiritual commitment to stand by your standards and convictions in whatever environment you may find yourself. In other words, you can become more independently righteous so that, as President Brigham Young said, you will be able to be "righteous even in the dark."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />As I mentioned, some of your parents were probably students here when we called Rexburg home. A lot can happen in a generation, technologically and otherwise. I recently read the following insightful observation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Twenty years ago, if you had asked someone to "e-mail me" or said, "check out my Web site (or blog)," or began a phrase with "www" or asked if an article was "available online," you would have received a blank stare. "Amazon" was known simply as a forest in South America, and "google" meant nothing.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The Church has also progressed, and is progressing, in remarkable ways. For example, I responded to the call to serve in the Mexican Mission in October of 1948 (65 years ago!). At that time, there were only a few more than 2,000 missionaries serving throughout the world. We were told that our October 1948 group of about 350 missionaries was the largest the Church had ever had in one month.&nbsp; By way of contrast, in August of this year, 5,855 missionaries arrived at Missionary Training Centers around the world -- more than 16 times as many!&nbsp;<br /><br />Back then, the Mexican Mission included all of Mexico, plus the seven countries of Central America. When I was released in 1951, there were just over 5,000 members of the Church in all those countries combined. There was one mission, no stakes, and no temples. Now in Mexico and Central America there are 52 missions, 331 stakes, 18 operating temples, and more than 1.8 million members. Most of the converts have come into the Church as a result of the efforts of missionaries the ages of many of you in this audience. It is truly a miracle!&nbsp;<br /><br />How and why did this happen? I believe principally because the Spirit guides to all truth. It bears witness that Jesus is the Christ and testifies of the powerful ideas contained in the restored gospel -- ideas that can satisfy the most inquiring minds.&nbsp;<br /><br />I do not have words sufficient to express my gratitude for the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the powerful ideas that are contained within it.&nbsp;<br /><br />These ideas contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ are truly life changing. Years ago, I taught an LDS doctrine and philosophy course during the summer session at the institute of religion adjacent to the University of Utah. As I became acquainted with the class members on the first day, one of the students introduced herself as a nonmember. She was a very bright, attractive third-year student majoring in history and political science.&nbsp;<br /><br />She asked a lot of questions and participated freely in class discussion; her presence in the class helped to stimulate all of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Generally, things seemed to be going along well in the class. We had discussed our Latter-day Saint ideas relating to the nature of the Godhead, man's relationship to God, revelation from God to man, and so on.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, three weeks before the summer session was to end, she stopped coming.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wondered and worried about what I might have unintentionally said that could have offended her in any way.We had no further contact until September, when students began registering for the fall quarter. She called my office and arranged to come and visit for a few minutes.&nbsp;<br /><br />When she arrived, her conversation went something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Last summer, I registered for your course so I could find out more about what you Mormons believe. I had met a medical student who was a returned missionary. We had dated a few times, and I was interested in him. I decided I wanted to find out more about his beliefs in a setting where he was not present and where I would feel free to ask any questions I had on my mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As it turns out, all that is behind us. We are not going together anymore.</p>
<p>She glanced down at her handkerchief that she had wound around her fingers and continued, "I suppose you are wondering why I stopped coming to your class last summer."&nbsp;<br /><br />I nodded, and she continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Well, on the first day that I missed the class, as I was walking across campus toward the institute building, the thought crossed my mind, 'What if all this is true?' That thought -- as she said it -- spooked me so badly that I decided not to go back to class again. I would just drop the course and get away from it. I returned to my own church. I joined the choir. I even joined the civic action program sponsored by the church. I was there every Sunday and in between. I immersed myself in all the activities, but in spite of all my efforts, the ideas would not let me go.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is there something more that I could study about the Church?</p>
<p>She enrolled in a Book of Mormon course, met with the missionaries, and became a member of the Church--all because "the ideas would not let her go." She later married and moved to the Northwest. I don't know whether she has continued to be active in the Church or not, but I think one thing is sure: she will never be the same again. Once the powerful ideas of the gospel stretch our minds and spirits, and after knowing and believing even some of them, we are never again the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, as William M. Paxton wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ideas go booming through the world louder than cannon. Thoughts are mightier than armies. Principles have achieved more victories than horsemen or chariots.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The ideas and messages contained in the fullness of the gospel and the plan of salvation can satisfy the most inquiring, sincere minds. &nbsp;Unfortunately, trends indicate a decline in membership in mainline Christian churches. Studies have indicated that among Americans generally, those with more formal education are not as active in their churches as those with less education. However, research has shown that within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the situation is just the opposite. Church activity is higher among Latter-day Saints who have the most formal education. In fact, nearly 85 percent of members who are college graduates have a high degree of religious commitment, compared with only 50 percent of those with just a high school education.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;I believe this is the result of being exposed to and understanding the great ideas of the restored gospel.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had an experience that illustrates this notion:&nbsp;<br /><br />I served for a time as a member of the Association of Directors of Religion at a university in the Northwest. A broad variety of faiths was represented in the group. We met monthly to discuss common concerns about our assignments with the university students of our particular denominations. One Monday morning before the meeting had formally begun, I was seated to the left of one of my Protestant minister friends. I can still see it in my mind's eye. He leaned back in his chair with his hands clasped behind his head and, in his typical manner of expression, shared a concern and question. It went something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It seems to me that in the evolutionary development of college-age religiosity, we have come to a time when it is no longer considered relevant by university students to attend Sunday evening worship services.</p>
<p>In other words, attendance among his group was decreasing.&nbsp;<br /><br />He turned to his right, and asked, "How do you find it in your group?" Each minister in his own way agreed that, over time, the attendance in their groups was decreasing in their worship services.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, after everyone else in the circle had commented, my turn came. At the time, I was also serving as the bishop of the student ward. Coincidentally, at our ward's sacrament meeting the night before this meeting, a note was handed to me by Brother Huber, our ward clerk. It contained the following message: "Congratulations, Bishop! Tonight we have the highest sacrament meeting attendance we have had since we were called to serve." Our experience was just the opposite of all the ministers who had responded. The attendance of our university students was steadily increasing. I tried to figure out a way to report that to the group as humbly as possible.&nbsp;<br /><br />For a few moments, let's turn our focus to the Prophet Joseph Smith, through whom God restored these powerful ideas of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />The angel Moroni appeared to Joseph on the twenty-first of September in 1823. Joseph said of this visit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He called me by name, and said that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a></sup></p>
<p>This is a most remarkable prophecy! Anyone could hope that his or her name would be had for good -- not evil, of course -- among all nations, and it simply would not happen. Most of us will not be known outside of the immediate area where we live.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we all know, there was much evil spoken of the Prophet and much evil done to him and those who believed his message. Almost from the beginning, Joseph Smith's name was vilified as the vast majority of the nonbelievers around him spoke slanderous evil of him. He was attacked verbally and even physically by those who should have given him at least the common human courtesy of tolerant patience. After he told others of his remarkable experience in the Sacred Grove, many began charging that he was lazy, indolent, opportunistic, psychologically unbalanced, immoral, lecherous, heretical, blasphemous -- and the list goes on and on. Indeed, evil has been spoken of him in the past, and there are those who continue to do so today, but I tend to look for the positive.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fortunately, over the years, some good has been spoken of the Prophet Joseph Smith as well. Some very respected nonmember scholars have come to recognize the significance of his work and contributions. For example, Dr. Harold Bloom, a distinguished professor of humanities at Yale University has written about Joseph Smith. Although I don't agree with everything he wrote, I do agree with some of his statements about the contributions of the prophet Joseph Smith. For Example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If there is already in place any authentic version of the American Religion then, as Tolstoy surmised, it must be Mormonism, whose future as yet may prove decisive for the nation, and for more than this nation alone.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn6" target="_self">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Bloom continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I also do not find it possible to doubt that Joseph Smith was an authentic prophet. Where in all of American history can we find his match? In proportion to his importance and his complexity, Joseph Smith remains the least-studied personage, of an undiminished vitality, in our entire national saga.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup></p>
<p>That is quite a statement!&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the greatest aspects of the Prophet Joseph Smith's ministry was the continuous flow of revelation that came through him to become scripture. President Stephen L. Richards, a former counselor in the First Presidency, said this about the contributions of Joseph Smith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">His literary labors must not be forgotten. He produced more scripture, that is, the revealed word of God, than any other man of whom we have record. Indeed, his total scriptural productions would almost equal those of all others put together.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>President Richards continued: "The society which Joseph Smith established is without question the peer of all social systems on the earth."&nbsp;<br /><br />The Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred at the young age of thirty-eight. The Doctrine and Covenants contains this tribute about him: "Joseph Smith did more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;This tribute has been supported by the testimonies of literally millions of others whose lives have been changed for the better by the work of Joseph Smith.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Brigham Young said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I feel like shouting Hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom the Lord raised up and ordained, and to whom he gave keys and power to build up the Kingdom of God on earth and sustain it.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn10" target="_self">10</a></sup></p>
<p>I also feel like shouting hallelujah all the time when I think that I ever had the privilege of knowing even a portion of the powerful ideas revealed through Joseph Smith the Prophet that to me are so intellectually and spiritually satisfying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Listen to these words from President Stephen L. Richards:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If any man has received in his heart the witness of the divine truth embraced in the contributions of the Prophet Joseph, I charge him to be true, -- true to his testimony, true to the Prophet, the founder, true to the cause and its duly commissioned leaders, true to the covenants he has made in holy places, and true to the brotherhood of man in the service that he renders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To anyone who has not yet received a witness of the restored gospel, President Richards gave the assurance that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you will receive and apply the teachings of Joseph Smith you will be made happy. Doubt and uncertainty will leave you. Glorious purpose will come into life. Family ties will be sweeter. Friendships will be dearer.Service will be nobler, and the peace of Christ will be his portion.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>These are blessings that anyone would give almost anything to receive.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you finish your studies here at BYU-Idaho, many of you will enter the work force; others will go on to graduate studies, including attending some of the academically elite universities. You will all be tempted and challenged in every way-- including challenges to your intellect, your moral standards, your beliefs, and your lifestyle. A few of you will even face those who would take your very lives simply because you are Christian-- and especially a Mormon.&nbsp;<br /><br />How can we make sure that the life-changing contributions of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration become infused in our souls and in our actions in light of these challenges? Among so many that could be mentioned, here are five very practical suggestions that can help each of us. These suggestions are not new. We have all heard them before. But, this afternoon, let's candidly and honestly analyze ourselves and make whatever adjustments in what we are doing or not doing wherever they are needed.&nbsp;<br /><br />1. Listen to and faithfully follow the counsel of the living prophets.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord's anointed will not lead us astray. We heard great counsel from them during the last general conference. We should now review and carefully study their messages to see how our lives can and should be improved. Of what value is it to have living prophets if we do not heed their counsel?&nbsp;<br /><br />2. Read scriptures daily.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are commanded to "feast upon the words of Christ"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;and not just nibble. Every day, we should find a time when we can really study the scriptures without interruption. Remember that our iPhone, iPad, iPod, computer, or whatever has an "off" switch. We should use it. Turn it off and avoid being interrupted by text messages or interrupting audible or visual announcements of any kind. Let the power of the scriptures feed our minds, hearts, and spirits.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember President Spencer W. Kimball's statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures, the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>There is no book that testifies more convincingly that Jesus is the Christ than the Book of Mormon. Scholars have found that there are 3,925 references to the Lord in its pages. On average, the book has a reference to the Savior every 1.7 verses.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon is indeed another testament that Jesus is the Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. Really pray and don't just "say prayers."&nbsp;<br /><br />In the rush of things in our busy lives, there are occasions when meaningful prayer does not exist. And there are times when we may not feel like praying. Remember what President Brigham Young said: "It matters not whether you or I feel like praying. If we do not feel like it, we should pray till we do."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;We should ask ourselves, "Am I really communicating the deep feelings of my heart and not just repeating trite expressions?"&nbsp;<br /><br />On a few occasions, I attended meetings where President Marion G. Romney, a former counselor in the First Presidency, offered the prayer. He prayed with such sincerity and humility. I wished that I had anywhere near that capacity. Some people really learn how to pray, and it is a goal for which we all should strive.&nbsp;<br /><br />4. Decide now to be strictly morally clean and not get involved in any form of pornography.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pornography is all around us, and every one of us knows that. At the click of a computer mouse, we can be flooded with the vilest of immoral images, and watching such trash can become addictive. Our spirituality, our activity in the Church, and even our marriages can be destroyed by it.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Hinckley has said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pornography grows increasingly worse. It is like a raging storm, destroying individuals and families, utterly ruining what was once wholesome and beautiful. I speak of pornography in all of its manifestations.</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I know that I am speaking directly and plainly. I do so because the Internet has made pornography more widely accessible, adding to what is available on DVDs and videos, on television and magazine stands. It leads to fantasies that are destructive of self-respect. It leads to illicit relationships, often to disease, and to abusive criminal activity.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a></sup></p>
<p>In the following general conference, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, motivated by the same inspiration, gave a powerful address on the same subject. He said, "I know that many of you are exposed to pornography and that many of you are being stained by it."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;I ask that you stand with me today in pledging to stay clean from the plague of pornography.&nbsp;<br /><br />5. Keep worthy to have and use a current temple recommend as frequently as circumstances permit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of all these suggestions, worthily having and using a temple recommend is the most comprehensive and important way to keep safe from the sins of the world wherever we may be.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember the nonmember university student who found that the ideas of the gospel "would not let her go." Each of us needs to study these ideas, learn them, and recommit to live our lives consistently with them. The gospel of Jesus Christ not only is world changing but also can and should be truly life changing for each of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember that the gospel of Jesus Christ embraces all truth. As members of the Church, I am grateful that we are not asked to believe anything that is not true. Courageously stand for the eternal truth contained in the gospel and remember the powerful words of President John Taylor:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Truth will stand proud and erect, unsullied and uncontaminated by the pestiferous breath of calumniating mortals, and no power can stay its progress.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn18" target="_self">18</a></sup></p>
<p>You are a vital part of this unprecedented progress. The Lord is hastening his work in its time.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;We should become independently capable of being firm and true to our commitments and sacred covenants wherever we are. As President Brigham Young said, we should become righteous "even in the dark."&nbsp;<br /><br />We respect you. We have confidence in you. We trust you. And we love you. How reassuring it is to have living prophets such as the Prophet Joseph Smith who could share such a straight-forward statement as this from his personal experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That He lives! For we saw Him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that He is the Only Begotten of the Father-- That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_29_Christensen.htm#_edn20" target="_self">20</a></sup></p>
<p>I testify that the restored gospel is true. Our Heavenly Father knows and loves all of us as his sons and daughters. Jesus is the Christ, and this is His Church led by living prophets. May we all develop an inner spiritual commitment to stand by our standards and convictions in whatever environment we find ourselves - even in the dark. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am thrilled to be with you today. I so much appreciate the wonderful prayer and music that has set the stage for this devotional. I wish to begin with a brief letter sent to Dr. Stuart Robertshaw, who founded The National Association for the Humor Impaired. Dr. Robertshaw is also known as Dr. Humor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dear Dr. Humor,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My brother works for a telemarketing firm that sells products by phone.&nbsp; One day he called a home phone and the phone was answered by a small boy in a whisper.&nbsp; All of the boy's responses were whispered in the following conversation:&nbsp;"Is your father home?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yes."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"May I speak to him?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"No."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Is your mother home?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yes."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"May I speak to her?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"No."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Is there anyone else there?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yes."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Who else is there?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"A policeman."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Who else is there?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Two fireman."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What are they doing?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Looking for me."<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>I have been looking for you also. It is truly an honor to join with you and to feel your goodness and potential for blessing others, for scattering sunshine.&nbsp; Also, I hope this message will be accompanied by the presence and promptings of the Holy Ghost. I pray that you will be responsive to these promptings.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />As I spoke to my sweetheart, Linda, about this invitation to be with you, I asked her what I should speak about. Her reply was immediate and precise. "You should speak about what it means to be generous, to show a generosity of spirit." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Just exactly what does it mean to exhibit a generosity of spirit? What does it look like? How does it feel when we are the recipients of it? Why is it so important in our lives and those of others? What if this campus grew in its generosity of spirit?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We know that "doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure." It is what the Savior did. He wants us to be generous. He wants us to go about doing good.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Generosity of spirit is about cheering up the sad and making someone feel glad. When I was younger and quite immature, I used to sing, "Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel bad, if not I have failed indeed."&nbsp; I have since repented of singing this verse of the hymn.&nbsp;<br /><br />Generosity is about sharing, lightening burdens, helping others on their way, and giving hope.&nbsp; As the Savior taught, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn3" target="_self"><sup><sup>3</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Og Mandino said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself.<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn4" target="_self">4</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Generosity produces the same effects. We are blessed as we freely and willingly engage in the "slightest actions [that] often meet the sorest needs."<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn5" target="_self">5</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, we need to be generous in our tithes and offerings as encouraged by our Church leaders, but these kinds of generosity and charitable giving need to be accompanied by personal acts of generosity characterized by the Godly attributes of kindness, mercy, compassion, and charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When we manifest a generosity of spirit, we are behaving in a Christ-like fashion. We are blessing others.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the message conveyed by the Apostle John when he wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We [are] the sons [and daughters] of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him . . .</p>
<p>To be like Him is to be full of charity, kindness, and generosity. We become like Him as we daily strive to mirror His life of goodness and generosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Generosity comes in many forms and sizes. Often when it is given, it is puzzling if not troubling for some of its recipients. Think about these remarks made by King Lamoni's father to Aaron and his brethren:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity . . . of thy brother Ammon;<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, generosity can be troubling and surprising to many who do not believe they merit it or others who do not expect it. Elder Neal A. Maxwell in writing about this event provided this commentary:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The king in the Book of Mormon who was deeply impressed with the generosity shown by Ammon knew that he had experienced someone who was special.</p>
<p>Those who experience generosity like that provided by Ammon can be fundamentally and deeply touched. They can be prepared for other experiences with God, Jesus Christ, and His Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />My attempts at Ammon-like generosity are generally small. I love putting freshly made cookies in a laundry bag provided by our cleaners. I like to imagine what happens at the cleaners when the attendant opens the bag, sorts our laundry, and discovers the cookies. Check out this note from the cleaners attached to our recently processed laundry.<em>&nbsp;</em><em>You guys are the best.&nbsp;</em><br /><br />I really like the heart at the end of this brief note--generosity is all about giving from the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In this regard, I hope some of you enjoyed the cookies I sent to some of your apartments. I hope they brightened your day and spawned some generosity on your part.&nbsp;<br /><br />Generosity of spirit is evident in unexpected listening, genuine compliments, expressions of gratitude, the sharing of talents, unmerited patience, and all kinds of giving. For you, this generosity of spirit may include doing the dishes when you are not assigned, taking out the garbage spontaneously and happily, using precious little hot water when you are showering especially when three to five others are to follow, an unprompted bathroom cleaning, or other unanticipated acts of generosity and kindness. If we are to become disciples, discipleship must be practiced and evidenced every day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's now consider this question posed by the lawyer to Christ: "And who is my neighbor?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup><sup>9</sup></sup></a>&nbsp; This question gave rise to the wonderful parable of the Good Samaritan given by Christ. We are all very familiar with this parable.&nbsp; Let me highlight one theme that always catches my attention and pierces my conscience. It is this. A certain priest and the Levite "passed by on the other side."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup><sup>10</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;They chose not to show mercy on him who was "half dead." How often do we ignore those or pass by those who need some generosity, some mercy, and some kindness--especially those in our families or those in our apartments? We really need to be neighbors to each other.&nbsp; We need to be disciples.&nbsp;<br /><br />In this regard, you are all great detectors of genuineness and true discipleship. You know when someone is giving from the heart. The Apostle Paul spoke about authentic giving--about giving with pure intent.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup><sup>11</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;He spoke about our motivations, intentions, and purposes for being generous. Do we give grudgingly, out of necessity, or out of duty<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup><sup>12</sup></sup></a>?&nbsp; He concluded, "God loveth a cheerful giver.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup><sup>13</sup></sup></a>"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We love cheerful givers too. In this regard, do those who experience you up close and personal, feel your cheerfulness, especially when you give? Are you known for scattering sunshine--His sunshine?<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Elder Holland has taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The word&nbsp;<em>generosity</em>&nbsp;has the same derivation as the word&nbsp;<em>genealogy,</em>&nbsp;both coming from the Latin&nbsp;<em>genus,</em>&nbsp;meaning of the same birth or kind, the same family or gender.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup><sup>14</sup></sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup>We will always find it easier to be generous when we remember that this person being favored is truly one of our own.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup><sup>15</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we manifest a generosity of spirit we are bighearted, unselfish, and openhanded. Our hearts and hands are open to giving. When we are stingy of spirit, we are miserly, selfish, and tightfisted. Our hearts and hands are closed to giving. We are not "kindly affectioned one to another."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup><sup>16</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />When someone reaches out to us in a spontaneous and thoughtful fashion, we are generally touched by his or her actions. Such was my experience with Bowe, a young deacon in our ward. I did not know him well nor did he know me well. Following our block of meetings, he said, "Brother Egan, I want to do some service for you?"&nbsp; Never before had this happened to me--a spontaneous and genuine request to simply serve me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />At the appointed time for his service, I picked him up. We drove to my home and together we washed two cars thoroughly.&nbsp; He squirted. He scrubbed. He vacuumed. He cleaned each car window. He shined each car with a towel.&nbsp; His contributions were freely and cheerfully given. I will never forget his kindness to me. I was totally touched by his generosity of spirit. Even now, his service evokes feelings of love and kindness within me.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson captured my feelings when he wrote:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God bless all who endeavor to be their brother's keeper, who give to ameliorate suffering, who strive with all that is good within them to make a better world. Have you noticed that such individuals have a brighter smile? Their footsteps are more certain. They have an aura of contentment and satisfaction, even dedication, for one cannot participate in helping others without experiencing a rich blessing himself.<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn17" target="_self">17</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Great blessings attend those who authentically reach out to the others, who scatter sunshine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Families can also provide lasting acts of generosity and kindness.&nbsp; I want you to meet the Shallenbergers and the Howards. Regularly these families scatter sunshine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />First, I want you to meet Robbie Shallenberger. He is 11 years old. He and his family regularly scatter sunshine. Often when the family treats itself to a fast-food meal, they pay for the meal of the family or individual in the car behind them. It all began when Robbie's dad was a university student and someone in the car ahead of him paid for his parking. Now many years later, Rob and his family regularly continue the practice of surprising others with generosity.&nbsp; Robbie sums up his feelings about generosity in this fashion:<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>Being generous means you are being kind to someone else. Just like the guy that was very kind to my dad when he was in college. When you are kind to someone else, they might think, "Gosh that was really cool. I like the feeling.&nbsp; Maybe I should do it to someone else."&nbsp; Then those people will think that was a really good feeling. I want to do it to someone else. It just creates a big ripple effect.</p>
<p>Imagine how individuals or families in the car behind them feel when they discover their meal or treat has been provided by anonymous donors.&nbsp; Robbie is quick to mention that they exit quickly from the drive-up window with great joy knowing they have really surprised someone. They do, however, quickly look in the rearview mirror to see the responses on the receivers' faces. For both the giver and the receiver, generosity evokes a thumbs-up response.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Shallenbergers regularly scatter sunshine. They give hope through their kindness and generosity. Imagine Robbie as a missionary, husband, and father, having undergone this kind of family training in being generous and in scattering sunshine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another provider of brilliant sunshine is the Howard Family. Carol and Lee have established a remarkable legacy in their neighborhood. Each month, they host a wonderful dinner for all of the widows and newcomers in their ward and related neighborhood. A carefully crafted invitation is sent to each individual, inviting him or her to come to dinner. When these sisters and others come to their home, they enjoy a wonderful social and a scrumptious meal--gifts cheerfully given by Lee and Carol and gifts gladly received by the sweet widowed sisters and newcomers.&nbsp;<br /><br />My mother, Marcia Egan, now 91, loves attending this social each month in the company of her contemporaries and newcomers. She believes Carol and Lee are well on their way to sainthood now. They have been doing this for 10 years. They do this out of the best kind of motivation, love. They, like the Savior, are going about doing good. In doing so, they are becoming like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Generosity of spirit can also be manifest in men. Men are capable of great good. What follows are some of my favorite stories about remarkably generous men.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Stranded in an airport because of bad weather, a young mother and her two-year-old daughter had been waiting in long lines for hours trying to get a flight home. The child was tired and fussy, but the mother, who was pregnant and at risk of miscarriage, did not pick her up. A doctor had advised the mother to avoid lifting the two-year-old unless absolutely necessary. The woman overheard disapproving comments from people around her as she used her foot to slide her crying daughter along in the line. Nobody offered to help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But then, the woman later recalled, "someone came towards us and with a kindly smile said, 'Is there something I could do to help you?' With a grateful sigh I accepted his offer. He lifted my sobbing little daughter from the cold floor and lovingly held her to him while he patted her gently on the back. He asked if she could chew a piece of gum. When she was settled down, he carried her with him and said something kindly to the others in the line ahead of me, about how I needed their help. They seemed to agree and then he went up to the ticket counter [at the front of the line] and made arrangements with the clerk for me to be put on a flight leaving shortly. He walked with us to a bench, where we chatted a moment, until he was assured that I would be fine. He went on his way. About a week later I saw a picture of Apostle Spencer W. Kimball and recognized him as the stranger in the airport."<sup>&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn18" target="_self">18</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>What an outstanding example<sup>&nbsp;</sup>of generosity, of scattering sunshine.&nbsp; Years passed and President Kimball received a letter that read, in part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dear President Kimball:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am a student at Brigham Young University. I have just returned from my mission in Munich, West Germany. I had a lovely mission and learned much...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was sitting in priesthood meeting last week, when a story was told of a loving service which you performed some twenty-one years ago in the Chicago airport. The story told of how you met a young pregnant mother with a ... screaming child [who was] in ... distress, waiting in a long line for her tickets. She was threatening miscarriage and therefore couldn't lift her child to comfort her. She had experienced four previous miscarriages, which gave added reason for the doctor's orders not to bend or lift.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You comforted the crying child and explained the dilemma to the other passengers in line. This act of love took the strain and tension off my mother. I was born a few months later in Flint, Michigan.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I just wanted to&nbsp;<em>thank you</em>&nbsp;for your love.&nbsp;<em>Thank you</em>&nbsp;for your example!<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn19" target="_self">19</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Unexpected generosity leaves lasting and powerful impressions upon others and us.&nbsp; We are blessed in profound ways when we, like the Savior, go about doing good; when we scatter sunshine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another example of generosity of spirit is conveyed by Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone.&nbsp; He related the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I had reorganized a stake. Just as I was getting ready to go out to the airport where I could relax, a woman approached me. She was in her mature years and she said, "Elder Featherstone, are you going back to Salt Lake City today?" I said, "Yes." She continued, "Are you going on that four o'clock flight?" I responded that I was. Then she said, "Would you mind doing a favor for me?" I quickly thought about the schedule I had just been through, and the flesh was begging for a little break. I assumed she wanted me to hand carry something to her relatives. I never check baggage unless I absolutely have to. I wondered if I would have to check what it was I assumed she wanted me to bring back. I thought about waiting at the baggage claim for the item; then I wondered where it would need to be delivered. Only a moment's pondering and as always, the spirit thrust aside all empty excuses and I responded as a service-oriented leader should.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I said, "I will be glad to help in whatever way possible." Then the woman said, "My grandson Phillip has been down here with me for a couple of weeks. How would you like to baby-sit him home to Salt Lake City? He is two-and-a-half years old. His mother will be waiting for him at the airport." We arranged to meet at the Los Angeles Airport, where the grandmother introduced me to Phillip.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When we arrived in Salt Lake City, there was no one to meet us. We walked the length of the airport terminal. Still no one recognized Phillip. We went down the escalator, past the baggage claim, and out to the street. I have done some unusual things in our marriage, but I wondered what my wife would say when I came home from a stake conference visit and brought a two-and-a-half-year-old boy with me.<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn20" target="_self">20</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>The mother of Phillip eventually arrived at the pick-up curb and Elder Featherstone was relieved to have the young two-year-old in his mother's care. But he was also spiritually content, having provided needed help, having scattered sunshine. His willingness to scatter sunshine has brought joy to many during his lifetime.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a sidebar to our discussion today, I want you to think about this question, realizing that you may need to be certain that the person responding to the question has a good relationship with you--a relationship that has been affirmed with a good&nbsp;<em>DTR,&nbsp;</em>a solid<em>, define-the-relationship</em>&nbsp;conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The question is this: How is your&nbsp;<em>generositas</em>? This is a weighty question, but it is not about weight. I really like the sound of this word--generositas.&nbsp; It has an academic feel to it. You may even pose this question to yourself. How is my generositas? Am I scattering sunshine--most everywhere I go? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />By the way, generositas is central to the success of any relationship, especially marriage. In marriage, we give ourselves to each other. The quality of our giving contributes mightily to the value and quality of our marriages.&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe all of us are capable of showing greater generositas. What sparks us to be magnanimous especially when the stakes are high? Often during our college and university years, we can be self-absorbed, self-centered, and preoccupied with ourselves. This is especially true when we play sports or compete in athletic events.&nbsp;<br /><br />The story that follows really struck and touched me. It centers on two, highly competitive women's softball teams, Western Oregon University and Central Washington University. These teams were competing for a Division II Championship. Imagine in your mind's eye the following scene, Sarah Tucholsky of Western is a bat. She is small in stature and is at best, a below-average hitter, having achieved only 3 hits in 34 at bats for that season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The first pitch arrives. It is a strike. Doing everything she can to silence the crowd noise and ignore a few avid hecklers in the park, she takes the next pitch. She knocks it out of the park. However, as Sarah begins her home-run jog, she misses first base. As she attempts to return to first base, she incurs an ACL tear and is unable to complete her trip around the bases on her own. Her pain is significant.&nbsp;<br /><br />Her first-base coach and teammate, Shannon Prochaska, queries the umpires to see what she and others can do. Could Sarah crawl back to first base on her own? Her coach, Pam Knox, contemplates sending in a substitute runner and having Sarah's hit counted as a single, not as a home run. Then something remarkable happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Pam Knox, Sarah's coach, hears these words: "Excuse me, would it be OK if we carried her around and she touched each bag?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup><sup>21</sup></sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the voice of Mallory Holtman, a fierce competitor and very talented softball player for Central Washington University. Together with Liz Wallace, her teammate, they carry Sarah around the bases for her one and only home run of her life. You can imagine the response of all who witnessed this momentous act of generosity first hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />In her own words, Mallory captures so much about what it means to evidence a generosity of spirit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Honestly, it's one of those things that I hope anyone would do...&nbsp; She hit the ball over her fence. She's a senior; it's her last year...&nbsp; I don't know, it's just one of those things I guess that maybe because compared to everyone on the field at the time, I had been playing longer and [I] knew we could touch her, it was my idea first. But I think anyone who knew that we could touch her would have offered to do it, just because it's the right thing to do. She was obviously in agony.<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn22" target="_self">22</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>We also can look for spontaneous opportunities to touch, to lift, and to carry. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />I conclude my remarks with one last tender account of what it means to demonstrate a generosity of spirit. This account centers on a little, four-year-old girl, who for more than two decades was temporarily named "Baby Hope." No one knew her name. She was never reported as missing. She was, however, brutally abused and murdered by a relative. With persistence on the part of the New York Police Cold Case Division, we now know her real name, Anjelica Castillo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Two years after [Anjelica] was found, [she] was laid to rest in a donated plot, buried in a white dress bought by a detective's wife, with a tombstone paid for by detectives. "Because we care" is the inscription at the bottom of the tombstone . . .<sup><sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn23" target="_self">23</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>We really can care for others. We can touch others by showing a generosity of spirit. It can happen in grand or small ways. You too can be an Ammon, a Bowe, a Shallenberger, a Carol, a Lee, a Spencer, a Vaughn, a Mallory, a Liz, a white dress giver, or a caring police detective.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can make a difference in the lives of others by scattering sunshine--His sunshine. Our Father in Heaven wants us to be instruments in his hands<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_05_Egan.htm#_edn24" target="_self"><sup><sup>24</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;by being worthy of and responsive to the Spirit. Our Father in Heaven is counting on us to mirror His generosity and that of His son. I know that you and I can be more generous. We can manifest a generosity of spirit in all we do. As we sing the closing hymn, I hope we will willingly and cheerfully "scatter sunshine," remembering that our slightest actions often meet the sorest needs. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

He married Shelley Hatch in May 1979. They are the parents of five children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear students, as much as Sister Nash and I admire President Clark, we are particularly excited to be with you!<br /><br />Joseph of the Old Testament prophesied of the Prophet Joseph Smith in these words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins...and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word...for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation...and out of weakness he shall be made strong.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn1" target="_self">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This last phrase must have comforted Joseph Smith, for although he was strong of body, mind, and character, he was weak by almost every other earthly measure.&nbsp; As I share with you stories and facts about the Prophet Joseph Smith, please keep in mind the phrase--"out of weakness he shall be made strong"--and consider three questions: How can weakness lead to strength?&nbsp; How was Joseph Smith made strong out of weakness?&nbsp; And, what does this mean for me?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As a boy, Joseph longed for forgiveness of his sins, but could not determine which church was true, and could satisfy his yearning.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>He wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">though my feelings were deep and often poignant...it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Joseph recognized that he lacked the ability to determine the true church on his own.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; Fully aware of this weakness, needing wisdom that he did not have, he read and pondered the Bible. After reading James 1:5, he went into the grove to ask God which of all the churches was His--and not just to make a journal entry on the subject! He inquired so that he could&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;something about it, so that he could&nbsp;<em>join</em>&nbsp;that church.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;In response to his humble, sincere prayer made with real intent, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph, forgave his sins, and, as he came to realize, opened the door for the Restoration.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later, the Lord told him: "...I [have] raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;Joseph did not dispute that he was one of the "weak things of the earth;" he in fact described himself as "an obscure boy...who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;Joseph was born into a low social stratum, with limited formal education, and raised in a family that scratched out a living from the land in rural New York. His first attempt at writing his history highlights some weakness. Let's read together--in his own handwriting dating to 1832--Joseph's description of his youth:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was born in the town of Charon in the State of Vermont North America on the twenty third day of December AD 1805 of goodly Parents who spared no pains to instructing me in the Christian religion. At the age of about ten years my Father Joseph Smith Seignior moved to Palmyra Ontario County in the State of New York and being in indigent circumstances were obliged to labour hard for the support of a large Family having nine chilldren and as it required their exertions of all that were able to render any assistance for the support of the Family therefore we were deprived of the bennifit of an education suffice it to say I was mearly instructtid in reading writing and the ground rules of Arithmatic.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a></sup></p>
<p>When I read Joseph's own handwriting, I can almost hear him speaking. As much as I enjoy that, I am not sure that he would have received high marks from an English teacher on either his composition or his spelling.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;Joseph couldn't even spell the town of his own birth correctly. The proper spelling is "S-H-A-R-O-N."&nbsp;<br /><br />Given his limited education, it is remarkable that he was given the immense task of restoring the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness, which required that he translate a large book of scripture (the Book of Mormon)--nearly 600 pages as originally published. This Joseph did in less than ninety days; and in those ninety days Joseph also had to sleep, eat, seek employment, endure persecution, receive the Aaronic and then the Melchizedek Priesthood, receive several revelations now included in the Doctrine and Covenants, travel, and secure the copyright for publication of the Book of Mormon. Any thinking person would conclude it to be impossible for the educationally weak Joseph to have accomplished such a thing, and the explanations fabricated by critics are much more far-fetched than the true explanation: He translated by the gift and power of God.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Emma, Joseph's wife, gave an interview late in her life in which she said that, at the time he translated the golden plates,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph Smith...could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter; let alone dictating a book like the Book of Mormon. And, though I was an active participant in the scenes that transpired, it is marvelous to me, "a marvel and a wonder," as much so as to anyone else.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn11" target="_self">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Against the backdrop of this history, please look at page one of Joseph's first journal, dated November 27, 1832. Remember, this was written approximately three years and five months&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;he had concluded the translation of the Book of Mormon. You will note that he writes, and then strikes-out, the following words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph Smith Jrs Record Book Baught for to note all the minute circumstances that comes under my observation<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn12" target="_self">12</a></sup></p>
<p>As I have held this diary and read these crossed-out words, I have imagined Joseph penning the opening sentence, and then thinking: "No, that's not quite right, let me try again." So, he strikes out the sentence, and writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Joseph Smith Jrs Book for Record Baught on the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of November 1832 for the purpose to keep a minute acount of all things that come under my observation etc.- -<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn13" target="_self">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, probably not entirely satisfied with the stilted, halting language he had just penned, he writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">oh may God grant that I may be directed in all my thoughts Oh bless thy Servent Amen.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn14" target="_self">14</a></sup></p>
<p>With these words written as a prayer, Joseph--who is struggling to write a sentence--acknowledges his inadequacy, his weakness, and pleads for God's help!&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, compare the above journal entry written in November 1832 with a copy of an original manuscript page of the Book of Mormon, transcribed more than three years before (sometime between late May and early June 1829).&nbsp;<br /><br />As we look at this together, please note the flowing prose, without punctuation, without strikeouts. This was not a composition. This was dictated, word by word, as he looked into instruments the Lord prepared for him, using a hat at times to shield his eyes from extraneous light in order to plainly see the words as they appeared. Contrary to one who translates with the use of a dictionary, as it were, the translation was revelation flowing to him from heaven, and written by scribes (with the inevitable scrivener errors). As you can see, there is a vast difference between the translation of the Book of Mormon and the journal entry: one is the product of Joseph the Prophet, Seer and Revelator working by the gift and power of God, and the other (his journal) was a product of Joseph Smith, the man.&nbsp;<br /><br />This passage must have comforted him as he translated it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn15" target="_self">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Joseph learned that the promise of heaven's help extends even to the small details.&nbsp; For example, Joseph, a poor speller, corrected the scribe's (who was Oliver Cowdery) first spelling of the name "Coriantumr." The first time it was dictated,<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn16" target="_self">16</a>&nbsp;</sup>we find in the original transcript that Oliver spelled the word "Coriantummer." This was reasonable for an English speaker, since there are no English words that end in "mr." However, Joseph--who was a weak enough speller to accept the spelling the Lord gave to him, corrected Oliver's spelling in the same line (that is, during the translation), so that it reads as it now appears in the Book of Mormon. We now know that while the "mr" ending is poor spelling in English, it is perfectly good Egyptian spelling and fits well into the Old World setting. Most readers of the Book of Mormon--then and now--do not know this, nor would Joseph have known this but for revelation.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>Joseph was not a mythical hero who lived above it all. No, he experienced the challenges, personal weakness, and vicissitudes associated with mortality, including what he called "foolish errors" in his youth.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp; Years later, as an adult, he told the saints in Nauvoo that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He was but a man and they must not expect him to be perfect; if they expected perfection from him, he should expect it from them, but if they would bear with his infirmities and the infirmities of the brethren, he would likewise bear with their infirmities.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn19" target="_self">19</a></sup></p>
<p>In short, Joseph never pretended to be perfect or infallible, yet boldly acknowledged:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I speak as a man it is Joseph only that speaks. But when the Lord speaks through me, it is no longer Joseph Smith who speaks; but it is God, and let all Israel hear.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph faced times of uncertainty and loneliness just as we all do. In those times, he found comfort and sustaining perspective through prayer. In Liberty Jail, he cried out: "Oh God, where art thou?" and the response he received is so profound it has been canonized.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;During a time in Kirtland when he was abandoned by many (including his own brother William), Joseph pleaded with God to help them. Daniel Tyler was present at one such prayer and describes it in these words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I had heard men and women pray...from the most ignorant, both as to letters and intellect, to the most learned and eloquent, but never until then had I heard a man address his Maker as though He was present listening as a kind father would listen to the sorrows of a dutiful child. Joseph was at that time unlearned, but that prayer...partook of the learning and eloquence of heaven. There was no ostentation, no raising of the voice as by enthusiasm, but a plain conversational tone, as a man would address a present friend. It appeared to me as though, in case the veil were taken away, I could see the Lord standing facing His humblest of servants I had ever seen. Whether this was really the case I cannot say; but one thing I can say. It was the crowning, so to speak, of all the prayers I ever heard.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn22" target="_self">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Prayer is woven throughout the tapestry of Joseph's life.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is striking that much of Joseph's work was accomplished in roughly the age span we see represented here today! He received the First Vision when 14 years old, the visitation from Moroni at age 17, completed the translation of the Book of Mormon and organized the Church at age 24. To state the obvious, it was impossible for Joseph to have done all this by his own ability. It was only accomplished because he was strengthened and magnified by the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, to the first question I posed: "How can weakness lead to strength?" There is a divine purpose in weakness:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn23" target="_self">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Although it seems counterintuitive, weakness is given to help us become strong in the only way that matters in time and eternity: that is, through the Savior and His Atonement. The Savior's grace--His enabling power--will flow to us only to the degree we are humble before Him and exercise faith in Him. Our humility before the Lord, then, is an essential catalyst for the strength and power of God to be manifest in our lives now and forever. If we hold to that humility and exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, He will make us strong. The Savior is the great example of the humility and faith required of us: in the premortal life, in Gethsemane, and as a resurrected being, He does the will of the Father.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn24" target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp; If we wish for the Lord to make us strong out of our weakness, we can do no less.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My second question posed at the outset was: How was Joseph made strong out of weakness? As we have seen, Joseph (throughout his life) felt acutely of his weakness. He humbled himself before the Lord, and sought in faith for the Lord's guidance and enabling power. He did so through the best means available--both then and now: thoughtful study of the scriptures, heartfelt prayer, and willing obedience to the Lord's will, commandments, and ordinances. By living day-in and day-out in this way and making it the pattern for his life, Joseph Smith was made strong far beyond the desire and aspiration of his youth to simply be clean before the Lord. Indeed, he became the prophet who did "more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of man, than any other that lived in it."<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn25" target="_self">25</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The third and final question is "What does this all mean for me?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;To state the obvious, we all have weakness. Fortunately, we are agents unto ourselves, permitted and enabled by divine design to act and not be acted upon.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn27" target="_self"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;We can choose to be defined by our weakness, to be conquered by it, or we can choose to be motivated by it to humbly seek the Master's guidance and grace, His enabling power. This, then, is the potential virtue of weakness: if, by our choice, weakness moves us to humble ourselves before the Savior and to exercise our faith in Him, then by His Atonement we can become strong. So, let's not "excuse ourselves in the least point because of [our] sins" or weakness.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn28" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp; Rather, let us, like the Prophet Joseph, choose to recognize our weakness, humble ourselves before the Lord, and exercise our faith in Him through thoughtful study of the scriptures, heartfelt prayer, and willing obedience to the Lord. The better we get at consistently living in this manner, the more we shall, out of weakness, be made strong.&nbsp;<br /><br />I recently received an email from a young man I know and love who has humbled himself before the Lord and exercised his faith to be obedient to His will.&nbsp; With his permission, I share a portion of his letter. As I read this, see if you can detect the very principles I have mentioned today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Years and years of trying to overcome my challenges, only to be beaten down again had taken its toll on me, mentally, spiritually and even physically...I had tried everything to get over my problems. It wasn't as simple as repenting anymore, it was an addiction...I knew I needed God's help, but sometimes felt forsaken in my depressed state...I heeded as best I could your counsels and inspired words...It took more faith [and humility] than I have ever mustered before in my life. Faith in God and the Atonement and earnest prayer...And so I tried, I took it a half a day at a time. Then a day at a time, and so on - And now I am here in the MTC about to serve a mission for the Lord.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn29" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I wish he had never touched the unclean thing,<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn30" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;I am profoundly grateful for our Savior who has all power in heaven and earth to miraculously cleanse, strengthen, heal, and make my friend--and you and me--whole.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn31" target="_self"><sup>31</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup>This promise of healing and strength is extended to all who are humble before the Savior and exercise faith in Him. We who humble ourselves will, sooner or later, join with Ammon in exclaiming: "I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn32" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Importantly, the Prophet Joseph&nbsp;<em>grew</em>&nbsp;in strength; he was not made mighty in a moment. It came to him, and can come to each of us, line upon line, here a little, there a little.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn33" target="_self"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;So, as you consider how far you have to go, do not be discouraged; as my friend described in his email, the process is gradual and will require our steadfast humility and faith to follow the Savior and abide by His will. Be encouraged by the history of Joseph Smith, Prophet, Seer, and Revelator--and remember the Lord calls upon the weak things of the earth--like you and me--to do His work.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn34" target="_self">34</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Humility means that we hold to our faith without dictating a timetable to the Lord, something the Prophet learned through hard experience--think Liberty Jail, think Kirtland. When Peter walked on water, then doubted and feared, and began to sink, the Savior caught him immediately, and gently chided: "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn35" target="_self"><sup>35</sup></a>&nbsp;I believe the Savior was telling Peter: "I know that the storm is raging and that people do not walk on water. Yet, you were doing so--so why did you doubt?" If your faith is attacked or, like Peter's, seems to be wavering, remember what you know: that your faith has enlarged your soul, enlightened your understanding, and has been delicious to you--and that what you have felt is light, goodness, and is everlastingly real.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn36" target="_self"><sup>36</sup></a>&nbsp; So, as the Lord invited Peter, remember what you know, hold to your faith, continue to learn, and He will strengthen you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now--although serious sin can be avoided--you will nonetheless sin and make mistakes. For example, when Joseph transgressed the commandment of God to safeguard the 116 manuscript pages of the translation of the Book of Mormon, he was rebuked for fearing man more than God.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn37" target="_self"><sup>37</sup></a>&nbsp; He repented, was "called again to the work,"&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn38" target="_self"><sup>38</sup></a>&nbsp;and carefully protected the manuscript thereafter. Joseph was reminded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You should have been faithful; and [the Lord] would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn39" target="_self">39</a></sup></p>
<p>So it is with us. When we err or sin, repent, the Lord will extend His arm and support to us to the extent that we put our trust in Him.&nbsp;Let me share a story to illustrate. Several years ago, I was hiking in the North Central Cascades of Washington with our oldest son Jonathan. It was night, and we came to a part of the trail that bordered a steep cliff on the edge of an abyss. At that point, Jonathan (who was 10 or 12 years old at the time) became fearful and dared not go on. I urged him forward, but he refused. I then took him by the hand, and with the other hand on his shoulder, I said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jonathan, I am your dad; I will not let you fall. I will grip your hand and take two steps. You then will take two steps, and together we will cross this section of the trail.</p>
<p>Slowly, gradually, we crossed that portion of the trail because I had him by the hand and he trusted me as his dad. Similarly, each of us may--if we humble ourselves before the Master and exercise our faith in Him--figuratively take Him who has all power in Heaven and earth by the hand. And, with the "matchless power"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn40" target="_self"><sup>40</sup></a>&nbsp;of God flowing to us, we cannot, we will not, fall or fail.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn41" target="_self"><sup>41</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Just before he and Joseph left for Carthage, Hyrum read aloud to Joseph from the very Book of Mormon you see pictured and then folded the page shown which reads in part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn42" target="_self"><sup>42</sup></a>I am confident that Joseph and Hyrum took comfort at that unsettled time in knowing that&nbsp;<em>because</em>&nbsp;they had seen their weakness and been faithful to the Lord, they would be made strong in eternity. Such is the promise to all who see their weakness and turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart.</p>
<p>One final story: William Tyndale, who translated the Bible into the language of the common person--English--in the sixteenth century--and was martyred for it--stated to a cleric who opposed his efforts: "If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough, shall know more of the Scripture than thou dost!"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn43" target="_self"><sup>43</sup></a>&nbsp;In a parallel some three hundred years later, Nancy Towle, a famous itinerant preacher in the 1830s, visited Kirtland. While there, she sharply criticized the Church. The emotional Sidney Rigdon responded in kind, and accused her of being "in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity!" According to Towle's record, Joseph said nothing during this heated exchange until she turned to him and demanded that he swear to her that he had seen an angel. Ever gregarious, Joseph good-naturedly replied to her that "he never swore at all." Having failed to rattle him, she tried to belittle him: "Are you not ashamed, of such pretenses?" she rejoined. "You, who are no more, than an ignorant, plough-boy of our land?" Joseph calmly responded: "the gift has returned back again, as in former times, to illiterate fishermen."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn44" target="_self"><sup>44</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph compared himself to an "illiterate fisherman." In this, Tyndale's words were prescient: certainly a plough-boy did grow to know more of scripture than that cleric, and probably more than any man that ever lived, save the Savior only.&nbsp; As he reflected upon his life, Joseph Smith must have personally identified with Jacob's observation that&nbsp;The Lord showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men that we have power to do these things.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn45" target="_self"><sup>45</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith was and is a Prophet of God, made strong out of weakness. The man who could not even spell the name of the city of his birth was enabled to translate the Book of Mormon, which is everlastingly, powerfully true. Rather than have heartburn over the fact that Joseph was a human being, I am awe-inspired by what the Lord made of him and am encouraged by it to believe that the Lord can make something even of weak me. Those who knew him best were not put off by Joseph's humanness: said Brigham Young: "I feel like shouting hallelujah all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn46" target="_self"><sup>46</sup></a>&nbsp;Although we do not enjoy that blessing in mortality, I take solace in the poetic promise that "millions shall know Brother Joseph again."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn47" target="_self"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My how we love you, dear students! You were sent to the earth in this day and age to contribute to hastening of the work of salvation with the strength of God. You have come with your unique bundle of talent and weakness--and with just enough weakness to make you strong in the Lord if you so choose. My three-part invitation: (1) develop your talent with gratitude for Him who gave it to you; (2) humbly acknowledge your weakness before Him; and (3) steadfastly exercise your faith in Him, seeking His guidance and strength through thoughtful study of the scriptures, heartfelt prayer, and willing obedience to the Lord's commandments and ordinances. As we have seen, in this way, Joseph was--despite all that the world and hell could throw against him--made mighty by the power of the Almighty. And, in this same way, you too will be made strong and succeed beyond your brightest, grandest dreams.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Heavenly Father lives. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is "the only true and living Church upon the face of the whole earth,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_11_12_Nash.htm#_edn48" target="_self"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;restored to give those desirous and willing full access to the Lord's Atonement. President Monson is a prophet of God. The Savior lives, and His Atoning sacrifice offers the bright, shining hope of strength out of weakness, of forgiveness, healing, and good things to come for those who humbly seek and exercise their faith in Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>One morning several weeks ago, I was driving to school and looked toward the sunrise. I saw the BYU-I campus and the Rexburg temple and thought about the many changes that had occurred since I began to teach here. I reflected on the lessons I had learned through my life that helped me through these changes. The thought came to me, "write this down for your devotional talk." I was alarmed, even a little shaken. I reacted by reprimanding myself for even thinking about being considered to give a devotional talk. Then the thought came to me, perhaps this was not my idea and I needed to prepare.<br /><br />A few weeks later, I was humbled when I received the invitation to speak in devotional. The Lord is always out in front of us preparing the way. I pray that the Spirit will be here and teach you the things which may be helpful for you to learn from these experiences.Change - it happens. Change shapes not only this university but even us as individuals. Perhaps you experienced change when you came to school and had new roommates, classes, time schedules, assignments, tests, and church callings. It has been said there is nothing so constant as change itself. Many of us tend to think of change as an enemy. However, change offers opportunities to let us grow.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me illustrate this by sharing a story. Rulan, my husband, loves working with plants. In fact, my father said Rulan not only had a green thumb, he also had green fingers because plants thrive under his care. Now there have been plants in our home that I thought were growing beautifully, but Rulan noticed they had stopped growing. They had become root bound because the pot they were growing in was not large enough. He would take the plant to the washroom sink and shake it out of the small pot. Then he would loosen and sometimes snip apart the tightly bound roots. The plant would then be placed into a larger pot, and have fresh soil packed around it. Next, Rulan would prune the top portion so it would have a good shape and give it a drink of water.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am sure the plant hurt a little at being disrupted from its familiar environment. At first, you couldn't see the effect of the change but soon the plant would take new life and grow again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, change is usually not easy for us but can provide opportunities for personal growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unlike the plant, the new situations you are in often require you to make a decision on how to respond to the change. Your daily decisions will lead to the most important change of all, the change within yourselves. Elder Oaks taught us: "The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to change.... The purpose of the gospel is to transform common creatures into celestial citizens, and that requires change."&nbsp;<br /><br />The first lesson I would like to share with you is the importance of choosing to act and not react to change. To illustrate this principle I would like to share a story about my grandmother. For President Gordon B. Hinckley taught, "It is good to look to the past togain appreciation for the present and perspective for the future."&nbsp;<br /><br />Lettie, a fun-loving and talented girl, grew up in Bluff, Utah during the late 1800's. Since she had a strong desire to learn and loved music, she saved her money and went to Brigham Young Academy. A journal entry indicates one morning she went to devotional and saw "an earnest, clean looking young man" who had recently returned from his mission. To make a long story short - she married this young man in 1902 and together they began a new life in a small town in southeastern Colorado.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />James and Lettie bought a rubber-tired buggy soon after they got married. Lettie felt confident driving the horse drawn buggy and enjoyed taking the children on outings. However, the early 1900's was a period of great change in the transportation industry. The Model-T Ford was new on the market and began replacing the buggies as a means of transportation. When James bought a Model T, Lettie was cautious about learning how to drive it but gradually gained confidence.&nbsp;<br /><br />One day, she decided to visit her husband in the fields and loaded the children in the back seat of the car and started off. All went well until she came to the ditch. Automatically she reacted by shouting out Whoa, pulled back on the steering wheel, and pushed her foot down - on the gas pedal. They jumped the ditch. The children bounced high and yelled out in delight but Lettie was shaken. It was not quite what she was expecting. Fortunately no one was hurt.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many times our natural response to change is to react based on our past experiences. This can lead to bumpy transitions. Sometimes when I am faced with change and things do not go very smoothly I think about Lettie, my grandmother, and how she must have felt as she tried to learn how to drive the Model-T Ford. She may have wondered why she needed to learn how to drive a car because she was very proficient at driving the buggy. If only she could see the transportation we have now.&nbsp;<br /><br />What can you do when change threatens to unsettle you? What actions can you take to help you make the right decisions? The story of Lehi and his family leaving Jerusalem teaches us the importance of being teachable and humbly turning to the Lord in prayer.When Lehi took his family into the wilderness, his sons did not fully understand why they were leaving Jerusalem. Laman and Lemuel chose to react to the change. We read in 1 Nephi chapter 2 verse 12:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And thus Laman and Lemuel being the eldest, did murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.</p>
<p>Compare Laman and Lemuel's reaction to Nephi's action. It must have been equally as hard for Nephi to leave all the familiar things in Jerusalem and travel in the desert. What did he choose to do? In verse 16 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that I Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, where, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</p>
<p>Instead of murmuring about the situation and creating conflict, Nephi had a desire to gain a better understanding. He prayed, his heart was softened, and then he was teachable.&nbsp;<br /><br />How many times do we react to situations when we rely on our own understanding? How easy is it for us to be taught by the Spirit when we have fear or when conflicts in our hearts arise? Elder Scott taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The inspiring influence of the Holy Spirit can be overcome or masked by strong emotions, such as anger, hate, passion, fear, or pride. When such influences are present, it is like trying to savor the delicate flavor of a grape while eating a jalape&ntilde;o pepper. Both flavors are present, but one completely overpowers the other. In like manner, strong emotions overcome the delicate promptings of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>There have been times when I have felt conflict in my heart and the accompanying burning of the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. I have needed to turn to the Lord in prayer and ask for my heart to be softened. The answers to my prayers did not always come immediately. But when they did, my heart was softened and it was sweet to have the pain of the jalapeno pepper removed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lesson 2 - Hold fast to that which is good.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Scott counseled with us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Father in Heaven knew that you would face challenges and be required to make some decisions that would be beyond your own ability to decide correctly. In His plan of happiness, He included a provision for you to receive help with such challenges and decisions during your mortal life.</p>
<p>There are unchanging principles that will help guide us through change. To illustrate the blessings of holding fast to that which is good by having secure anchors, I would like to share some experiences from my father's life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff Johnson was born in 1921 and grew up during the depression. Although his family did not have much in the way of money, he was richly taught by his parents how to securely anchor his life.&nbsp;<br /><br />During the early 1940's World War II was raging across Europe when Clifton Johnson, my father, joined the Army. Prior to leaving for boot camp he was given a blessing and was told others would have as their purpose the destruction of his ideals. Cliff was promised if he would be humble, courageous, and kept himself morally and spiritually clean that those who were inclined to ridicule and oppress him would be rebuked and many of them would come to look to him for leadership and advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />At the train station his mother told him "Son, remember, praying will keep you from sinning and sinning will keep you from praying. Always remember to pray." The first night in the barracks, after the lights were turned out, Cliff knelt down by his bunk and began to say his nightly prayer. Immediately others in the room began to mock and ridicule him. The next night he had a decision to make. He could yield to the pressure and avoid mockery by just climbing into his bunk, or he could pray. He decided to pray. Eventually those who ridiculed him apologized and, realizing the battles they would soon face, asked him to say a pray for them too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff had the opportunity to go to officer candidate school, OCS. He described the experience as tough. Many dropped out of the program; and with two weeks left, there were only 42 left out of a class of 100. His tack officer, a tall imposing man, thought my father looked too young and inexperienced to lead others. He called my father to his office and said, "Candidate Johnson, this is the GROUND forces where they need men to lead men. You're appearance is decidedly against you. I've got some suggestions for you. Oklahoma City isn't far away, neither is Dallas, Texas. Why don't you go out and drink a little, smoke a little, find yourself some girlfriends? Then if you've aged a little, I'll consider that GOLD BAR on your shoulders for second lieutenant."&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff told the officer if that's what it took to get a commission, he didn't want it. He turned around and left the office without saluting. Cliff was kicked out of OCS and sent to a heavy artillery outfit that had orders to go prepare to go overseas into battle. Cliff was with the outfit as they passed their final field tests, and then he was called back into OCS where he completed his training.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before Cliff went overseas the colonel in charge of his unit called him into the office. He said, "Lieutenant Johnson, I see by your record that you are a Mormon. Is that right?" Cliff answered, "Yes sir." The Colonel continued "I had a Mormon boy with me over in North Africa and through Europe, a Captain Glen Cassidy. I wonder whether you knew him." Cliff said, "Yes sir, I knew him well, I went with him through school. He was a mighty fine person." The Colonel responded, "You don't need to tell me about him. He was the best officer I ever had serve under me, period."&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff was chosen over thirty other officers to accompany the Colonel based on the decisions made by another person to hold fast to that which is good. Likewise, decisions you make influence not only yourself, but others around you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff experienced the ugliness of war and was in several battles, including the Battle of the Bulge, the largest land battle of the war that raged from mid December 1944 through the end of January 1945. At the end of the war General John Francis Uncles, a three star general, came to inspect the outfit Cliff was in. Cliff was chosen to show the General and his staff around the camp. Afterward, General Uncles asked Cliff to be his Aide-de-camp, a position where he would assist the general in his responsibilities. Cliff responded, "Sir, I need you to know I am a Mormon, so I don't drink or smoke." The general responded, "I know that, but the job is still yours if you care to have it."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff was promoted to the rank of Captain and was again experiencing change as he went from the battlefront to the general's staff. Can you imagine how the new Captain Johnson must have felt when another officer began to make fun of him because he didn't drink and smoke in the presence of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a five star general and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe? What happened next would be forever etched into my father's memory. General Eisenhower rebuked the officer who had been ridiculing Cliff. General Eisenhower demanded, "You stop that for Captain Johnson! I smoke, and I wish I didn't! And I don't want you making fun at him."&nbsp;<br /><br />One of General Uncles' responsibilities was to inspect the military establishments across Europe. Among the officers at one of the establishments was the tack officer who had kicked Cliff out of OCS. By this time Cliff outranked the lieutenant. When the general gave the outfit a showdown inspection, the tack officer looked up to Cliff and respected him. The promises given in the blessing before he entered boot camp were fulfilled. Those who would have as their purpose to destroy his ideals would be rebuked and later would come to respect him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lesson 3 - Study and ponder the scriptures.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Hales taught us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For when we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures; for His words are spoken through His prophets. He will then teach us as we listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When Cliff returned to Salt Lake City, he was granted a scholarship to go to Harvard. Shortly thereafter, Cliff's bishop came to visit one day and asked Cliff if he would go on a mission for the church. Another change in life. Cliff wrestled with the decision because he was now 26 years old. He wanted to finish his education, get married, and have a family. He wondered if all those things would happen if he went on a mission. Cliff turned to the scriptures to help him make the decision. He read in Matthew chapter 6 verse 33, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."&nbsp;<br /><br />Cliff chose to change his plans and went on a mission to Maine. He had many wonderful experiences with the people there. After he came home from his mission he met my mother, got married, and was blessed with six children. He received all the things his heart desired.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have felt the blessings of the scriptures in my life. I have turned to them in times of change seeking to know what to do. Sometimes the answers were immediate. Most times they helped calm my heart. I would encourage you to daily study, ponder, and even memorize scriptures to help guide you.&nbsp;<br /><br />These have been some of the important lessons I have learned to help guide me through change. Now, there may be times you don't understand why there are so many challenges with the changes in life. The road of progression leads along an uphill journey. Sometimes it may feel steep. There may be mocking blows of adversity and personal battles to overcome. I will be forever grateful for the examples and stories of others who taught me how to respond to change for the guiding principles remain constant. They can be secure anchors in your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />This week many of us are preparing for the Thanksgiving holiday. We often search for fun centerpiece ideas, take time to plan out menus, go grocery shopping, invite guests, clean houses, and prepare food. Then comes the time for the great feast. There is joy when we gather to take time for feasting and gratitude.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your opportunity for an education here can be compared to a great feast. The ongoing planning and preparation for this feast has stretched the faculty beyond their natural abilities. I have been inspired by many of the faculty, both on campus and those teaching online, who have sought for guidance and inspiration on how to improve the quality of the education and lower the costs. Long hours of sacrifice have been given to help you students, many of whom they will never meet, prepare to become disciple leaders in a changing world. Sometimes the transitions can be a little bumpy, but we are on a steady upward tract. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I would invite you to learn by participating in this great feast. Embrace the opportunities here at school. Don't be content with just nibbling or consuming the leftover crumbs. That will not adequately prepare you. But rather, work hard in your studies to nourish your minds and spirits. We are counseled in Doctrine and Covenant section 88 verse 118 to "seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, change will come to each of us. We can become experts at and embracers of change. Be grateful for opportunities to become better. To avoid being shaken, remember to act and not react, turn to the Lord in prayer, hold fast to that which is good, and work diligently.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord is out in front of us preparing the way. His promises are sure. Your Father in Heaven is aware of your desires and loves you. I pray with all the energy of my heart that when you experience unsettling change, you will turn to Him and seek guidance and strength. He will guide you and sustain you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>In late August of this year, I was returning home from an evening of meetings, listening to a devotional given at BYUI, during my 30 minutes of drive time. As I was listening, the thought came to me: that is quite the responsibility to speak at a BYUI devotional. I thought of all the devotionals President and Sister Clark have given and I could not fathom how they do it. I said to myself, I am so grateful that I will never be asked to give a devotional address at BYUI. To my surprise, it was the very next day that Sister Beattie called and asked if I would be a devotional speaker. I won't reiterate my initial conversation with Sister Beattie but let it suffice to say my thoughts were:&nbsp; no, not me; I have nothing to offer or anything profound to say. Then I was reminded or taught or retaught that it is the spirit that teaches and he will teach what the "one" needs to know. I have learned that if you have come wanting to understand, wanting and willing to know what the Lord would have you learn, then you "shall be directed by the Spirit" and "ye shall become instructed in the law . . . and be sanctified by that which ye (shall) receive."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; I am humbled by this assignment but know that if your heart is prepared the Holy Ghost, in a much customized way, will tell you what the Lord would have you know and do.&nbsp; It is of an understanding heart that I which to speak of today.<br /><br />Approximately 2,160 years ago, a prophet of the Lord boldly stood before a king and his priests.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And they began to question him, that they might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him; but he answered them boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to their astonishment; for he did withstand them in all their questions, and did confound them in all their words. And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers . . .<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn2" target="_self">2</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>To which Abinadi replied:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you priests, and pretend to teach this people, and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean? I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the Lord! For if ye understand these things ye have not taught them; therefore ye have perverted the ways of the Lord. Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise.<sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn3" target="_self">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the principle Abinadi was attempting to teach King Noah and his priests is as applicable today as it was 2100 years ago. I submit that Abinadi was teaching us that it is not enough to understand the doctrines and commandments and teachings of the Lord in our minds but that we must also apply our heart to our understanding. It is not enough to get it here (pointing to my mind) but we must get it deep within our hearts (pointing to my heart). I submit that Noah and his priests had been taught by goodly parents the doctrines, principles and commandments of the Lord. And yet, they chose, as Abinadi reminded them, not to apply their hearts to their understanding. He reminded them that though they had an intellectual knowledge, they were not applying their hearts to their intellectual understanding.&nbsp;<br /><br />You who are attending BYUI probably know the gospel intellectually more so than any previous generations. Yet, gospel knowledge alone is not sufficient to be truly converted. President Eyring has stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The pure gospel of Jesus Christ&zwj; must go down into the hearts of young people by the power of the Holy Ghost. It will not be enough for them to have had a spiritual witness of the truth and to want good things later. It will not be enough for them to hope for some future cleansing and strengthening. Our aim must be for them to become truly converted to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ while they are young.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know if I were to ask anyone of you what are the Lord's standards or what does He expects of each of you in regards to worthiness, duty, etc., that you could quickly and easily recite them. A majority of you have been taught the Lord's standards, doctrines and principles from your youth. In fact, if I were to ask, many of you would say: President, you know, it is the seminary answers. But it is when we get our understanding deep within our hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost that we experience true conversion. And it is true conversion and not an intellectual conversion that drives our behavior.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share with you what I believe was a defining moment in one of my children's life. One evening I was in my room reading. My then 15 years, 11months and two week old daughter came and sat down at the end of my bed. She started the conversations this way.&nbsp; "Dad, John (his real name isn't John but for purposes of this address, we will call him John) has asked me to the homecoming dance."&nbsp; Now you have to understand that John was the quarterback of her high school football team and a star football player; someone who was popular at school. It was an invitation I am sure that she very much wanted to accept. What high school girl wouldn't be flattered by such an invitation?&nbsp; She continued:&nbsp; "I know that I am not 16 years old but would it be alright if I went to the dance with John?" You see she had asked me, I suppose, hoping that if I said it was alright, then it was my decision, and all would be square with her and the Lord. I remember looking at my daughter and saying something to this effect:&nbsp; "Holly, you know what counsel the prophets of the Lord have given, you are almost 16 years old and old enough to decide, so you decide and I will be alright with your decision." I will always remember her response: "That's not fair!" Well, my then 15 years 11 months and 2 week old daughter had to decide. Would she apply her heart to her understanding?&nbsp; Some might rightfully argue that it was only two weeks before she turned 16 and there would be no harm in going to the dance. And yet, that really, in my mind, is not the issue. The issue in my mind is are we really willing to submit as Elder Holland has taught our will to the will of the Lord, in advance, unconditionally, no matter the consequences? Well, my then 15 years, 11 months and two week old daughter chose to follow the counsel of the prophets and declined John's invitation to go to the dance. She is now 33 years old, married to a wonderful man with five children of her own. I believe that this moment in her life helped to drive what she knew intellectually deep within her heart. I know she has had other experiences in life where she has chosen to follow the Lord's teachings and that such experiences have helped her learn how to apply her heart to her understanding. Do you think that she knows how to teach her children how to apply their hearts to their understanding?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />True to the Faith teaches that "conversion is a process and not an event. You become converted as a result of your righteous efforts to follow the Savior." True conversion then is a result of exercising righteous behavior. And righteous behavior comes as we apply our hearts to our understanding. And as we apply our hearts to our understanding, our conversion will come as a result of our righteous efforts. As you continue to apply your hearts to your understanding day after day, week after week and month after month, the day will come when you will find yourself submitting your will to the Lord's will, in advance, unconditionally, no matter the consequences. I believe this is what the Lord was trying to teach Peter when he asked him not once, not twice, but three times:&nbsp; "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Remember, after the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection, that Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, James and John and two other disciples &nbsp;gathered together. The conversation probably went something like this: Well, what do we do now? And Peter's answer was: "I go a fishing." And those that were with him said "we also go with thee." So, they went fishing. And of course you know the rest of the story. They go fishing and as the scriptures record: "they caught nothing."&nbsp; "Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat?&nbsp; [And] they answered him, No."&nbsp; So the Savior instructs them to cast their "net on the right side of the ship" and in doing so, they catch so many fish "they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes".&nbsp; And then John turns to Peter and says: "It is the Lord." And Peter then realizing it was the Lord on the shore "girts his fisher's coat unto him and did cast himself into the sea."&nbsp; And there on the shore, the Lord had prepared a meal for them and when they had dined Jesus asked Peter "lovest thou me more than these?" And he didn't just ask him this question once but three times. And as Elder Holland reminded us, Peter was pretty sensitive to threes at that time in his life. Well, as Elder Holland has explained, the Savior was teaching Peter that he needed to get rid of the boat, jettison the oars, lose the nets and go about the work he had been called to do. He had told him once to leave his nets and follow him and was now making it clear to Peter that he was not to turn back but to go forward. He was teaching Peter if you like that he too needed to apply his heart to his understanding. It was after that experience that as Elder Holland has expounded that Peter became Peter the Great; that even his very shadow passing by them would heal the afflicted.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Harold B. Lee said: "The most important responsibility that we, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ have, is to see that we are converted to the truthfulness of the gospel."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp; When we have the gospel deep within our hearts, when we are converted to the truthfulness of the gospel, we do not question the Lord or play the why me game when life does not happen as we had planned such as when we don't get the job we wanted or the graduate program we applied for. A Christ centered disciple moves forward with an assurance that the Lord is mindful and so a Christ centered disciple moves forward with conviction, faith and trust in the Lord. A person who has the gospel rooted deep within his or her heart will find and have peace in the mist of seemingly unanswered prayers, trials and struggles. If we have the gospel deep within our hearts, we will be able to follow the counsel of President Monson and "meet our challenges with courage and our disappointments with cheerfulness."&nbsp;<br /><br />May I suggest a few ways that will help in your quest to become truly converted; that will help in planting what you intellectually know deep within your hearts?&nbsp;<br /><br />1. Be obedient! "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, at that moment, God will endow us with power."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;Obedience really is the first law of heaven. When you are obedient to the truths you know and the covenants you have made, the Spirit of the Lord can and will guide and direct you. The resurrected Lord in speaking to the Nephites said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have given you the law and the commandments of my Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Therefore, come unto me and be ye saved;<sup style="font-family: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: #666666; font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn8" target="_self">8</a>&nbsp;<br /><br /></sup>As you are obedient in doing the things which the Lord has asked you to do, even when it is not popular and especially when it is not popular, you will draw nearer to the Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Be humble. Be willing to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and change that which needs to be changed. Each one of us is perfectly aware of our favorite sin. "The most important of all the commandments of God is that one that you are having the most difficulty keeping today."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;Let us humbly acknowledge our weaknesses and give up that which keeps us from coming closer to the Savior. Did not the Lord say:&nbsp; "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />3.&nbsp;Be diligent in seeking the Lord. Accept President Eyring's plea "to do the simple things with determination that will move you forward spiritually."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;Be a prayerful and scripture loving person. Your spirit life will be no better than your pray and scripture life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And I said unto them [that] whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</p>
<p>What a great promise; a promise that as you find yourself consistently "feasting upon the words of Christ" you will never perish. Let us find ourselves speaking with our Heavenly Father on a daily and consistent basis. And "ye must pray always and not faint." As you speak daily with your Heavenly Father, you will indeed draw closer to him. You will be more likely to do that which you know you should do. You will be better able to judge between good and evil. Do not become casual in doing the simple things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casualness really does lead to casualties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />4.&nbsp;Listen to the Holy Spirit. "But behold there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; Wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;However, if you will not harden your hearts and if you will be obedient, humble and prayerful, feasting upon the words of Christ, then "the Holy Ghost will show unto you all things what ye should do for the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />5.&nbsp;Be temple focused.&nbsp; In the temple we make sacred covenants, the keeping of which will be a blessing and a protection to you. Be in the temple as often as your circumstances will allow. In the temple, you are reminded of who you are and of your purpose. You are reminded of the Lord's great love for you. You are taught how to apply your heart to your understanding. In the temple, we are reminded that when we follow the Savior with full purpose of heart, we are entitled to the guidance of the spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />6.&nbsp;Start today. President Harold B. Lee taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Conversion must mean more than just being a "card carrying" member of the church with a tithing receipt, a membership card, a temple recommend, etc. It means to overcome the tendencies to criticize and to strive continually to improve inward weaknesses and not merely the outward appearances.<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must as President Eyring has counseled: "have the goal not just in our minds but in our hearts." You don't need to wait until tomorrow. You can begin to apply your heart to your understanding today. Could I suggest that you go home today and ask the Lord-"help me understand what I must do to be better; what do I need to change; how can I apply my heart to my understanding?"&nbsp; I don't know what you need to do now, today, to apply your heart to your understanding. For each of us it will be different. But, if you will ask the Lord and if you are sincere and if you are willing to do that which is revealed to you by the Spirit of the Lord, He will tell you. You will then begin to reconcile your will to His will. You will then have a change of heart and you will follow his teachings and keep His commandments because you love Him and you will find yourself drawing nearer to Him. Get the gospel of Jesus Christ deep within your heart and not the world. You can choose today to follow the Savior with full purpose of heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />I reiterate President Eyring's plea to do the simple things with determination that will move you forward spiritually. I know that if you will follow the Savior as Nephi described with "full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins," that the teachings, principles and doctrines that will bring you "peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come,"<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_12_03_Simpson.htm#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;will take root deep within your hearts. Rather than just having an intellectual conversion you will be truly converted or in other words, you will experience a true conversion. You will find yourself as Abinadi counseled "applying your hearts to your understanding" and you "shall have wisdom, even great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures." I so testify In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, it is a delight to be here with you today! I ask for your faith and prayers as we consider a vitally important key to our happiness and success in this life and the eternities. I speak this afternoon about having or not having children. However, I do so in an effort to help us better understand life's tests and challenges and how we can pass those tests!&nbsp;<br /><br />I'd ask that you have a means of taking notes and that as you do so, you listen to and write down what the Holy Ghost specifically teaches you. As you write these sacred teachings down and respond to them, you will be profoundly blessed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently in the press, the USDA announced that it now costs about $241,000 to raise a child to age 18.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This doesn't even include a mission or college! We also see in the press, in popular TV sit coms, and in social media, the difficulties and challenges of raising children. With all this combined with the swiftly changing moral values of our day, some LDS young people are scared to death to raise children in such a wicked world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />While there's no doubt that raising children will be expensive, difficult, and at times exasperating, we also know that having a family is very important. The reason is that family binds us to something good. While family can bring us some of our greatest heartaches, it can also bring us our greatest joys, and a righteous family protects us from the influences of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most of you are single and you may be wondering how this applies to you. Most of you will be parents one day. However, even if you may never marry, may not have the opportunity to have children, or perhaps you're widowed or divorced, you still share in the responsibility to teach and train children.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />The document, The Family: A Proclamation to the World, provides a foundation to our understanding of the family. And I quote:&nbsp;"Family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We understand from this one sentence that God holds our family responsibilities as one of the most important things we can do in this life. Let's review four doctrines pertaining to our responsibility as parents.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Family Proclamation, it says: "The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What it doesn't say, however, is anything about timing, how many children; or how our physical, mental and emotional health might affect how we fulfill this doctrine. The reason Heavenly Father wants us to fulfill this commandment is so He can bless us with joy in our posterity throughout the eternities.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Proclamation continues: "Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny...Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children."<sup>4</sup>So we are under obligation to love and care for each of our children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Matthew teaches us that children are pure and we have a solemn duty to protect them.<sup>5</sup>Paul teaches that Heavenly Father is the father of our spirits and we are his offspring.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; The doctrine here is that they're not just OUR children, but they continue to be HIS children. When we view them as His and realize that we have the responsibility to teach and train them so they'll return to Him, we will treat our children differently. We'll take our responsibility more seriously.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, to quickly review these four doctrines:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let's talk about three of the duties we have under these doctrines. Again, from the Proclamation:<br /><br />"Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives--mothers and fathers--will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe we have a responsibility first to teach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has told us through Elder Richard G. Scott how to accomplish this task:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I'm sure you can identify the fundamental principles that center your home on the Savior. The prophetic counsel to have daily personal and family prayer, daily personal and family scripture study, and weekly family home evening are the essential, weight-bearing beams in the construction of a Christ-centered home. Without these regular practices it will be difficult to find the desired and much-needed peace and refuge from the world.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Our children should have vivid memories of us taking moments to openly teach them principles of the Gospel. They should be dressed in modest clothing from day one. We should discuss modesty when you shop for clothing, so they will have that as a core value. Our responsibility as parents is to teach these core values at home, because it can't be compensated for by teachers at church. However, the void will be filled by their peers.&nbsp;<br /><br />One thing I know is that when children are taught, they become so excited to demonstrate what they know. One child blurted out as his father was choking to death on his lunch at our family reunion, "It's okay, Dad!&nbsp; At school we learned the Heimlich Remover!"President Monson shares a story about a prisoner of war, a father, who taught some of life's greatest lessons in 25 words. And I quote:"In the 1960s, during the Vietnam War, Church member Jay Hess, an airman, was shot down over North Vietnam. For two years his family had no idea whether he was dead or alive. His captors in Hanoi eventually allowed him to write home but limited his message to less than 25 words. What would you and I say to our families if we were in the same situation--not having seen them for over two years and not knowing if we would ever see them again? Wanting to provide something his family could recognize as having come from him and also wanting to give them valuable counsel, Brother Hess wrote--and I quote: 'These things are important: temple marriage, mission, college.&nbsp; Press on, set goals, write history, take pictures twice a year.'"<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We don't have to be prisoners of war to teach these values, but perhaps you and I can learn from a prisoner of war what's really important for us to teach and what our priorities should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Number one, we are under a profound obligation to teach our children.Secondly, we need to respect and value them.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have vivid memories, and perhaps you do as well, of talking to a frustrated and angry mother or father, and hearing some of the most awful things about their children spew out of their mouth as their children stood inches away and listened with great intensity. Those tirades often ended with the feeling from the parent that they would be better off without that child.&nbsp;<br /><br />For good or for ill, what we say about our children will become seared on their minds and will color everything they aspire to, hold to, and become. The most believable messages you deliver to your children will be those you tell others about them, especially when your children are secretly listening! The moral of this story: Speak only positively about your children, both to their faces and to others--always! While you may need to discuss their frailties and challenges with your spouse or another trusted individual behind closed doors, this should be done in very limited fashion and only in essential situations. If you value them, show them. Tell them and make sure every word you speak communicates that they are valued!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As a parent, one of the most mortifying experiences is when we have a screaming child in the grocery store, making a scene and out of control, when we feel judged as a bad parent because of the child's behavior. At times like this, we tend to lose sight of the value of that child. It requires great patience. The LDS Guide to the Scriptures defines patience as:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Calm endurance; the ability to endure affliction, insult, or injury without complaint or retaliation."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Stop and translate that definition of patience into the grocery store incident. It's the ability to "endure affliction, insult, or injury"<sup>11&nbsp;</sup>without any complaint and without retaliating against the child. And why would a just God impose this type of trial even upon righteous parents? Because he understands that we'll need to have eternal patience if one-third of our children abandon all we hold dear, that we'll need to look upon our worlds and allow our children to make mistakes, even to eternal death, and continue to respect their agency. He knows that the best tutor for that kind of patience will be our own mortal children! It is at moments like this that we will be tested to our limits. However, if we allow it, our patience will grow to the point that we can calmly kneel down face to face with our screaming child, and in a kind and loving tone, explain that they need some time out and once they're done acting out, they can come out again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Children will defy us to respect them, at times in their life. It is only by seeing them through God's eyes, that we can look at them at those times and see someone worthy of our respect.&nbsp; However, once we develop that kind of response to our trials, we will become fit for Heaven!&nbsp;<br /><br />Number two, we have a responsibility to respect and value our children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thirdly, we need to love them:&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the Mormon Messages of yesteryear was "If ya love'em, tell'em!" But it takes much more then telling them, it takes showing them over, and over, and over again! Kids (and spouses, by the way), can never get that enough. How do you show them?<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When children have been prepared and feel loved, they sometimes respond the way our five year-old grandson did to his mom when the two of them sat up to the bar eating breakfast together. He looked up at his mom and said: "I get distracted from eating when I sit by you Mommy, because I love you so much!'&nbsp;<br /><br />The way we show we love them is to hug them and tell them. It's by making our homes a happy, safe, secure, fun, and welcoming place to be. It's done when we teach by our example how we talk about others, how we respond in a crisis, how we handle difficulty; by how we dress, speak, and conduct our lives. Love is shown by establishing consistency and constancy in the life of our children.<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to teach them, to respect and value them, and love them!&nbsp;<br /><br />Not everyone will fall into the church's optimal family situation. We have to address the optimal and desired doctrinal goal for us all, because that is still our goal. But, let's talk for a minute about those who, for various reasons may not be able to achieve that goal in this life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Proclamation also states that "Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />For those of us who are frightened to have children because you were beaten and abused, suffering at the hands of overwhelmed, over tired, untaught, and sometimes unrighteous parents, would you choose to draw a line in the sands of your life this day? It's now upon you to learn better patterns of behavior. You study and pray and find the grit to become for your children, all that you wanted in your parents! You can and must become the last generation in your family to ever abuse a child! This is your test!&nbsp;<br /><br />You can do this! Can you feel that? Heavenly Father wants you to be the pivot point, a power link in the lineage of your family where he can begin sending children into righteous loving homes. He will give you the insight and understanding to make this come true. He can change your heart from one of anger and mistrust, into one which loves others, values peace, and has learned to trust. If you truly believe in the Atonement, then you must also know and believe that His atoning sacrifice can change you!&nbsp;<br /><br />This is your challenge. It may be your biggest test in this life! I challenge you today to begin this journey. Look around you and observe other righteous examples of kindness, tenderness, patience and the ways of peace, and the Lord will cement in your heart a resolve to always choose that path! You may make mistakes along the way. Don't get discouraged. Just ask forgiveness of the Lord, your spouse and children and do better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our newly baptized grandson recently heard his parents talking with us about the mistakes we made as parents and he piped up, "Yeah, I've made thousands of mistakes and I'm not even a parent yet!" We will make mistakes. Just choose to improve and move on. "Learn your Duty, then act in all diligence" and he will bless you! I testify of that!&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's talk for a moment about those of us who may not be blessed to have children, whether it's because you may not marry, because of some physical limitation, or other reason. You have alternatives, so do what you can to find them in medical care, adoption, foster care, or by serving and loving other peoples' children. Don't give up hope! However, at some point, you will need to realize that this may be your test. Would you want instead, the difficult tests others struggle with? This is your test. While some have very visible tests, this is one you shelter deep within your heart and soul. You may even be unkindly judged because you don't have any outward signs of your struggle. You can either become bitter and hardened, resentful toward Heavenly Father and angry toward those who can have children, or, you may choose a higher path. If you choose light rather than shrinking into the darker path of anger, you will discover the light that brings joy amidst suffering! Light can bring joy--even amidst suffering!&nbsp;<br /><br />I have some friends who are about my age and who have never been able to have children. However, they have been able to turn their challenge into a life of service to the young people of their ward and extended family. What could have become a life filled with negatives, has become a life filled with children. Kids are over at their house after school for milk and cookies, the husband has built a zip line in the pasture for the neighbor kids to play on, and he installed a long rope on a tree at the river's edge so the kids can hold onto it and knee board as the river runs beneath them. Isn't that cool! They also have opportunities to teach the lessons of life that children often have a hard time taking from a parent. Life can still be good! And when some of those kids have their rotten days, you can send them home!&nbsp;<br /><br />As we all must, they have also learned one of life's great lessons as exemplified by the Savior:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor&nbsp;his people according to their infirmities.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>What my friends have learned is that countless times since they've suffered their test, they've been able to take on the infirmities of others, they have had opportunity to succor others in their trials. When we lift burdens and sorrows in that way and express mercy, we experience god-like emotions of compassion and love. By doing so, our suffering assumes meaning in our lives.&nbsp; When we find meaning in suffering, we are better able to bear our own burdens. I repeat--when we can find meaning in the difficult things in life--by serving others who are burdened--we will be better able to bear our own burdens. I love and admire them for their willingness to bear others burdens, even amidst their own trials!&nbsp;<br /><br />Hang on to this truth and pass this test, and recognize the great blessings you have. If someone asks if you have kids, don't feel judged, don't get depressed or angry, don't stay away from the very people who will love and support you through all of this! Just say something like, "we haven't been able to have children and now we're looking at alternatives, but life is still good!" and move on from there! Go on with confidence that all the blessings of marriage and family will be yours in the eternities. You cannot let this challenge break your spirit! If you do that, you risk breaking your relationship with Heavenly Father. Your challenge, your test, is to be patient and wait upon the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We lost a six-year-old daughter in a car accident many years ago. I was sitting in the chapel in the temple when it happened, and my wife, the brand new Young Women's president with four young children, and a two-month old baby, was headed to a Young Women's volleyball game. That was one of our tests.&nbsp; Now we wait anxiously for the resurrection. We all wait for something. Know that you're not alone in your grief and struggling! Just get to work in becoming the best you can be, "wait upon the Lord,"<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and have faith in the Lord's timing as you learn the things you need to learn.&nbsp;<br /><br />For those of us who are single parents, raise your children in the gospel. While your test isn't easy, it is within the realm of your abilities! You can do this and when life gets tough, you pray with all your might for Heavenly Father's help and he will bless you with strength. Just as with the people of Alma who served in bondage, He won't necessarily remove this burden from you, but he can make this burden sweet!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Can you imagine at times when you're too tired, too stressed, too filled with emotion to put one foot in front of the other, that he can help you find cheerfulness?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember what he says in Doctrine and Covenants 84:88:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There I will be also, for I will go before&nbsp;your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my spirit&nbsp;shall be in your hearts, and mine angels&nbsp;round about you, to bear you up.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>As you find patience with the Lord's timing and submit your heart to him, he can heal you and you can become a savior upon Mount Zion for yourself and your children. Your challenge today is to get on your knees, in the peace of your own bedroom each evening, and to express gratitude to Heavenly Father for all you do have. Pour out your heart, allow your tears to wash discouragement from your soul occasionally, and then listen to Him. Right amid your prayers, just stop talking and listen intently for what the Lord would teach you. Listen for several minutes. Have a paper and pencil handy to write those promptings down. He will teach you and you will find hope and joy in your difficult journey!&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, for all who will be parents. Would you please express appreciation daily for that gift that not all will enjoy? There will be days when your children will disobey, when they become angry and defiant, when you will wonder if being a parent is a gift and blessing, or a curse! Those days will be your test! However, as you lead and guide your children in righteousness, he will give you access to his "Guide to Child Rearing." You will experience at times, a nearness to the veil that will astound you as you look into the eyes of your children and realize who they really are!&nbsp; The day will come when your children shall arise up and call their parents blessed.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And now a word of warning about the gravity of our obligation from the Proclamation on the Family:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Parenting has been among my most difficult tests! However, it's also been amazingly rewarding! I will make you a promise this day, that whatever your circumstances in this life relative to having children--whether you will have them or not--if you will find God in your heart and submit it to him, understand that this is your test in this life, he will heal you and bless you to be able to bear the burdens you have.&nbsp;<br /><br />I promise you that when you face your test with courage and righteousness, the Lord will bless you to respond as did young David, when mocked and taunted by the massive Goliath:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />May we approach our tests with the faith of young David to commit this moment never to allow the darkness of our day to defeat us. We can face our difficulties with courage and strength!&nbsp; Earth is a School! This is part of our final exam! While nobody has exactly the same test, we can learn from and gain courage from others! May he bless us to pass this test with flying colors!&nbsp; May we leave here today and approach our test with tenacity. We must not let our tests derail, depress or discourage us from being an affirmative force for good in the Lord's work!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that if He can give sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and bring back life to those who have died, he can breathe peace into our hearts! I &nbsp;pray that we may teach His children with diligence, respect and value them, and love them and that we may pass our tests in this life with glory! This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I express my admiration and love to each of you who have worked hard to get where you are today and to those behind the scenes who have encouraged, supported, and sacrificed for you. I know President Clark personally and have heard him speak of you often with great love and an earnest desire for your success. I hope you have eyes to see with great gratitude the efforts of family, friends, faculty and administration who have selflessly supported you to be where you are today. They have been and will surely continue to be gifts of love to you. One of my favorite Christmas songs is one entitled &ldquo;The Best Gift.&rdquo; I would suspect that for some of you, this graduation day is one of the best gifts you&rsquo;ve ever had at Christmas time. Congratulations on this magnificent moment in your life!</p>
<p>Because several of our beloved former missionaries are scattered among you today, I have been reflecting back on cherished moments together in the mission field. Many of you have had those experiences. One came every six weeks and was repeated 27 times during our mission. It was the &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; testimony meeting for the departing missionaries. During one memorable such meeting Elder Kesler stood and declared &ndash; &ldquo;Oh I get it&hellip;my MISSION was the REAL MTC for my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have approached this graduation day, some of you may have had a similar thought. You may have realized that the education you received here on this inspired campus is not an end, but a beginning. Others of you, however, may have felt that with your cap and gown on and a diploma nearly in your hands, you are finished once and for all with finals. But I assure you this has only been a preparatory final for the final &ldquo;final&rdquo; that lies ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can spend a great deal of time, energy and effort in this life pursuing things of little value if we don&rsquo;t know what matters most. Life is so uncertain. In the past few years, we have lost 3 loved ones who were the ages of some of you here &ndash; a 20 year-old niece and 2 nephews, ages 24 and 34. Only the Lord knows when our mortal journey will come to an end. So it is imperative to give highest priority and fix our focus on things of eternal significance. The scriptures remind us that if we are prepared we will not fear.<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I always appreciated professors who did their best to prepare us for finals by clearly outlining expectations at the beginning of each semester and then systematically teaching us the related concepts. If I knew what was expected, I knew where to put my best efforts as I prepared for each final. Consequently, I tended to do better in those classes where expectations were clear. Similarly, if you knew what the Lord was going to ask you to account for at the judgment bar, wouldn&rsquo;t you focus your greatest efforts the on those areas?</p>
<p>We were recently given three of the areas of accountability that will be required of us at that final &ldquo;final&rdquo; by one of the 15 men we sustain as a prophets, seers, and revelators. Elder Russell M. Nelson taught that we will account for the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>decisions that we made about our bodies</strong></p>
<p><strong>decisions we made about our spiritual attributes</strong></p>
<p><strong>how we honored God&rsquo;s pattern for marriage and family</strong><a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>Those three things are what I would like to speak about for the next few minutes. I hope these things will be worthy of your focused attention as you begin the rest of your life today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. We ARE accountABLE for decisions WE MAKE about our bodies</strong></p>
<p>Of all God&rsquo;s creations, one of the greatest is the physical body created to house the spirit of the sons and daughters of God. Our bodies are a gift from God. How we regard and care for these splendid gifts, the temples of our spirits, matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bednar shared a significant observation recently with regard to our bodies. He then gave us a warning to help us as we make eternal decisions about the use of our body and these God-given gifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because a physical body is so central to the Father&rsquo;s plan of happiness and our spiritual development, Lucifer seeks to frustrate our progression by tempting us to use our bodies improperly. One of the ultimate ironies of eternity is that the adversary, who is miserable precisely because he has no physical body, entices us to share in his misery through the improper use of our bodies. The very tool he does not have is thus the primary target of his attempts to lure us to spiritual destruction.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband is a stake president in one of the young single adult stakes in Salt Lake City. He deals on a regular basis with the heartache and regret that accompany abusing the body by violating the law of chastity and the Word of Wisdom &ndash; both designed to protect our bodies and our spirits. I plead with you to pay attention to Elder Bednar&rsquo;s words of warning. If you do so, you will bless not only your life, but the lives of those who you love on this side of the veil and those whose spirits are waiting to come to earth as your future mortal sons and daughters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. We ARE accountaBLE for decisions we make about our spiritual attributes</strong></p>
<p>One of President Monson&rsquo;s favorite poems highlights one of the spiritual attributes needed by all of us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have wept in the night at my shortness of sight</em></p>
<p><em>That to other&rsquo;s need made me blind</em></p>
<p><em>But I never have yet had a twinge of regret</em></p>
<p><em>For being a little too kind.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></em></p>
<p><em><strong><br /></strong></em></p>
<p>Kindness is one of the essential spiritual attributes we each need to acquire in this life. In our efforts to obtain spiritual attributes, we should expect that significant sacrifices will be required of us. Just as you have made great sacrifices and have been required to pay tuition to obtain your intellectual education, your quest to become like the Savior in acquiring the spiritual attributes that He has, also has a cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Jesus&rsquo; day, he was approached by a lawyer who asked &ldquo;Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;What followed was one of the most memorable parables the Savior taught.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus then paused and asked the poignant question, &ldquo;Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he [the lawyer who had asked the question that prompted the parable] said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go and do thou likewise.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago, President Monson read a letter sent to the First Presidency telling about a couple of church members who served as good Samaritans to a man in need who was just passing through Salt Lake City. In his hurry to flee a bad situation in Boston, he had forgotten his necessary medication and found himself sick and trembling from loss of sleep and his lack of his much-needed medication. In part the letter read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&rdquo;In the&hellip;hotel restaurant, I sat dejectedly&hellip;Out of the corner of my eye I saw a couple approach my table. &lsquo;Are you all right, young man?&rsquo; the woman asked. I raised up, crying and a bit shaken, and related my story and the predicament I was in then. They listened carefully and patiently to my nearly incoherent ramblings, and then took charge&hellip;They spoke with the restaurant manager, then told me I could have all I wanted to eat there for five days. Then they drove me to a clinic and saw that I was provided with the medications I needed &ndash; truly my basic lifeline to sanity and comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;On my last day at the hotel, before I resumed my journey, I turned in my key; and there was a message for me from that couple: &lsquo;Repay us by showing gentle kindness to some other troubled soul along your road.&rsquo; That was my habit, but I determined to be more keenly on the lookout for someone who needed a lift in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter closed with the following words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if these are indeed the &lsquo;latter-days&rsquo; spoken of in the scriptures, but I do know that two members of your Church were saints to me in my desperate hours of need. I just thought you might like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we, like this couple of modern-day good Samaritans, be willing to make the needed sacrifices in order to become more like the Savior &ndash; filled with spiritual attributes such as kindness and selflessness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. We ARE accountAble for how we honor God&rsquo;s pattern for marriage and family</strong></p>
<p>What is HIS pattern? We find God&rsquo;s pattern for marriage and the family in the inspired document &ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World.&rdquo; When this proclamation was read by President Gordon B. Hinckley in a General Relief Society Meeting in 1995, the world was different than it is today. Because the Lord sees all things as they were, are and will be, He revealed this sacred document to define His pattern for marriage. This pattern serves as a guide for us as we make our way along the covenant path amidst those who ridicule, mock and seek to distract us as they jeeringly point fingers of scorn at us from the great and spacious building. I invite you to memorize this sacred document, &ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World.&rdquo; As you do, I promise that God&rsquo;s pattern for marriage and family will be planted deep in your hearts. We have been told by a prophet, seer and revelator that we will be asked to account for how we honored God&rsquo;s pattern for marriage and family. First we need to <strong><em>know </em></strong>the pattern in order to honor it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the many phrases I love in this inspired proclamation says, &ldquo;Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other&hellip;&rdquo; This, too, often requires sacrifice, kindness and selflessness on our part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who are not married or who are without families, this means preparing to become worthy spouses and loving fathers and mothers. In some cases these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal and promised blessings are the same for all providing covenants have been faithfully kept.<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Christmas is just around the corner, I&rsquo;d like to share with you the essence of one of my favorite Christmas stories that illustrates the beautiful phrase in the proclamation about loving and caring for each other as husband and wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are familiar with this story. It tells of a young married couple who dearly love each other. Like many of you, they are living on next to nothing and find themselves the day before Christmas with very little money to buy gifts for each other. Because of their love for each other, they sacrifice their most prized possessions in order to buy gifts of love for each other. She sells her beautiful long hair to purchase a chain for his pocket watch &ndash; the only worldly possession of worth that he owns. Unfortunately, he sells his pocket watch to buy some decorative combs for her beautiful long hair &ndash; which she has cut too short to hold the beautiful combs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O. Henry, the author concludes the story by saying, &ldquo;The Magi, as you know, were wise men &ndash; wonderfully wise men &ndash; who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful story of two foolish children in an apartment who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days, let it be said that of all who give gifts, these two were the wisest, for theirs were the gifts of love.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, as you consider what matters most from this day forward, may you determine to accept full accountability for your bodies, your spiritual gifts and how you honor God&rsquo;s pattern for marriage and family. May the use of the gift of your agency to guard these be among your best gifts of love to your Father in Heaven and our Savior Jesus Christ this season and always. After all, it has been insightfully observed that &ldquo;What we are is God&rsquo;s gift to us. What we become is our gift to God.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again I congratulate you on this happy day of your lives! Thank you for allowing me to share in this joyful and significant milestone with you. My prayer is that you will pass the final &ldquo;final&rdquo;&hellip;the only one that REALLY counts, with flying colors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave you with my testimony that the Lord speaks to His servants today to reveal His will because He loves us. His &ldquo;best gift&rdquo; was the gift of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ whose &ldquo;best gift&rdquo; to us was His Atoning sacrifice. May we live so as to be worthy of these very &ldquo;best gifts&rdquo; is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It is such an honor for me to be invited to share a few remarks with you graduates. This is a wonderful season of the year for many reasons. It is wonderful for all of you because you are graduating. It is wonderful because we all take time to reflect on the birth, ministry, and mission of the Savior and all He has done for us. It is wonderful this year for me personally because the season has provided opportunities for deep reflection. One of the many things I have thought about is my experience with BYU-Idaho and the transitions and changes that have occurred for this remarkable institution over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have reflected on many of the great people who have been part of the process &ndash; some who are still involved and some who are no longer with us, like President Gordon B. Hinckley and President James E. Faust. I have had particularly tender thoughts about President Faust and so developed remarks to share with you on this occasion based on a few of the many insights I learned from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important for you to know that President Faust was an attorney by education and training and also that he grew up in rural Utah. Many of the images and metaphors he shared were about things he had observed in nature while growing up or about different aspects of the legal profession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those of us who work around Church headquarters spend a lot of time in meetings &ndash; making presentations, seeking direction, and asking for approvals. From President Faust&rsquo;s legal background, he kindly reminded us on occasion that when in these meetings, it was better to have a friend in court than a thousand friends out in the courtyard. He truly was a friend of CES and of BYU-Idaho. As a member of the First Presidency and one of the Officers of the Board of Trustees, he occupied a unique position in helping guide this institution as it transitioned from Ricks College into BYU-Idaho more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another lesson came while President Faust was supervising the work of one of the Church departments. He was instrumental in guiding the preparation of a presentation that was to be shared with the senior brethren. Based on his involvement in developing the presentation, the managing director of the department asked whether President Faust would also like to participate in making the presentation. Because he was a member of the presiding council that would make a decision based on the presentation, President Faust smiled warmly and said, &ldquo;No. When we are in that setting [where this presentation needs to be made], I will be flying with a different flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using that image from President Faust, I would like to expand on the idea; the concept of flying together in flocks has piqued my interest and has caused me to be more observant of the interaction of different species of birds as they fly. I have tried to learn a little more and think about these interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know that when geese are flying long distances, they group together and fly in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation. The purpose of this is many-fold: (1) the synergy of working together as a group creates greater strength for the flock than the sum of the strength that each goose would have individually &ndash; the &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation actually creates a 50% energy savings that allows the whole flock to increase its flying range by 71%, (2) the geese support each other by honking at one another (referred to as contact calls) whenever one falters or gets out of formation, and also for encouragement to the one on lead, (3) the leadership role is rotated so the lead goose does not have to feel the constant drag and wind resistance by being in the front all the time, and (4) every bird in the formation can see where the flock is going so they can work together to get there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many parallels from that image that could apply to all of us as members of families, as members of the Church, and as members of a community. Here are a few for thought: as we move through life, we need to learn to work together so we can be as efficient and productive as possible; working in councils and with teams helps increase our capacity to do more than we could accomplish individually; we need to sustain, support, and encourage each other in our efforts; when it is our turn to fill a leadership role, we should take our turn and not shirk in our responsibilities. But we cannot (or should not) always be out front, we need to learn to be supportive followers as well; and we always need to keep our eye on our long-term goal of eternal life and work together so we all arrive there safely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have been fascinated in watching flocks of small birds, such as some species of starlings or different varieties of sandpipers. Rather than flying in some distinct formation, or in an obvious orderly pattern, large numbers of these birds fly together in what are seemingly unorganized swarms. Doing so actually serves multiple purposes. Some researchers have suggested reasons including things such as socialization, facilitating the finding of food, and most importantly, for protection against predators. Many eyes can see much more and warn the others of any approaching dangers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In watching these large flocks of small birds, there appears to be some invisible radar associated with each bird &ndash; when one makes the slightest change in its direction, the entire swarm shifts and they all move harmoniously, avoiding mid-air collisions. These birds are responding to a phenomenon called &ldquo;maneuver waves.&rdquo; The energy created within the flock caused by individual movements allows each bird to act independently while anticipating changes in the group dynamic at a rate much faster than their individual reaction time would account for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional phenomenon has been observed with maneuver waves: as long as the movement brings the birds together or towards a valued goal, they all respond. If a single bird ventures to fly outside of the safety net provided by the flock, exposing itself and the others to potential danger, the rest of the flock resists following in that direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, there are corollaries that are useful for us to consider. Change is inevitable &ndash; anticipate it and move with it. Because of your education, hopefully, you are much more intellectually agile and will be able to adjust with changing times. As you do, perhaps you will appreciate this quote attributed to Eric Hoffer, a working-class American philosopher. He wrote, &ldquo;In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.&rdquo; You have learned how to learn, so make life-long learning an important aspect of your life. Also, if the flock you are flying with is moving towards worthwhile goals and objectives, there is safety in numbers; however, don&rsquo;t be afraid to fly alone, if necessary. If some bird you are flying with exposes you to danger or tries to get you to move outside of the safety net of the gospel, resist it &ndash; don&rsquo;t go in that direction. As Edward Sanford Martin once wrote, &ldquo;When 40 million people believe in a dumb idea, it&rsquo;s still a dumb idea.&rdquo; Christ said, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life,&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;&ldquo;Come, follow me&rdquo;.<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;Always stay safely on the Lord&rsquo;s side and you will remain safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my wife and I were married thirty-eight years ago, we each wanted to give the other a token gift that expressed our aspirations and devotion for one another &ndash; a token to help us focus on what was important and to remain safe. We independently selected the same quote &ndash; a familiar Quaker proverb: &ldquo;Thee lift me and I&rsquo;ll lift thee, and together we will ascend.&rdquo; As we all fly along through life (and life seems to fly by faster as you become older), may we look forward and ascend together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you graduate from BYU-Idaho, you will now move on and begin flying with a different flock, but you will always be counted among the wonderful alumni of this institution. You also will be part of a very elite group. Not only are you among a very small percentage of people in the world who have been able to graduate with a college degree, but you also have had the privilege of attending one of the Church-sponsored universities. As you leave here and fly away to various destinations, remember some of the lessons of nature: don&rsquo;t forget the safety that comes in staying connected to your flock; draw strength from one another, lift and encourage one another, share the load with one another, and keep your eyes on the ultimate goal of salvation and exaltation; don&rsquo;t venture outside of the safety net that the Lord has created in order to help you fly safely home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that God will be with you as you &ldquo;draw near unto [Him].&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I offer a few remarks to the graduates, I would like to say a word to the&nbsp;parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for entrusting your children to us. We love them very much. As I look at you today, I think of all the prayers you have offered on behalf of your children. I think of all the home evenings and family dinners. I think of all the times you sat up waiting for them to come home. I think of your devotion to them and your love for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to tell you something about your children. The light of the Spirit is in their eyes, and the love of the Savior is in their hearts. These are priceless, spiritual gifts. Your children have worked hard at BYU-Idaho. They have qualified for the blessings of increased faith, testimony, knowledge, and skills that will be of great value to them and their families and to the kingdom of God. They have become disciples of Jesus Christ. The Lord will send your children on His errands in a world in turmoil, and He and His Spirit and His holy angels will go with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I speak to the graduates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I love you very much. I want to share with you something that happened to me that I hope will be helpful to you as you go forward tonight on your life&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a recent morning I was studying the scriptures, reflecting on the blessings of the Lord in my life. In that moment a thought came into my mind: you are where you are and what you are, to an important extent, because of your parents. Your parents loved the Lord, served Him with great faith and devotion, and loved you and sacrificed much for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your father taught you how to work hard, how to sacrifice for your family, and how to be a good home teacher. He taught you what it means to be a priesthood man, to have both the authority and the power of the priesthood in your service as a father, as a husband, and as a trusted servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your mother taught you how to do your best and how to cultivate your talents to serve others. She taught you how to put your whole soul into serving the Lord. She taught you how to lead with love and compassion and sacrifice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your mother and father raised you in light and truth. They taught you how to create an eternal family and build the kingdom of God. It is a precious legacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I sat there pondering that message from the Lord, I felt overwhelming gratitude and love for my parents, and for Sue&rsquo;s parents whose influence on her has been just as profound. I pray that we will have that same kind of influence on our children and our grandchildren. We are creating an eternal family, and we are building the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is my hope for Sue and me, and it is my hope for you. No matter what your experience has been, I want each of you to resolve today, right now, in this very moment, that you will act with faith in Christ to do everything in your power, use every bit of energy and talent and courage that the Lord may give you, all the days of your life, to raise up your children in light and truth, create an eternal family, and build up the kingdom of God. I know that sooner or later all of you will have that privilege, and I know that the Lord will bless you and magnify you in that effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The days ahead will be full of wonderful opportunities for you and also great challenges. There is all around us now, and there will be all around us in the days ahead, diabolical shafts in the whirlwind,<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;cunning devices,<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;lying craftiness,<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; subtle deception,<sup><a href="#_edn4" target="_self">4</a>&nbsp;</sup>flattery,<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;doctrines of devils, [and] commandments of men.<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;These are all designed to tempt you, deceive you, turn you away from Christ, and destroy you and your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I give you this promise: if you act on the resolve to raise your children in light and truth, create an eternal family, and build up the kingdom of God, great and marvelous blessings will flow into your life. You will put Jesus Christ and His kingdom at the center of your life. You will make and keep sacred covenants in the temple of the Lord. You will seek and receive revelation about your family and everything else in your life. You will obey and serve the Lord, and He will be on your right hand and on your left, and His Spirit will be in your heart, and His angels will be round about you to bear you up.<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;You will be happy at home, secure in your covenants, and protected by the almighty power of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so I say to you tonight, go forward unafraid with confidence and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. I know He lives. I know He loves you and has called you to a great work in your eternal family and in His kingdom. His promises are true.</p>
<p>I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
