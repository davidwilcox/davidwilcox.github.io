<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a few days we will witness 
		the dedication and opening of the Rexburg Temple.&nbsp; The temple is 
		glorious! &nbsp;It will be a great blessing to us all.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Rexburg Temple comes at a 
		marvelous time, but also at a time of commotion and darkness.&nbsp; Brothers 
		and sisters, we live in a time of war.&nbsp; There are wars and rumors of 
		wars in many nations.&nbsp; The wars of men are fought with terrible 
		instruments of destruction, and they bring devastation and heartache and 
		death.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But there is another war, a 
		larger even more destructive war all around us.&nbsp; I speak of the Great 
		Warthe war that began in pre-mortality and continues on earth, the war 
		between good and evil, the war for the hearts and souls of men.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The Great War is a 
		central part of the testing and refining experience of mortal life.&nbsp; It 
		is a </span><font color="#000080">spiritual war in which there can be 
		much anxiety and worry, much suffering and pain, much despair and fear.&nbsp; 
		I know that some of you are worried about what might come, and some of 
		you are struggling even now in the battles of the Great War.&nbsp; </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In another time, in another 
		war, the Army of Helaman faced a terrible enemy.&nbsp; The young warriors 
		felt fear come upon them, but Helaman testified that the Lord </font><span style="color: #000080">did 
		speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did 
		cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</span><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">1</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I stand before you today as a 
		witness that these promises of the Lord are our promises.&nbsp; What the Army 
		of Helaman felt in a time of great peril, we may know and feel in our 
		spiritual battles today.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I bear witness to you that 
		the temple on the hill is a great symbol of those promises.&nbsp; It is the 
		Lord moving in great strength to speak peace to our souls, to grant unto 
		us great faith, and to deliver us through heavenly power.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My message today comes in two 
		parts. &nbsp;I want to talk first about the nature of the Great War and then 
		about the temple as a marvelous source of strength and power in the 
		battles we face.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us so that you 
		might hear today a voice of warning, a voice of promise and invitation, 
		a voice of hope and strength.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The theater of the Great War

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Where the Enemys purpose is

		power of the Atonement of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, we might be 
		redeemed, know joy and happiness, and return home to Him.&nbsp; As King 
		Benjamin proclaimed:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">This is the focus of 
		the Great WarSatan desires to have power over you, to seal you his in 
		darkness and misery and woe.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus Christ desires to redeem

		seal you His in eternal liberty and light, joy, and happiness.&nbsp; </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Although the Enemy has a

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #000080">The Individual 
		Battles of the Great War</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The answer to that 
		question depends on us.&nbsp; We fight the individual battles of the Great 
		War over the desires of our hearts.&nbsp; As we look for insight and 
		understanding and strength in our struggles, there is no better source 
		than the life of the Savior and the battles He fought.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Following His baptism, Jesus

		where He fasted for forty days and was tempted of the devil.&nbsp; The 
		scriptures record three of Satans efforts to tempt Christ with appeals 
		to appetite, pride, and greed.&nbsp; In each case, the Savior cut through the 
		lies and the sophistry and rejected the temptation.&nbsp; In majesty and 
		power Jesus dismissed the Enemy: Get thee hence, Satan: for it is 
		written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou 
		serve.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">President David O.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Nearly every temptation that comes to you and to 
		me comes in one of those forms.&nbsp; Classify them, and you will find that 
		under one of those three, nearly every given temptation that makes you 
		and me &quot;spotted,&quot; ever so little as it may be, comes to us as: (1) a 
		temptation of the appetite; (2) a yielding to the pride and fashion and 
		vanity of those alienated from the things of God; or (3) a gratifying of 
		the passion or a desire for the riches of the world or power among men.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">9</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The temptations of 
		appetite, pride, and greed are with us today.&nbsp; We see the temptations of 
		appetite at work in the evils of pornography, violations of the law of 
		chastity, alcohol, illegal drugs, gambling, thrill seeking, an excessive 
		desire for leisure, and a fixation on video games and other activities 
		that addict us or distract us from doing what is right.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">We see the temptations 
		of pride at work in attitudes of entitlement and selfishness, in 
		societys appeals to vanity and competition with one another, in 
		feelings of self-satisfaction, in scorn and ridicule, in anger and abuse 
		and violence.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">We see the temptations 
		of greed at work in societys fascination with wealth, in the desire for 
		gain without honest labor, in the desire for the honors of men, and in 
		the postponement of marriage and children for money and career success.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #000080">The Strategies of 
		the Enemy</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These temptations and many 
		others are the battles of the Great War.&nbsp; Oh, how I pray that each one 
		of us will follow the Savior and cut through the mists of darkness with 
		those powerful words: Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou 
		shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">10</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">These battles are 
		real.&nbsp; The Enemy is clever and resourceful and tries to attack us with 
		many different strategies.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Sometimes he uses <b>
		deception</b>.&nbsp; He is the father of lies and a master of disguise and 
		camouflage.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At other times he <b>attacks 
		directly</b> by raging in the hearts of conspiring men</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">11</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		and stirring them up to anger against that which is good.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">12</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">And there are times 
		when the Enemy simply tries to <b>distract</b> us, to lull us into 
		complacency, or to get us so caught up in the comings and goings of 
		mortal life that we lose our focus on the things of eternity.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The strategies of the 
		Enemy to deceive, attack, and distract are made even more effective if 
		he can <b>divide</b> us from one another.&nbsp; Division comes in many 
		formscontention, disunity, gossip, backbiting.&nbsp; But perhaps the most 
		insidious is silence.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The principle of 
		silence, or the code of silence, in the face of evil has been the 
		foundation of secret combinations and the works of darkness since Cain 
		murdered Abel.&nbsp; Please turn with me to Moses, chapter 5, verse 29:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">And Satan said unto Cain: Swear unto me by thy 
		throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die; and swear thy brethren by 
		their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not; for if they 
		tell it, they shall surely die; and this that thy father may not know 
		it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">13</font></span></span></p>

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Wherever we find 
		secret combinations, we find the code of silence.&nbsp; But silence has also 
		become part of the culture of society.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior taught us about 
		silence in the parable of the Good Samaritan.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">14</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		&nbsp;When the priest and the Levite came upon a wounded man by the side of 
		the road, they were silent.&nbsp; They took no action to help, nor did they 
		tell anyone of the man in trouble.&nbsp; The Samaritan, in contrast, spoke in 
		word and deed.&nbsp; He bandaged the mans wounds and took him to an inn.&nbsp; 
		The Samaritan told the innkeeper about the wounded man and arranged for 
		his care.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The man by the road 
		represents so many of our brothers and sisters, so many of us wounded by 
		the perils of mortal life and the battles of the Great War.&nbsp; And yet, in 
		our modern society, the Enemy has spread fear of getting involved when 
		someone is in trouble and has fostered a social stigma that attaches to 
		people who speak up in the face of evil.&nbsp; The Enemy whispers, Dont get 
		involved; its not your problem.&nbsp; Dont tell; you will be a tattletale.
		</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Here is an example: a 
		lonely, confused young man gets addicted to pornography by first 
		starting with the wrong movies and then edging into material that is 
		increasingly sleazy, vile, and immoral.&nbsp; He stops going to church, and 
		there is darkness in his eyes.&nbsp; The young man is spiritually wounded on 
		the battlefield of the Great War.&nbsp; His roommates know.&nbsp; But they are 
		silent.&nbsp; They do nothing to help him, and they say nothing to him or to 
		anyone else as he descends into an earthly hell until he is bound in the 
		chains of awful addiction.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Oh, brothers and sisters, 
		dont leave the wounded on the battlefield! &nbsp;Stick together.&nbsp; You dont 
		need to be a more righteous-than-thou person.&nbsp; We are all sinners.&nbsp; We 
		all have troubles.&nbsp; We have all been wounded spiritually.&nbsp; But you who 
		have felt the redeeming power of Christ, you who know His love and His 
		grace, you know He can heal all wounds.&nbsp; If you reach out in a spirit of 
		love and humility, you can help the spiritually wounded find the 
		Savior.&nbsp; If you need to, call for the medics: talk to your bishop, call 
		the Dean of Students, tell someone who can do something that you have a 
		friend in trouble.&nbsp; Dont be silent.&nbsp; Dont leave the wounded on the 
		battlefield! </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we speak of temple

		Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Today I will highlight three kinds of blessings and three 
		sources of power we receive in the temple: knowledge, sacred covenants 
		and promises, and the blessing of an eternal family.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Knowledge</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The temple is a house of 
		learning, especially about the plan of salvation.&nbsp; We learn many 
		wonderful things in the temple about our Heavenly Father, about His Only 
		Begotten Son, about the plan of redemption, and about our divine nature 
		and destiny.&nbsp; We learn about our purpose here on earth, about the Great 
		War, and about what we must do to return home to our Father.&nbsp; In this 
		sacred knowledge there is power against the deception, the attacks, and 
		the distractions of the Enemy.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to this formal 
		instruction, temple ordinances like baptism for the dead, the endowment, 
		and temple marriage contain symbols and patterns with great potential 
		for new understanding and knowledge, no matter how often we have been in 
		the temple.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Because of these symbols and 
		patterns, the Spirit may teach us many things that are very personal and 
		specific to our needs.&nbsp; We may see in the temple patterns to take with 
		us and apply in our lives.&nbsp; We may come to know the Lord more fully.&nbsp; In 
		the temple, therefore, we receive a fulfillment of the promise of the 
		Lord when He said:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Covenants and Promises</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the temple we take upon 
		ourselves sacred obligations of obedience, virtue, and dedication that 
		bind us to the Lord.&nbsp; There is great power in those personal covenants.&nbsp; 
		When they are written in our hearts, they become our deepest desires and 
		our most precious and sacred commitments. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we face the wiles of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These covenants also come

		order to receive those promises.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The temple is the place on

		House the ordinance of sealing binds us to our eternal companion and to

		one more welding link in the great chain of the generations, one more 
		thread in the tapestry of heaven.&nbsp; This marvelous sealing power brings 
		the blessing of living here on earth in an eternal family.&nbsp; We enjoy a 
		legacy of faith and righteousness that flows to us from our forebears,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well done! That simple saying 
		summarizes beautifully the pursuit of excellence, which I would like to 
		speak about today. Many of you probably recall the wonderful talk Elder 
		Dallin H. Oaks gave at the last general conference</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">1</font></span><font color="#000080">. 
		He spoke about good, better, and best, too, but his comments revolved 
		around the quality of activities we choose to give our time to. My 
		thoughts today will use this same phrase to consider the <i>quality of 
		our output</i> as we strive to excel. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you ever stopped to 
		consider that the pursuit of excellence is a principle of the gospel of 
		Jesus Christ? It should even be a <i>defining characteristic</i> of 
		members of His church.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder J. Richard Clarke has 
		counseled and encouraged us to accept the challenge to set a Mormon 
		standard of quality, unique <i>because of its excellence</i>.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Today, I would like to reiterate that challenge and offer a few 
		suggestions of how you wonderful students here at one of the Lords 
		universities can accomplish this goal.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Hinckley believes 
		that striving for excellence is a God-given directive:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The mind of man is the 
		crowning creation of God, in whose express image man was made. The 
		development of the mind is <i>a companion responsibility</i> to the 
		cultivation of the Spirit, <i>as set forth in the revealed principles of 
		the restored gospel of Jesus Christ</i>.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And, in case that was 
		unclear, he later rephrased that thought and got right to the point:
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Dont be a scrub! Rise to 
		the high ground of spiritual, mental, and physical excellence. You can 
		do it. You may not be a genius. You may be lacking in some skill. But so 
		many of us can do better than we are doing now. . . Dont muff your 
		opportunities. Be excellent.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">4</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Be excellent</b>! But what 
		does excellence mean, exactly? To excel means to go beyond a limit. 
		I never really enjoyed, or even understood, calculus, but I know that 
		going beyond a limit sounds really hard! College basketball coach, 
		Rick Pitino, said that excellence is the unlimited ability to improve 
		the quality of what you have to offer. Is it possible to improve 
		infinitely? Well, right there is the Plan of Salvation, isnt it? The 
		gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that we CAN improve infinitely, line 
		upon line and precept upon precept. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe that the magical 
		mortal ingredient of excellence is actually ATTITUDE, or, in other 
		words, will not skill. My mother, who was a wise and caring teacher, 
		often said that, as far as her students were concerned, she appreciated 
		I will! far more than I.Q. A five-year study of many top US 
		athletes, musicians, and scholars recently found that drive and 
		determination, not great natural talent, led to their extraordinary 
		success.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">5</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		One prominent self-improvement guru described that drive as an 
		absolute sense of mission,</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">6</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		and considered it to be the common thread of all outstanding people. 
		That sense of mission is often coupled with a willingness to 
		sacrifice. Excellent people understand that there is a price to be paid 
		for success. And the underlying element, supporting both a sense of 
		mission and a willingness to sacrifice, is faith, both a persons faith 
		in their self and his or her faith in the Lord. Todd Skinner, a 
		world-renowned mountain climber, summed up this faithful drive toward 
		excellence when he said, </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">We do not change the mountain, we change 
		ourselves. We cannot lower the mountain, therefore we must elevate 
		ourselves.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sometimes we put limits on 
		what we think we can do, but our capacity for excellence is far beyond 
		what we might currently imagine. One important way to begin to see our 
		limitless potential is to surround ourselves with excellence. Excellence 
		is <i>inspiring</i> and <i>contagious</i>. Thats the reason why records 
		are constantly being broken, and why a certain team, group, or family 
		might seem to possess a disproportionate number of outstanding members. 
		We might think it has to do with genetics, or even a 
		performance-enhancing drug, but, more often than not, its nothing as 
		simple as DNA or steroids. Rather, there is a Spirit of Excellence that 
		can inspire and motivate us. When we surround ourselves with excellence, 
		when we study it and expose ourselves to it, that inspiration and 
		encouragement can eventually begin to help us disregard what we might 
		have considered stumbling blocks to success: A lack of natural talent or 
		skill, an absence of resources, less than ideal circumstances, or even 
		past experiences or failures.</font></p>

		that, and I want to share their stories with you as a way of inspiring 
		you to reach a little higher. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I imagine youve all read or 
		heard at least a little about the woman on the left. This is Helen 
		Keller. Helen was deaf <i>and</i> blind but became a great humanitarian 
		around the world, traveling and giving speeches about everything from 
		her history to human rights. When Helen was just a toddler, she 
		contracted a raging fever. The doctors of the time diagnosed this as 
		acute congestion of the stomach and brain but, whatever it was, it 
		robbed this previously healthy child of both her sight and her hearing. 
		Her parents were heartbroken at what had happened to their darling baby 
		girl. Incredibly, though, no one could take Helens determination and 
		will away from her, and, by the time she was eleven years old, she could 
		position her hand with her middle finger on a persons nose, her 
		forefinger on their lips, and her thumb on their throat and thereby 
		understand what they were saying, all without <i>hearing</i> any sound 
		from their throat or <i>seeing</i> any movement from their mouths.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">7</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Helen went on to attend and 
		graduate from Radcliffe University, the top womens university of her 
		day. Referring to her preparation to attend Radcliffe, one of her tutors 
		commented that her ambition and her confidence in her own power to 
		master whatever she has once undertaken are two of her most marked 
		traits of mind.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		This same tutor, on learning she had passed the rigorous entrance exams, 
		called her accomplishment a triumph of ambition stimulated by 
		obstacles.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">9</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And Helen herself said, just 
		prior to her graduation, There is nothing good or right which we cannot 
		accomplish if we have the will to strive.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">10</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Helen Keller obviously possessed that will, that absolute sense of 
		mission, required to overcome her obstacles and achieve excellence.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But she didnt accomplish 
		these things alone. The other woman in the picture, on the right, is her 
		teacher, Anne Sullivan. And Annies story and achievements are every bit 
		as remarkable as Helens. Annie was the daughter of two penniless Irish 
		immigrants. Annie and her younger brother, Jimmie, both suffered with 
		disabilities:&nbsp; Annie was half blind from an eye disease, and Jimmie 
		walked with a crutch because of a tubercular hip. When Annie was ten, 
		her mother died, leaving her alcoholic and abusive father to care for 
		the two children. Within a year, the two children were sent to the 
		poorhouse in their small Massachusetts town. Living in the Tewksbury 
		Poorhouse was a nightmare. There were rumors around town that the only 
		thing the children had to play with there were the rats.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Annie and Jimmie clung 
		tightly to each other. They were all they had in the world. Annie 
		refused to allow them to be separated, as was the practice, so they were 
		given a small bed to sleep in back in a dark corner next to what the 
		residents called the deadhouse, the place where the bodies of those 
		who died were kept while awaiting burial. This frightened the two 
		children horribly but, as long as they were together, they would be 
		alright. However, tragedy struck within about a year and Jimmie died one 
		night from complications of a high fever. By the time Annie awoke, his 
		body was gone, taken to the deadhouse, and she was alone.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Somehow, Annie survived the 
		next few years by herself. Then one day, by sheer persistence and 
		determination, she was able to convince a visiting authority that he 
		should help her escape her awful fate and go to school. She succeeded 
		and, within a year, found herself recovering from two eye surgeries and 
		beginning school at the Perkins School for the Blind. At first, her 
		schooling was even worse than life at the poorhouse. The students, and 
		even the teachers, laughed at this 14-year-old who couldnt even spell 
		her own name. She recorded that she was actually homesick for 
		Tewksbury!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But again, her persistence 
		and determination paid off, and, a few years later, she graduated as the 
		top student in her class. But her degree was certainly not the end of 
		her pursuit of excellence. When she was 20 years old, a professor from 
		Perkins asked if she would go and teach a poor handicapped child named 
		Helen Keller. When Annie heard of Helens circumstances, she was 
		positive she could not be of any use to her. She had no experience 
		teaching a deaf or blind student, and certainly not one who was <i>both!</i> 
		Fortunately for both of them, though, Annie needed the money so 
		desperately that she took the job.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A short while after moving in 
		with the Kellers, she wrote a letter to Mrs. Hopkins, back at the 
		Perkins School. In it, she summarized her feelings at that point about 
		helping Helen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; margin-right: 67.5pt; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Something within me tells me that I shall succeed 
		beyond my dreams . . . I know that [Helen] has remarkable powers, and I 
		believe that I shall be able to develop and mold them. I cannot tell how 
		I know these things. I had no idea a short time ago how to go to work; I 
		was feeling about in the dark, but somehow I know now, and I know that I 
		know.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">11</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It wasnt long before Annie 
		was able to break through Helens dark, silent world, through a teaching 
		method solely of her own creation. Twenty years later, after earning a 
		college degree with honors, Helen <i>spoke </i>to a fascinated audience, 
		saying, The doors of the bright world are flung open before me and a 
		light shines upon me, the light kindled by the thought that there is 
		something for me to do <i>beyond the threshold.</i></font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">12</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Both Helen Keller and Anne 
		Sullivan had so many doors closed to them but their desires to excel 
		opened those doors and allowed them to step over and beyond those 
		thresholds. Each of them was able to accomplish far more than anyone 
		would have ever thought possible. Each of them literally changed the 
		world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">1 Corinthians 1:27 reads, . 
		. . God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things 
		which are mighty. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At times, each one of us 
		feels like we have reached a closed door. We feel weak and incapable of 
		opening the door and stepping over and past its threshold. But the 
		gospel of Jesus Christ, the Plan of Salvation, teaches us and encourages 
		us to do precisely that. Our individual pursuits of excellence can 
		unlock, even <i>fling open</i>, those doors, and expose us to that 
		bright light Helen had seen, the reality that there is <i>something more</i> 
		we can do!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Lets consider a simple 
		diagram that may help clarify the pursuit of excellence. If we divide a 
		triangle into three sub-sections, the supporting or base section can 
		represent faith. Living in faith and righteousness is at the<b> core</b> 
		of achieving excellence. Consider these scriptures:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">
		All things are possible to him that believeth.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">13</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">
		For with God, nothing shall be impossible.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">14</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">
		Seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">15</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Faith, believing in our own 
		potential and believing that God can <i>and will</i> help us, is crucial 
		to crossing the threshold, or going beyond the limit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Dallin H. Oaks has 
		counseled, Your faith will sustain you and give added meaning and 
		increased accomplishment to your secular studies if you will live to 
		deserve the blessings of the Lord.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">16</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Living faithfully and righteously is <i>how</i> we live to deserve the 
		blessings of the Lord. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember the Stripling 
		Warriors? We read in Alma that they did obey and observe to perform 
		every word of command with <i>exactness</i>.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">17</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Do you remember the excellent outcome of their big battle? Every single 
		one of them was injured, but not one died. Now that is going beyond the 
		limit. They <i>deserved</i>, or <i>had earned</i>, the blessings of the 
		Lord. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the greatest blessings 
		of the Lord is the gift of the Spirit.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">When we invite the Holy Ghost to fill our minds 
		with light and knowledge, He . . . enlightens and enlivens the inner man 
		or woman. . . We feel strengthened, filled with peace and joy. We 
		possess spiritual energy and enthusiasm, both of which enhance our 
		natural abilities. We can accomplish more than we otherwise could do on 
		our own.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">18</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I know without a doubt that 
		when I am living in faith and righteousness, when I deserve the Lords 
		blessings and the company of the Holy Ghost, I can do so much more than 
		I could possibly do on my own.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am currently enrolled in a 
		family history course at BYUHawaii. Those who know me well know that I 
		am technically challenged. For several years, I have been afraid to 
		become involved in much of the newly developed computer technology that 
		is so prevalent in genealogical research today. Through attending this 
		class, however, I have begun to feel enlightened and empowered. I know 
		that this is the Holy Ghost helping me learn. I am gradually overcoming 
		my computer fears because I have faith, coupled with a strong and 
		righteous desire, or will, to do family history research.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Annie Sullivan lived in 
		faith, too. Though I know nothing of her religious beliefs, I can tell 
		from reading the excerpts of her letters that this was a woman of faith. 
		She said she had no idea of where to begin but somehow I know now, and 
		I know that I know. I believe she was led by the Spirit on how to 
		proceed to teach Helen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The left portion of our 
		triangle diagram represents that sense of mission, or will to succeed. 
		This requires us to set goals. We all hear a lot about goal setting, 
		especially in January, but let me point out that the surest way to miss 
		your mark is to not even have one. And by setting that mark just 
		slightly out of reach, slightly beyond our current ability, we learn 
		firsthand that there is always room for improvement. We develop humility 
		as we realize that we can always do <i>a little better</i>, <u>
		especially</u> with the Lords help.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Annie and Helen were 
		world-class goal-setters. When Annie set her mind on finding a way out 
		of the poorhouse and into a real school, she determined to do whatever 
		it took, even if that meant literally throwing herself at the feet of a 
		man of power and position. When Helen informed her parents that she 
		would begin studying to pass the college entrance exams, they thought 
		she had lost her mind. Impossible! they said. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of course, setting a goal 
		isnt enough. We then have to make it happen. We should adopt President 
		Kimballs motto as our own and Do it! This is where the right side of 
		the diagram comes into play: Sacrifice. Sacrifice means giving up 
		something good now for something better in the future, and that is 
		exactly what the pursuit of excellence is about.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Since Adam and Eve left the 
		Garden of Eden, mortals have been required to sweat. President Benson 
		counseled us to Work, work, work! There is no satisfactory substitute.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">19</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Often, the difference between 
		work and hard work is not as much as we might think. Champions dont 
		win by running twice as fast, or scoring twice as many points as their 
		opponents. Usually they win by just a fraction of a second, or by just 
		one extra goal. If we were to work just a little harder, say 15 minutes 
		a day, over the course of a year, we would have worked an extra 91 
		hours!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of course, <i>hard</i> work 
		usually requires sacrifice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Two secrets to hard work are 
		to pay attention to the details and to form good habits. General Colin 
		Powell recognized this when he said, If you are going to achieve 
		excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. 
		Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude. And 
		Aristotle could see thousands of years ago that we are what we 
		repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By combining these three keys 
		to excellence, living in faith and righteousness, setting goals to 
		solidify our will or sense of mission, and sacrificing through hard 
		work and attention to detail to reach those goals, we will be able to 
		eventually succeed in whatever we are pursuing, but the <i>eventually</i> 
		part can be discouraging. Patience will be critical. Remember, the view 
		of a champion, and the glory that surrounds him, must never be 
		overshadowed by the long process of becoming one.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">20</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		We love our instant messaging, we require instant relief, and we pay big 
		money for instant satisfaction, but excellence does not come instantly. 
		Persistence and patience are required.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We will experience setbacks, 
		but they are one way we learn to improve. Remember that past failures do 
		not predict future successes. My mother-in-law, Ann Coulam Wheelwright, 
		firmly believed that failure was never in <i>doing</i> but only in <i>
		quitting</i>. With her, quitting was <i>never an option</i>. She 
		considered failure as simply the price of growth and development and a 
		chance to reflect, regroup, and then proceed with renewed vigor. The 
		great painter, Whistler, once advised a friend to hang on the walls of 
		[his] mind the memory of [his] successes. . .</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">21</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		We can do the same and thereby find the endurance to keep trying and 
		keep working until we reach our goals.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord wants to help us 
		reach those goals. He wants to reward us for our faithful living, and He 
		wants to bless us for our righteous sacrifices. This is where grace 
		comes into the picture. Grace can be simply described as the Lord making 
		up the difference, after all we can do. And grace is what will take our 
		best efforts to a higher level, what will make it possible for us to go 
		beyond the limit, or over and far past the threshold of what we assume 
		is possible. Grace is the Atonement at work in every aspect of our 
		lives, including the pursuit of excellence.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Helen Keller said, late in 
		her life, When we do the best we can, we never know what miracle is 
		wrought in our life, or in the life of another.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">22</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Her dear friend and teacher, Anne Sullivan, certainly did her very best 
		for Helen, and Helen knew firsthand what miracles had been wrought in 
		her life because of it. And therein lies the real secret to the pursuit 
		of excellence. When we do the best we can, we never know what miracles 
		the Lord will see fit to bless us or someone else with because of our 
		desire to excel.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Hinckley has said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">My plea is that we constantly take the position 
		that every one of us can do better than we are doing now. We are in a 
		constant search for excellence. That search must be continuous and 
		never-ending. It must be consuming and unrelenting. Happily, such a 
		lofty and crucial pursuit does not require genius. What can I do better 
		today so that the Lord can bless me? We must not sell ourselves short. 
		We must make a little extra effort. We would be wise to kneel before our 
		God in supplication. He will help us. He will bless us. He will comfort 
		and sustain us. He will help us do more, and be more, than we can ever 
		accomplish or become on our own.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">23</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am so grateful for all of 
		the miracles the Lord has blessed me with in my life.&nbsp; I know that He 
		lives and that He loves me and He loves you.&nbsp; I know that with His help 
		and direction our lives can be filled with experiences and opportunities 
		far beyond our mortal abilities.&nbsp; The Atonement is real and blesses each 
		one of us when we allow it to change our hearts and our minds.&nbsp; I know 
		that through His grace He will make our good better and our better best 
		after all we can do.&nbsp; I am so grateful for that knowledge and assurance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I pray that the Lord will 
		bless each one of you in your striving for excellence, that, as 
		President Hinckley has urged, we will all have this as a continuous and 
		never-ending desire in each of our lives.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>

		produces narrow rings, while increased rainfall will increase growth, 
		producing wider rings.&nbsp; Continuous narrow rings suggest crowding from 
		neighboring trees.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<span style="line-height: 120%; color: #000080"><font size="3">Forest 
		fires can cause a fire scar on the ring, marking the year the fire took 
		place.&nbsp; By counting the annual rings between fire scars, you can 
		determine how many fires there were during the life of the tree.&nbsp; 
		Floods, insects, and other things also leave their marks. Just as the 
		rings on a tree record its history, <u>our own life's history is also 
		being recorded in Heaven, in our Book of Life</u>.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am highly honored to 
			have been asked to address you in this devotional.&nbsp; I have great 
			respect for this University; participating, even in a small way, in 
			the process of helping young men and women take their place in 
			society is exciting and challenging.&nbsp; As you know Im the Managing 
			Director of the Perpetual Education Fund.&nbsp; I have been in this 
			position since I was released as a General Authority and its so 
			satisfying because, like this University, the Perpetual Education 
			Fund is engaged in preparing young men and women for their lifes 
			work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I worked for Ford Motor 
			Company for thirty-five years before I retired.&nbsp; During my career 
			with Ford Motor Company, I saw hundreds of young people come into 
			the company from virtually all the great universities in this 
			nation.&nbsp; In those days, Ford hired about one out of every fifteen 
			students we interviewed on college campuses.&nbsp; In a year, we would 
			talk to several thousand young people as we searched for employees 
			that we believed could contribute to the success of the Company.&nbsp; I 
			was closely associated with this process and I think I have some 
			understanding of students, how they think, their aspirations and 
			their concerns.&nbsp; I think I understand, too, some of the qualities it 
			will take to be successful member of society and thats what I want 
			to talk about today.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was a senior at 
			BYU, I enrolled in a religion class taught by William F. Edwards, 
			the Dean of the College of Business.&nbsp; Professor Edwards had retired 
			early from a very successful career on Wall Street.&nbsp; He left that 
			career to come to BYU to do what he enjoyed mostparticipate in the 
			process of educating young people.&nbsp; Professor Edwards class was not 
			an easy one.&nbsp; It consisted of lectures on 15 different subjects.&nbsp; 
			These were subjects on which he had strong views, which he believed 
			had contributed importantly to his success. We were expected to do 
			research and submit a paper each week on our interpretation of the 
			assigned subjects.&nbsp; These papers were graded and returned to us 
			promptly.&nbsp; At the end of the course we were given a small three-ring 
			binder to hold our papersIve brought with me the very binder from 
			that class.&nbsp; Inside there is a title page that reads:&nbsp; fifteen 
			Points on the Compass of Life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It was a great class.&nbsp; 
			Over the years, Ive read and re-read sections of this loose leaf.&nbsp; 
			Let me share with you the titles of these 15 papers.&nbsp; I think youll 
			find them interesting and some a little unusual for a religion 
			class:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have cherished the 
			advice given to me by Professor Edwards.&nbsp; I have come to realize how 
			incredibly wise his words were.&nbsp; His counsel has made a difference 
			in my life and the life of my family. For example, a few weeks ago, 
			my eldest daughter suggested that I teach a lesson on budgeting at 
			Family Home Evening to our college-enrolled grandchildren living in 
			Utah.&nbsp; I used many of the thoughts in this book in my remarks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I indicated, I should 
			like to leave with you some thoughts on which I have strong views 
			based on my lifes experiences.&nbsp; Ive called it, Four Points on 
			Your Compass of Life.&nbsp; I hope youll find it useful; Id love to 
			think that in fifty years youd remember even one of these points.&nbsp; 
			They are:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chart your 
			lifes course now.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get all the 
			education you can.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live a 
			seamless life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn and 
			master the power of love.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The First Point for Your 
			Compass:&nbsp; <u>Chart Your Lifes Course Now</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me explain what 
			charting is:&nbsp; When mariners started a voyage they used a chart or 
			map to lay out a course to ensure they wouldnt get lost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At this point, youre 
			feeling pretty good about what youve accomplished.&nbsp; You should.&nbsp; Up 
			to now you have prepared yourself well.&nbsp; Youre on your way and when 
			you graduate youll be in an elite group of the nations 
			population.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is my belief, however, 
			that in 10 to 15 years, if you dont chart your lifes course, many 
			of you will have varying degrees of unhappiness with what you have 
			accomplished.&nbsp; To help you avoid these disappointments, you need to 
			define <u>now</u> <u>what</u> you want to achieve in life and <u>
			what</u> actions are necessary to get you there and commit these 
			actions to writing.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Youve got to decide 
			whether you want to partake of the fruit of the tree of life or 
			whether you want to view the world from the great and spacious 
			building.&nbsp; I assume your goal is the fruit of the tree of life.&nbsp; If 
			it isnt, I advise you to make a course correction. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am an optimist.&nbsp; I am a 
			firm believer that you can control your destiny.&nbsp; Fulfillment of 
			your dreams is not so much a matter of intelligence or good fortune 
			as it is a combination of establishing sound goals, focusing, taking 
			action and being willing to sacrifice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I suggest that before you 
			start your charting work, you read President Kimballs The Miracle 
			of Forgiveness, Chapter 17, Charting a Safe Course.&nbsp; If I were 
			President of this University for a day, I would make this chapter 
			required reading for every student.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Kimball points 
			out that we cant foresee every circumstance in life, but we can see 
			most of the important decisions that we need to make, decisions 
			that, if made correctly now, will ensure happiness and success.&nbsp; 
			These decisions are straightforward and uncomplicated.&nbsp; President 
			Kimball calls for driving down stakes.&nbsp; The stakes are of two 
			kinds. This I <i>will</i> do and This I <i>will not</i> do.&nbsp; 
			These stakes involve such things as dating, temple marriage, the 
			family and time for gospel living, honoring church covenants, 
			honoring marriage covenants, etc.&nbsp; Read this chapter in preparation 
			for charting your lifes course.&nbsp; Drive down some stakes of your 
			own.&nbsp; It wont give you answers for all the issues you will face but 
			it will give you a solid foundation for beginning the charting 
			process. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For all other charting 
			issues, use all the help you can get in defining your goals.&nbsp; Get 
			buy in where its appropriate.&nbsp; Consult with others-your spouse 
			(if youre married), your parents, a respected friend, a member of 
			the facultysomeone you trust.&nbsp; And, by all means, seek divine help 
			through fasting and prayer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While the issues 
			mentioned by President Kimball, hopefully are cast in stone, others 
			are not.&nbsp; Many of them will change with time and insight.&nbsp; It would 
			not be wise to commit yourself to a course of action and make no 
			changes despite receiving information that suggests a change is 
			highly appropriate.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Something else to 
			consider on setting goals:&nbsp; It has been my experience that our 
			greatest regrets come from not challenging ourselves sufficiently 
			rather than from setting goals that are too aggressive.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Preparing your lifes 
			goals will put you in another select group; very few people commit 
			their objectives to writing.&nbsp; Keep in mind, however, committing them 
			to writing is the easy part.&nbsp; The <u>difficult part</u> is getting 
			yourself to take the action necessary to achieve them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Anthony Robbins has 
			written an interesting book entitled <u>Unlimited Power.</u>&nbsp; In 
			the book it says:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Often we get caught in 
			the mental trap of seeing enormously successful people and thinking 
			they are where they are because they have some special gift.&nbsp; Yet a 
			closer look shows that the greatest gift that extraordinarily 
			successful people have over the average person is their ability to 
			get themselves to take action.&nbsp; Its a gift that any of us can 
			develop within ourselves. <sup><font size="1">1</font></sup> </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My Professor Edwards 
			counsel, was that at your age, your lifes goals should be concerned 
			with filling your Joy Account. Whats a Joy Account?&nbsp; Heres 
			what I said 55 years ago.&nbsp; I havent changed my mind:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Early in life each 
			individual should decide for himself the true measure of success.&nbsp; 
			We must remember that the true measure of success is not worldly 
			goods but rather those intangible assets that have eternal value; 
			you cannot take worldly goods with you, therefore, if youre to 
			enjoy yourself in the world to come you must create for yourself a 
			joy account.&nbsp; This leads to the true measure of success which 
			consists in such things as charity, missionary work, paying tithing, 
			living the word of wisdom, keeping the Sabbath day holy and many 
			others.&nbsp; These represent assets that have eternal value, assets that 
			can be used both in this life and the life to come.&nbsp; By accumulating 
			these assets of this side we can build up our joy account to consist 
			of the money that they use on the other side.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I want to close my 
			remarks on this point by sharing with you what President Kimball 
			said about those who move through life without a plan:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Like a mariner without 
			stars, like a traveler without a compass, is the person who moves 
			along through life without a plan.&nbsp; The assurance of supreme 
			happiness, the certainty of a successful life here and of exaltation 
			and eternal life hereafter, come to those who plan to live their 
			lives in complete harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christand then 
			consistently follow the course they have set.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify to you that 
			President Kimballs counsel about charting your lifes course is 
			true.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Second Point for your 
			Compass of Life:&nbsp; <u>Get all the Education You Can.</u> <sup>
<font size="1">3</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in">
<font color="#000080">It is a tough old world out there.&nbsp; As Robert 
			Fulghum says:&nbsp; Life is lumpy! <sup><font size="1">4</font></sup>

			years&nbsp; after you graduate will be selling yourselves.&nbsp; It doesnt 
			take a genius to understand that the better educated you are, the 
			better prepared you are, the more likely it will be that you will 
			achieve your goals. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Gordon B. 
			Hinckley has taught us about many subjects in the years that he has 
			been a member of the First Presidency.&nbsp; Few, however, have been 
			taught as regularly and with as much passion as education. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Education is more than

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Hinckley has 
			taught this subject to men and to women, to young people and to 
			parents.&nbsp; His statements clearly raise the bar on educational 
			attainment.&nbsp; Consider this small sample of his teachings on this 
			subject:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now is the great day of

			ever made, for you will reap returns from it all the days of your 
			lives.Do the very best you can.&nbsp; Maybe you are not an A student.&nbsp; 
			Maybe you are not a B student.&nbsp; Maybe you are not a genius; most 
			of us are not.&nbsp; In fact, the majority of us are not. I have 
			concluded that the work of the world is done by ordinary people who 
			learned to work in an extraordinary way. <sup><font size="1">6</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Education becomes the 
			key of opportunity for everyone in this life.&nbsp; It may involve

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Living a seamless life is 
			a matter of integrity.&nbsp; I used to be asked often as I interviewed

			Christ was a detriment to my career.&nbsp; The answer is a resounding NO!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The world is searching

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In October Conference in

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b>As a physician, 
			who has been deeply privileged to share the most profound moments of

			secret. &nbsp;People facing death dont think about what degrees they 
			have earned, what positions they have held, or how much wealth they 
			have accumulated.&nbsp; At the end, what really matters is whom you loved 
			and who loved you.&nbsp; That circle of love is everything, and is a good

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What did Christ say about 
			love?&nbsp; Let me quote from John 13:34-35:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A new commandment I give 
			unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye 
			also love one another.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By this shall all men 
			know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The world generally 
			defines charity as alms or benevolence.&nbsp; Our Bible Dictionary (page 
			632) defines charity as The highest noblest, strongest kind of 
			love, not merely affection; the pure love of Christ. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was a mission 
			president, my missionaries would ask me what makes a good 
			missionary?&nbsp; I gave them four things; The first on my list was Love 
			your companion with a Christ-like love.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Messengers 
			need to match the message.&nbsp; A disciple of Christ needs to bring a 
			message of love.&nbsp; How can he if he doesnt show that love for his 
			companion?&nbsp; Investigators can detect love and respect between 
			companions.&nbsp; When it is lacking, they are turned off. When they see 
			it, it helps to invite the Spirit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Think of the two or three 
			people that you most admire.&nbsp; Think of the things that make them 
			stand outisnt it the love and respect they show to their fellow 
			human beings? This love and respect will do the same for you.&nbsp; It is 
			not just an attitude change but an attribute that you need to 
			identify, refine and develop. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I promise you that if you 
			can master this attribute:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This concept of the power

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It does have the capacity

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">It is amazing to me how fast 
		time passes. This is especially true when I think that the majority of 
		you students were not even born when Barbara and I were first invited to 
		come to Ricks College. On one occasion, I was guiding a visiting 
		dignitary on a tour of the campus. We entered a chemistry lecture hall 
		that had a huge periodic chart of all the elements on the front wall. I 
		commented, There are surely more elements on that chart than there were 
		when I took chemistry in high school.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		The faculty member who was accompanying us responded, Well, President, 
		when you took chemistry there were probably only four elements: earth, 
		fire, water, and air.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		So it goes.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Some of the choice years of our lives were spent here at what was then 
		Ricks College. We learned to love the students, faculty, administrators, 
		and community. We came to know that there is a special spirit that 
		pervades the Upper Snake River Valley. Some of the finest people we have 
		ever known are products of this area. Now, in this revolutionary time of 
		development at BYUIdaho, we are impressed with the inspired leadership 
		of President Clark and those who serve with him and who are providing 
		this favored environment for you.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		And to think that with all the rest of the developments here, you are 
		now blessed to have a magnificent temple of the Lord adjacent to the 
		campus. There is no other institution of higher education that is so 
		blessed.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Over the years, Barbara and I have had many opportunities to come in 
		contact with tens of thousands of university students and tens of 
		thousands of missionaries. In all that time, we have never met even one 
		person who did not want to be happy and successful.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		For the remainder of our time together, I would like to make you a 
		promise. If you really analyze yourself honestly about where you are in 
		your life, what you are doing, and follow the suggestions well discuss 
		in the next few minutes, I am convinced that you will be happier and 
		more successful in your lives. On the other hand, if you dont, you 
		could bring a lot of misery and failure to yourselves and immense pain 
		to those who love you the most. It is that simple.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		As parents, we worried about the challenges our six children faced in 
		the environment in which they were growing up, but, frankly, we are even 
		more concerned about our grandchildrenpeople your age. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		You have all heard of the normal curve. I suppose many of you have 
		been in classes where the teachers graded on a curve. Some few would get 
		As, a few more would get Bs, more would get Cs, some would get Ds, and a 
		few would fail.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		In prior times, young people themselves could have been distributed 
		along such a normal curvea few outstanding, most somewhere in the 
		middle, and a few off the track. Today, and over the past few years, the 
		situation has dramatically changed, even within the Church. Rather than 
		the normal curve, it seems to me that there is a bimodal distribution, 
		like a camels humps, of young people, in which we see righteousness, on 
		the one hand, or evil on the other, developing in their lives. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Those who are on track, I think, have never been better, and those who 
		are off the track have never been in more trouble or farther away from 
		where they should be.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Remember the parable of the tares and wheat. Speaking to angels who were 
		ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields, the Lord 
		gave this instruction: Let the wheat and the tares grow together until 
		the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from 
		among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, 
		the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.
		<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		In a devotional such as this many years ago, Dr. Truman Madsen said: 
		You live in a generation where the tares aregetting tarier and the 
		wheat getting wheatier. And the contest is real. <br />
<br />
		President Boyd K. Packer, speaking to a group of lawyers and judges, put 
		our current challenging situation into perspective when he said: <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		These are days of great spiritual danger for this people. The world is 
		spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell you 
		that it will not get better. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in the history of the 
		world to compare with our present circumstances. Nothing happened in 
		Sodom and Gomorrah which exceeds the wickedness and depravity which 
		surrounds us now. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Two massive nationwide studies of teenagers and college-age young adults 
		have been recently reported. The first was a groundbreaking study of 
		American teenagers and religion, conducted by the University of North 
		Carolina at Chapel Hill. The study indicated that of all the religious 
		groups surveyed, Mormons fared best at avoiding risky behaviors, doing 
		well in school, and having a positive attitude about the future. <br />
<br />
		The other study came from the Higher Education Research Institute at 
		UCLA. This study, mentioned that young people from our Church were 
		having the fewest problems as a group. It also revealed that Latter-day 
		Saint young people pray more, are more moral, and, in general, rank 
		number 1 when it comes to the effect of religion on their lives.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		From a Church standpoint, these are tremendous compliments, but the 
		reality is that as an individual today, you likely are among the group 
		of the wheatiest, or the very best, in the Churchbut if you make a 
		few poor choices, you could easily find yourself among the tariest, 
		the worst. The contest is very real. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		It is very easy to get off the track. You need all the spiritual help 
		you can get. At this time, all you young adults have your biggest and 
		most important decisions of your lives ahead of you. They are: <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		 What standards and ideals will I choose to govern my life? <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		 How will I make a living? What will I do to prepare myself with skills 
		and training to be able to support my family?<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		 For the single adults: Who will become my eternal companion in 
		marriage?<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Here are some suggestions that will help you make the right decisions in 
		your life and will assist you to be happier and more successful:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
<b>First: Take advantage of every opportunity you have to learn the 
		gospel.<br />
</b><br />
		What do the Lord and His prophets have to say about this? Lets read a 
		scripture together found in Doctrine and Covenants 88:7778:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		And I give unto you a commandment [not a suggestion] that you shall 
		teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be 
		instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the 
		law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, 
		that are expedient for you to understand. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Listen to the following quotations from prophets, seers, and revelators 
		about the importance of studying the gospel. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		A member of the First Presidency way back in 1838 was speaking to a 
		group of relatively new members of the Church (I suppose everyone at 
		that time was a relatively new member of the Church) who apparently 
		thought that all they had to do was be baptized, receive the gift of the 
		Holy Ghost, and then sit back and wait to be ushered into the celestial 
		glory. He said: <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Vain are the hopes of those who embrace the gospel, and then suppose . . 
		. they have nothing more to do but hold on to what they have. . . . The 
		great God . . . never thought of . &nbsp;. raising up a society of 
		ignoramuses, but of men and women of intelligence; of first 
		intelligence. Of intelligence as high as human nature was susceptible.
		<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		President Brigham Young, speaking to a group of elders, said:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		There are a great many branches of education: some go to college to 
		learn languages, some to study law, some to study physic[s], and some to 
		study astronomy, and various other branches of science. . . . But our 
		favourite study is that branch which particularly belongs to the Elders 
		of Israelnamely, theology. Every Elder should become a profound 
		theologianshould understand this branch better than all the world. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		President Young mentioned Elders, but if he were here today speaking 
		to you sisters, he would say that it is just as important for every 
		woman in the Church to study academic subjects and to become a profound 
		theologian. In fact, President Gordon B. Hinckley said that President 
		Young was once asked what he would do if he had to choose between 
		providing education for his sons or for his daughters. He replied that 
		he would educate his daughters because they would become the mothers of 
		his grandchildren. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		That indicates how important it is for you young sisters to become 
		gospel scholars, profound theologians, and well-educated. And it takes 
		real effort to become profound at anything.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		President Spencer W. Kimball expressed his opinion this way:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Every girl, and I say every girl, should prepare herself for marriage 
		and for domestic responsibilities. . . &nbsp;She should become skilled in 
		things that are useful and enriching to her family life. . . . We want 
		our women to be well educated, for children may not recover from the 
		ignorance of their mothers. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		I used to think and hope that as a father I would have some positive 
		influence with our children. I soon learned that, far more than their 
		father, generally, it is the mother who has the greatest influence on 
		them.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		For example, during the early 1970s I had the privilege of serving as an 
		associate commissioner to Elder Neal A. Maxwell in the Commissioner of 
		Educations office. My responsibility was to administer the seminaries 
		and institutes of religion. The Church Board of Educationthen 
		consisting of the First Presidency, the Twelve, and othershad made the 
		decision that the seminaries and institutes of religion should be 
		available for members of the Church throughout the world. Until that 
		time, seminaries and institutes had been in English-speaking areas only.
		<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Our six children were young at the time, and there were several 
		occasions when I was on international assignments and had to be away 
		from home for three weeks at a time. It was then that I especially 
		appreciated my wife Barbaras homemaking skills, her good judgment, her 
		college education, her mission, and, particularly, her knowledge and 
		testimony of the gospel. I knew that our children were in very good 
		hands.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		My hope is that all you future husbands and fathers can have that same 
		assurance.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		President J. Reuben Clark Jr. said:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		There is spiritual learning just as there is material learning, and the 
		one without the other is not complete; yet, speaking for myself, if I 
		could have only one sort of learning, that which I would take would be 
		the learning of the spirit, because in the hereafter I shall have 
		opportunity in the eternities which are to come to get the other, and 
		without spiritual learning here my handicaps in the hereafter would be 
		all but overwhelming. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Elder John A. Widtsoe, who was a nationally known specialist in science 
		and who served as president of both what is now Utah State University 
		and the University of Utah before he was called to be a member of the 
		Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		It is a paradox that men will gladly devote time every day for many 
		years to learn a science or art; yet will expect to win a knowledge of 
		the gospel, which comprehends all sciences and arts, through perfunctory 
		glances at books or occasional listening to sermons. <i>The gospel 
		should be studied more intensively than any school or college subject. 
		They who pass opinion on the gospel without having given it intimate and 
		careful study are not lovers of the truth, and their opinions are 
		worthless. </i><br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		So there you are. Here at BYUIdaho, you are in the right place. 
		Remember that your opportunities to study courses in religion and to 
		participate in the student wards and stakes are some of the great 
		benefits of your being at BYUIdaho.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		I must add that the one life's experience that will be most helpful in 
		learning the Gospel and preparing you for future Church service, is to 
		serve an honorable full-time mission. &nbsp;That is true for all you brethren 
		who fulfill that priesthood responsibility and for any of you sisters 
		who receive the opportunity.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
<b>Second: Success in your university courses is also very important. 
		Learn all you can, and get the best grades you can <i>honestly</i> get.<br />
</b><br />
		After all these quotations about the importance of studying the gospel 
		on your own and with your family, that doesnt mean that your university 
		subjects are not important. In this information age, they are <i>
		extremely</i> important. Apply every effort to become the best scholar 
		you can possible become in your area of specialty.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Following the verses we read earlier from section 88, the Lord lets us 
		know the areas in which members of the Church should become 
		knowledgeable. We should learn of things both in heaven and in the 
		earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, 
		things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things 
		which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the 
		judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and 
		of kingdomsthat [we] may be prepared in all things. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		That one verse suggests areas of study that include &nbsp;astronomy, biology, 
		botany, geology, history, current events, domestic issues, futurity, 
		wars and the perplexities of nations, natural disasters, and geography, 
		to name a few. As mentioned, the Lord never intended to raise up a 
		society of ignoramuses.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Take every advantage to learn all you can and get the best grades you 
		can honestly get. Notice that I emphasized the word <i>honestly.</i> 
		Avoid cheating in all its forms.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		 A national survey by Rutgers Management Education Center of 4,500 
		high school students, found that 75 percent of them engage in serious 
		cheating. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		 More than half have plagiarized work they found on the Internet. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		 Perhaps most disturbing, many of them dont see anything wrong with 
		cheating: Some 50 percent of those responding to the survey said they 
		dont think copying questions and answers from a test is cheating. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Sister Janette C. Hales shared this experience when she was serving as 
		the general president of the Young Women of the Church:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Her husband practiced medicine, and she told of this experience:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		As you know, it isnt easy to get into medical school, and as you would 
		guess, freshman students are not only enthusiastic but are committed to 
		very hard work. My husband said he still remembers going to his first 
		examination at the University of Utah. The honor system was in place. As 
		the professor passed out the examination and left the room, he said some 
		classmates started to pull out little cheat papers from pockets and from 
		under their books. He said, My heart began to pound, and I realized how 
		difficult it is to compete with cheaters. It appeared that this was a 
		practice that must have been common in some settings in the past. About 
		then a tall, thin student stood up in the back of the room and said, I 
		left my hometown and put my wife and three little children in an 
		upstairs apartment to go to medical school, and Ill turn in the first 
		one of you who cheats and YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT! They believed it. My 
		husband said he looked like Abraham Lincoln. There were many sheepish 
		expressions, and those cheat papers started to disappear as fast as they 
		had appeared. Its interesting that that class graduated the largest 
		graduating class in the history of the school. That young man set a 
		standard of hard work and cooperation instead of dishonesty. That man 
		cared more about character than popularity. . . .. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		That young medical student was J Ballard Washburn, who achieved 
		significant recognition in his practice of medicine and was later called 
		to the Second Quorum of the Seventy and served as one of the General 
		Authorities of the Church. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Decide today that you will not cheat. Just because there are others 
		doing it doesnt make it right. Ease your conscience. Set the example 
		for all the other students. Others will learn to follow and develop the 
		integrity our whole society needs so desperately.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		You are now participating in a learning experience that will make a big 
		difference in your being able to be not just good, but good for 
		something. You will have the satisfaction of knowing that the world is 
		somehow better because you are in it. Commit yourself now to receive as 
		much training and education as you possibly can, and you will become 
		skilled at producing goods or services for which people will be willing 
		to pay you. With good educational preparation, you brethren will be more 
		able to support your future families effectively. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Achieving success in your university education will pay significant 
		dividends. A study conducted in 2004 indicated that the median annual 
		income for men with a high school diploma was $36,000. The holder of a 
		bachelors degree earned, on median, $57,000. Finally, the holder of a 
		masters degree, a doctorate, or a professional degree typically bumped 
		up the annual earnings to between $72,000 and $100,000. <br />
<br />
		Success in your educational endeavors can help you achieve greater 
		success and happiness.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
<b>Third: Live up to the Lords commandment to love one another. <br />
</b><br />
		Just before the Savior went to Gethsemane and on to Calvary, He gave His 
		disciples a lot of instructions in the Upper Room. Within the 
		instructions, He gave them a new commandmentnot a suggestion. We read 
		in John 13:3435 the following:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;  <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one 
		to another.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		If you are really serious about being happy and successful in your life, 
		learn to love people and treat them as you would like to be treated. 
		Along with whatever skills you learn from your education, develop the 
		skills to relate well with others. In addition to obeying the Lords 
		commandment to love one another, read Dale Carnegies practical and 
		readable book <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> and apply 
		its principles in your associations with others wherever life takes 
		youon your missions, in your work, in your marriage and family.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The word <i>love</i> is difficult to understand in English, Spanish, 
		Portuguese, and probably a number of other languages with which I am not 
		familiar. For example, I could say to all of you, I love you and mean 
		it sincerely. I use those identical three words speaking to my wife, 
		Barbara, I love you, and I mean something very different because, 
		obviously, there are different kinds of love. We need to know who is 
		speaking to whom and in what context to know what we mean by the word <i>
		love.</i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The Greeks dont have this problem because in their language they have 
		three words and each expresses a different kind of love. The first Greek 
		word is <i>eros,</i> or romantic lovethe kind of love that attracts a 
		person to a member of the opposite sex. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		The second kind of love is <i>philia.</i> This is the horizontal kind of 
		lovethe kind that ought to exist among us as friends, class mates, 
		neighbors, brothers and sisters in the gospel. If I could speak Greek 
		and sincerely say to all of you, I love you, <i>philia</i> or one of 
		its derivatives is the word I would use. It is brotherly lovein fact, 
		Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, gets its name from this 
		Greek root.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Finally, the third type of love is <i>agape.</i> This kind of love could 
		be defined as godlike. It is exemplified by the capacity of our Father 
		in Heaven and our Savior to love us even though there isnt one of us 
		who is perfect. They love us anyway. Generally, I think mothers are 
		blessed with this capacity. Maybe some of you have met someone you think 
		only a mother could love. I have been told that this is the word used in 
		the Greek text of the New Testament each time the Lord commands us to 
		love even our enemies. It is a very different and more difficult kind of 
		love. It is the type of love that allows us to overlook the perceived 
		faults or shortcomings of others and work to strengthen our 
		relationships. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Here is the point: <i>Philia</i> and <i>agape</i> are universals. We 
		should love everyone in one or another of these kinds of love. <i>Eros,</i> 
		or romantic love, is not a universal. We are not commanded to love 
		everyone romantically. To be happy and successful in your life, you will 
		always remember this important point. Keep yourself morally clean.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		The expression of romantic, physical affection is not a game. Consider 
		this graph: Suppose this base line represents a persons life from birth 
		to 90+ years of age. Chart how attraction toward members of the opposite 
		sex develops. The line goes from zero at birth and rises to the age when 
		the attraction will be as strong as it likely will ever be in your 
		lifeat about ages 19 to 21. Isnt it interesting what the Lord chooses 
		to do at about that time in peoples lives? He calls them on missions, 
		and for two years (or eighteen months for the sisters), physical contact 
		with members of the opposite sex is limited to shaking handsbriefly.
		<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		We often, as a Church, underestimate the powerful influence that 
		guideline has on creating more stable and faithful marriages and 
		families because such individuals have learned self-control. They are 
		not driven by, or succumb to, every romantic feeling that may come into 
		their system.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Always remember that the sharing of romantic, physical affection is not 
		a game and that sexual intimacy is meant by the Lord to be between a man 
		and a woman inside the bonds of marriage.<br />
<b><br />
		Fourth: Decide now that you will not get involved in <i>any</i> form of 
		pornography. <br />
</b><br />
		In the First Epistle of John, we read, For all that is in the world, 
		the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, . . . is not of the 
		Father, but is of the world. Pornography involves the lust of the 
		eyes and often leads to the lust of the flesh.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		When we first came to Ricks College, those many years ago, there were 
		only about six computers available in the library for personal use. Now 
		they tell me there are more than 1,500 personal computers available for 
		student use; in addition, most of you likely have one of your own.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Pornography is all around us, and every one of you knows that. At the 
		click of a computer mouse, you can be flooded with the vilest of immoral 
		images, and watching such trash can become addictive. Your spirituality, 
		your activity in the Church, and even your future marriage can be 
		destroyed by it. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		There was good reason why President Hinckley, in the October 2004 
		priesthood session of general conference, devoted his whole address to 
		this serious problem. I have never heard him speak more seriously or 
		more directly. In the following April general conference, Elder Oaks 
		gave a powerful address on the same subject. I suggest that we all 
		reread both messages and follow the counsel in them.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
<b>Fifth: Decide now that you will always remain active in the Church.
		<br />
</b><br />
		Remember the words of the Lord: And whoso taketh upon him my name, and 
		endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day (3 Nephi 
		27: 6; see also 1617).<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		That is a conscious decision you can make right now. You will not let 
		anything sway you from remaining committed to the covenants you have 
		made to be a solid and faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		When one person chooses to leave activity in the Church, the effects can 
		be spiritually catastrophic for generations to come. Let me tell you 
		about William Weeks, who was selected by the Prophet Joseph Smith to be 
		the architect for the Nauvoo Temple. He considered that project to be 
		his lifes greatest accomplishment. When the Saints were driven from 
		Nauvoo and came west, he brought the plans with him. Not many years 
		after they arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, he was bent out of shape by 
		some kind of conflict, and he chose to leave the Church and took his 
		family and the architectural plans to California. As a result of his 
		defection, his entire posterity for generations grew up outside the 
		Church and its blessings. There would have been hundreds of themmaybe 
		even more than 1,000. There is a message there for all of us about the 
		importance of remaining faithful to our covenants and what can happen to 
		us and those who follow us if we do not.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		On the positive side, President Hinckley told of what can happen when 
		just one person chooses to remain active in the Church. He shared this 
		story: <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Years ago, President Charles A. Callis, then a member of the Quorum of 
		the Twelve, but who previously was president of the Southern States 
		Mission for twenty-five years, told me this story. He said that he had a 
		missionary in the southern states who came in to get his release at the 
		conclusion of his mission. His mission president said to him, Have you 
		had a good mission? <br />
<br />
		He said, No. <br />
<br />
		How is that? <br />
<br />
		Well, I havent had any results from my work. I have wasted my time and 
		my fathers money. Its been a waste of time.<br />
<br />
		Brother Callis said, Havent you baptized anyone? <br />
<br />
		He said, I baptized only one person during the two years that I have 
		been here. That was a twelve-year-old boy up in the back hollows of 
		Tennessee. <br />
<br />
		He went home with a sense of failure. Brother Callis said, I decided to 
		follow that boy who had been baptized. I wanted to know what became of 
		him. The next time I went up into that area I looked him up. He had put 
		on shoes (hed never worn shoes before), hed put on a shirt (hed never 
		had a shirt before), he was the clerk of the little branch Sunday 
		School. <br />
<br />
		Brother Callis said, I followed him through the years. He became the 
		Sunday School Superintendent, and he eventually became the branch 
		president. He married. He moved off the little tenant farm on which he 
		and his parents before him had lived and got a piece of ground of his 
		own and made it fruitful. He became the district president. He sold that 
		piece of ground in Tennessee and moved to Idaho and bought a farm along 
		the Snake River and prospered there. His children grew. They went on 
		missions. They came home. They had children of their own who went on 
		missions.<br />
<br />
		Brother Callis continued, Ive just spent a week up in Idaho looking up 
		every member of that family that I could find and talking to them about 
		their missionary service. I discovered that, as the result of the 
		baptism of that one little boy in the back hollows of Tennessee by a 
		missionary who thought he had failed, more than 1,100 people have come 
		into the Church. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Your decision to remain active in the Church will have consequences for 
		good for generations to come.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
<b>Sixth: Always live your life so you can have a current temple 
		recommend in your possession and use it as frequently as your 
		circumstances allow.<br />
</b><br />
		You know the questions your bishop and stake president ask. The 
		questions deal with almost every major area of our physical and 
		spiritual lives. We are asked to analyze ourselves in terms of honesty 
		(that includes not cheating), obeying the Word of Wisdom, activity in 
		the Church, morality, commitment to tithing, sustaining our leaders, and 
		so on.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Each time I have shared the following experience, it has been helpful to 
		me, and hopefully it will be of value to you. &nbsp;My sister, just older 
		than I, set this very powerful example for me. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		For many years, she had been the main caregiver for her husband, who had 
		multiple sclerosis and whose body had come to the point that he required 
		almost around-the-clock care. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		One day, my sister was not feeling well, so she went for an appointment 
		with her doctor. Stomach cancer was diagnosed. It had spread from her 
		stomach to her liver and other abdominal organs. It was inoperable, and 
		she was told that she likely had a very short time to live. She never 
		returned home again. During the weeks she was in the hospital, her 
		temple recommend expired. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		When it appeared that she had just a few days left to live, while 
		visiting with her Latter-day Saint cancer specialist she said, I would 
		like to be buried with a current temple recommend. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		He replied, I dont think they need to use them over there. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Nevertheless, she answered, I want to be buried with a current temple 
		recommend.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Her bishop and stake president came and interviewed her. She passed away 
		a few days later, and she was buried with a current temple recommend.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		With that example, I hope and intend to do the same. I always want to 
		live in such a way that I will be able to look my bishop and stake 
		president in the eye and answer their questions honestly and 
		appropriately. I always want to have in my possession a current temple 
		recommend, and, as we are counseled by our leaders, to use it as 
		frequently as circumstances allow.&nbsp; <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		In Summary:<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		First: &nbsp;Take advantage of every opportunity you have to learn the 
		gospel. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Second: &nbsp;Success in your university courses is also very important. 
		Learn all you can, and get the best grades you can <i>honestly</i> get.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Third: &nbsp;Live up to the Lords commandment to love one another and keep 
		yourself morally clean. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Fourth: &nbsp;Decide now that you will not get involved in <i>any</i> form of 
		pornography. <br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Fifth: &nbsp;Decide now that you will always remain active in the Church.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Sixth: &nbsp;Always live your life so you can have a current temple recommend 
		in your possession and use it as frequently as your circumstances 
		permit.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Well, there they are. Six suggestions. &nbsp;If you follow them, you will be 
		happier and more successful in your lives. Ignore them and you will 
		bring misery, failure, and pain to yourselves and sadness to those who 
		love you the most. That really is a promise. <br />

		well as some of the extraordinary characteristics my father 
		exemplifies.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was saddened to hear the 
		news of President Hinckleys passing.&nbsp; My life has been blessed because 
		I have known President and Sister Hinckley and their large, extended 
		family.&nbsp; They are choice people.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me share with you one 
		homey little story that illustrates the mutual association the 
		Hinckley and Monson families have shared.&nbsp; You may have learned by now 
		that my father enjoys pigeons and chickens.&nbsp; When Elder Richard 
		Hinckley, President Hinckleys oldest son, served as mission president 
		of the Utah Salt Lake City Mission, their mission home was located on 
		the street right behind my parents home.&nbsp; When the Monson chickens were 
		laying well, my mother would gather several of the eggs and take them to 
		the mission home.&nbsp; Sister Jane Hinckley would express her thanks, and 
		then she would make a baked custard dessert, using those same eggs.&nbsp; 
		Shed walk the dessert through the gate and deliver it to my 
		parentswhich they greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if that was 
		why my parents took eggs to the Hinckleys in the first place, as they 
		loved receiving Sister Jane Hinckleys custard.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I imagine that each of us 
		assembled here today remembers how he or she learned the news of 
		President Hinckleys passing.&nbsp; For me, it was at 8 oclock on that 
		Sunday evening. I was walking up my parents driveway, anticipating our 
		usual Sunday visit.&nbsp; Only this time, I felt the impression that 
		something had changed.&nbsp; I walked in the front door of my parents home, 
		the same home where I grew up, and my niece Laurie shared the sad news.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As a family, we watched the 
		news report on television.&nbsp; My father commented, Im sure that 
		President Hinckley is greeting Jim right now (meaning President Faust).&nbsp; 
		Its hard to believe that both are now on the other side.&nbsp; That was a 
		tender moment for me as I sensed the great affection President Hinckley, 
		President Faust, and my father shared because of their years of service 
		together.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I hope you all watched 
		President Hinckleys funeral.&nbsp; Im sure he was pleased with each of the 
		talks and the beautiful music. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Monday after the funeral, 
		I attended the news conference with my mother. There I learned the 
		Quorum of the Twelve Apostles had met in the temple the day before, and 
		my father had been set apart as the 16<sup>th</sup> President of The 
		Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; He had selected as his 
		counselors, President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf.&nbsp; 
		I witnessed that day that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
		Saints is a church of order, revelation, and priesthood authority.

		Christ of Latter-day Saints?&nbsp; Did you listen?&nbsp; Did you sing?&nbsp; Did you

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At the time of my birth, my 
		father served as the bishop of a large, downtown ward in Salt Lake 
		City.&nbsp; A few years later, he served in the stake presidency.&nbsp; When I was 
		four, our family moved to Toronto, Canada, because my father was called 
		to serve as the mission president in the Eastern Canadian Mission.&nbsp; 
		Thats where I started school.&nbsp; My fathers church service and his 
		callings were a normal part of our familys everyday life.&nbsp; When I was 
		nine years old, Dad was called to be an Apostle.&nbsp; I couldnt see how 
		this was any different than his other callings, but my fourth grade 
		teacher, Mrs. Anderton, was very impressed.&nbsp; And if Mrs. Anderton was 
		happy about my fathers calling, I knew it must be important.&nbsp; Time has 
		passed, and my father has served as an apostle for almost forty-five 
		years, twenty-two of which he has served in the First Presidency. </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sitting in the news 
		conference that announced my father as the prophet, I realized that the 
		event people had been foretelling throughout my life had happened.&nbsp; As 
		strange as this may seem to you, I wasnt prepared.&nbsp; There really is no 
		adequate preparation.&nbsp; Our family never discussed this topic.&nbsp; My father 
		was always an Apostle, a Prophet, Seer and Revelator, and we honored 
		him and sustained him in his service.&nbsp; But we never mentioned or 
		anticipated a time when he would become the President of the Church.&nbsp; In 
		fact, one of the first times I really comprehended how different my 
		fathers responsibility was took place when I was twenty years old, 
		married, and working in North Carolina.&nbsp; A young woman I worked with 
		casually asked, What does your father do?&nbsp; I realized that I had 
		better respond carefully.&nbsp; I answered, Hes an official with the Mormon 
		Church.&nbsp; What would she have thought if I had said, He is an 
		Apostle?&nbsp; What would she think now if I answered, He is the Prophet?</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">My 
		first talk of a doctrinal nature was given in a priesthood meeting and 
		pertained to the Word of Wisdom.&nbsp; I was a deacon and Dad wrote the 
		message.&nbsp; As I read it in a stake priesthood meeting on a Monday evening 
		at the old Pioneer Stake hall, either President Paul C. Child or his 
		counselor, William F. Perschon, leaned over to me and said, That was a 
		fine message, but it will not be necessary for you to read a message in

		took the advice seriously and have never since read a talk.&nbsp; </font>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All the while I was growing 
		up, when general conference was approaching, my father would move the 
		typewriter to the kitchen table, arrange his favorite reference 
		materials close at hand, and then he would type away.&nbsp; We honored his 
		need for quiet time.&nbsp; Hed go downstairs to the basement and practice 
		his talk, checking the time with his stopwatch.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In my opinion, Id say his 
		best talks are those he gives at stake conferences or other small 
		meetings, where he just uses an outline and fires away.&nbsp; Those talks 
		come alive with truth, warmth, humor, and testimony.&nbsp; I went to a stake 
		conference in Connecticut where he talked about tithing, inviting a few 
		of the Primary children to come forward and help him. Afterwards, I felt 
		like coming forward and paying my tithing right then and there, on the 
		spot.&nbsp; I thought, My, hes good at this.&nbsp; Of course, hes had some 
		practice, since he has attended stake conferences every weekend for 
		years and years.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Long ago, as a young boy, my

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A month ago, I accompanied my 
		parents on an assignment in San Diego, where my father spoke to the San 
		Diego Temple workers. He reminisced about his experiences in the Navy 
		when stationed in San Diego.&nbsp; As he shared his stories, I recognized 
		that this was a time when, as a young man, he chose to stand firm 
		against every temptation of the adversary.&nbsp; He had just had his 18<sup>th</sup> 
		birthday, and he had met my mother at the University of Utah just prior 
		to his leaving.&nbsp; He chose to stand tall, and sometimes alone, and be 
		numbered as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. He did not visit 
		Tijuana with the other young men; he did not swear or gamble; he obeyed 
		the Word of Wisdom; he did his work well; he attended church; he 
		attended the special firesides and activities the members provided for 
		the Latter-day Saint servicemen.&nbsp; He honored and used his priesthood.&nbsp; 
		He made the choice to keep the Lords commandments. Because he did so, 
		and has continued to do so, he has qualified for the companionship of 
		the Holy Ghost, and he has received the promised blessings.&nbsp; </font></p>

		opportunity to study and learn at a university.&nbsp; Yet, my father said Ed 
		always had the scriptures open by his reading chair.&nbsp; He went to work at

		street department of Salt Lake City doing manual labor his entire 
		working career.&nbsp; He never married, he never drove a car, and even when 
		he was 90 years old, he would walk everywhere he wentusually about

		hired Ed to help him clean his pigeon coops and do manual chores in our 
		large yard.&nbsp; I must say that I didnt always feel comfortable around 
		Ed.&nbsp; He was a big man, he looked different, and he didnt talk very 
		much.&nbsp; Ed just did his work, ate dinner with us, and then Dad would take 
		him home.&nbsp; This happened several times each year.&nbsp; In later years, when

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dad always enjoys a good

		he made a few comments about boys with red hair.&nbsp; Not long afterwards,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My father grew up in a loving

		from a loving extended family, with aunts and uncles who acted as 
		additional mothers and fathers to their nephew, Tommy.&nbsp; They all lived 
		right next door to one another.&nbsp; When my father was dating my mother, my 
		fathers care of his grandfather became a real selling point in his 
		favor.&nbsp; As a teenager, Dad helped <b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b>groom his grandfather 
		on a regular basis, and he personally gave his grandfather a weekly 
		shave with a Gillette Safety Razor.&nbsp; My mothers mother told her 
		daughter: Any young man who is that kind and helpful to his grandfather 
		will be a good husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was right, and in my book, the way a 
		young man treats his grandparents is still a good measurement of how 
		good a husband he will be.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have grown up always

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A best friend is someone who

		husband, Grandpa called and asked us out on a double date to the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Lastly, and most importantly,

<font color="#000080">Today Id like to share some thoughts about 
			gifts. Im a little sensitive about the topic.&nbsp; My eldest son Joseph 
			was born on my birthday, and is the best birthday gift I ever 
			received.&nbsp; But now for some 22 years my birthday, appropriately, has 
			been lost in his birthday.&nbsp; My wonderful daughter Lauren was born on 
			June 21, which is often Fathers day, so I get a little neglected 
			there as well.&nbsp; Im not complaining, just have a heightened 
			sensitivity regarding gifts.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">This sensitivity about gifts could be traced 
			to my childhood and to having had a very gifted little brother, 
			Gary.&nbsp; I remember watching his room fill up with trophies.&nbsp; As they 
			stacked up on&nbsp; his shelf I wondered, what is my gift?&nbsp; And now, my 
			old college friends make more money, my colleagues are smarter, I 
			cant sing or play the piano, my stab at acting resulted in the 
			unfortunate Taming of the Shrew incident in a theater class wherein 
			I played Petruccio to a Kate who was larger than me.&nbsp; This is 
			Shakespeare so tights were involved.&nbsp; And a slippery floor.&nbsp; Ill 
			say no more.</font></p>

<font color="#000080">But after all these years of searching, I 
			think Ive found it.&nbsp; My gift. If we were in a different setting I 
			would demonstrate it for you.&nbsp; What is my gift?&nbsp; Clapping.&nbsp; I can 
			clap really loud.&nbsp; At guitars unplugged or that concert or play or 
			baseball game, that was me you heard.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">

			worked hard to develop your athletic or musical talents. Thats 
			where I come in.&nbsp; I can show my appreciation for those talents. 
			Where would you be without me?&nbsp; Thats how gifts work together, this

<font color="#000080">The subject of spiritual gifts is so

			remember Article of Faith Seven: We believe in the gift of tongues, 
			prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, 
			and so forth.&nbsp; <i>True to the Faith</i> refers to spiritual gifts as

<font color="#000080">As we lay this foundation, speaking of 
			spiritual gifts, I will just let the word speak for itself, but 
			invite you to think about those settings in your experience, in your 
			wards and families where youve seen these gifts manifest, and how 
			they have blessed your life.&nbsp; As you reflect on your experience, I 
			believe youll sense a tender witness of the truthfulness of the 
			Restoration of the Gospel as you note how readily these gifts are 
			available in the latter-day kingdom. Paul enumerates some of these 
			gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, beginning with verse four: &nbsp;Now there are 
			diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.&nbsp; And there are 
			differences of administration, but the same Lord. And there are 
			diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all 
			in all.&nbsp; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man 
			to profit withal.&nbsp; For to one is given by the Spirit the word of 
			wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.&nbsp; To 
			another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by 
			the same Spirit; To another the working of miracles; to another 
			prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds 
			of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; 
				and that ye may not be deceived seek earnestly the best gifts,

				unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me 
				and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do;

				And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always

<font color="#000080">From Moronis great witness of spiritual gifts

			my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every good gift cometh of 
			Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Summarizing, the points I believe we should be 
			drawn to are:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">1- These gifts, as all good gifts, come 
				from a loving God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">2- These gifts are to help us bless and 
				lift and build one another, and the Kingdom of God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">3- We have different gifts for a reason. 
				They are to be woven together, making us depend on, learn and 
				benefit from, and just think about one another.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">4- Different gifts may be given to us 
				during different seasons as they are needed.&nbsp; For example, 
				bishops will attest to an added measure of the gift of 
				discernmentwhich you know your mothers also enjoy (even if <u>
				you</u> didnt always enjoy it).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Please note the Doctrine and Covenants 
			admonition to seek earnestly the best gifts.&nbsp; To add apostolic 
			admonition to that,&nbsp; Elder Oaks has taught:&nbsp; The scriptures tell us 
			that we should desire and zealously seek spiritual gifts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elder 
			Robert D. Hales counsels: To find the gifts we have been given, we 
			must pray and fast. Often patriarchal blessings tell us the gifts we 
			have received and declare the promise of gifts we can receive if we 
			seek after them. <i>I urge you each to discover your gifts and to 
			seek after those that will bring direction to your lifes work and 
			that will further the work of heaven</i>.</font></p>

<font color="#000080">Noting the importance of spiritual gifts and

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span><font color="#000080">the gift 
			of asking; the gift of listening; the gift of hearing and using a 
			still, small voice; the gift of being able to weep; the gift of 
			avoiding contention; the gift of being agreeable; the gift of 
			avoiding vain repetition; the gift of seeking that which is 
			righteous; the gift of not passing judgment; the gift of looking to 
			God for guidance; the gift of being a disciple; the gift of caring 
			for others; the gift of being able to ponder; the gift of offering 
			prayer; the gift of bearing a mighty testimony; and the gift of 
			receiving the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Elder Ashton emphasized:&nbsp; We must 
			remember that to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. It

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Some examples: think of the gift of knowing 
			when someone needs a boost.&nbsp; I believe thats an expression of the 
			gift of discernment.&nbsp; And Ive seen you invoking that gift, staying 
			after class to talk when you sensed something was wrong with 
			someone, even someone you didnt know very well; That gift is 
			invoked by doing some kindness for a discouraged roommate; stopping 
			and talking to someone when you said how are you doing and you knew 
			he or she wasnt really fine, even though he or she said so and 
			you could have kept on walking.&nbsp; </font></p>

<font color="#000080">Some have the gift of being a friend, of being 
			selfless and thoughtful and lifting those around them.&nbsp; Speaking of 
			the most treasured spiritual gift of charity, Paul in 1 Corinthians 
			13:5 says it seeketh not her own.&nbsp; That certainly means that 
			someone with the gift of charity isnt always looking out for 
			himself or herself, isnt overly concerned with his or her own 
			self-interest.&nbsp; But I learned something of charity from someone with 
			such a gift of friendship.&nbsp; After graduate school we moved to 
			Southern California.&nbsp; We moved in on a Saturday, a call came on 
			Sunday, and on Monday I was surprised to find myself the new 
			early-morning seminary teacher, facing a group of 30 high-school 
			juniors and seniors. &nbsp;They were delightful.&nbsp; As I got to know them I 
			particularly noticed one young man.&nbsp; Everyone wanted to be around 
			him.&nbsp; It was interesting that there was nothing superficially 
			exceptional about him: he didnt have a great car, was not a big 
			athlete. So I observed, and I learned.&nbsp; For example, when most of us 
			go into a fireside, who do we look for? I think we would agree, for 
			our friends, for those with whom were comfortable.&nbsp; Not my friend 
			Sean.&nbsp; Though everyone was saving him a seat, Sean would look for 
			the person who was alone, who needed to have someone to sit by.&nbsp; He 
			was not seeking out his own buddies, not seeking out his own.&nbsp; When 
			you walk into a dance, who do you look for?&nbsp; Well, youll have to 
			answer that one for yourself; but I suspect some of you might have 
			been&nbsp; thinking of physical descriptions of people in the room.&nbsp; My 
			friend Sean was looking for whoever might feel a little lonely or 
			awkward.&nbsp; Seans goal was to see everyone had a good time.&nbsp; He 
			wasnt seeking his own pleasure or gratification, he wasnt seeking 
			his own.&nbsp; And I can tell you his gift had a significant affect, on 
			the love and the unity of our Stake, and a richness came into his 
			life.</font></p>

			Hinckley and Faust would be in attendance.&nbsp; Well, the day was

			bowery, a replica of a crude stick shelter.&nbsp; She was grateful the 
			rain hid her tears.&nbsp; Then came the opening prayer.&nbsp; It was offered

			prayer she said something like, and Heavenly Father, we are

		Because of that influence Ive seen such young men and women do

		Note, too, you may have some vulnerability.&nbsp; Note the difference between 
		Almas two sons: both Shiblon and Corianton appear to have been given

		humility and service helped him to channel those and bless lives, where

<font color="#000080">President Hinckley said many times, and I give you 
		but one example: <em style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Believe in yourselves and in your capacity to do something worthwhile.</em> 
		God has given you a mind and a spirit and a body with which to do your 
		work. You have tremendous capacity. You do not have to be a genius to do 
		something worthwhile in the world. The major work of the world is done 
		by ordinary people who have learned to work in an extraordinary way. 
		This is what makes the difference. Stand tall and look sharp and bright 
		with a smile on your face, and you will find that people will love and 
		honor and respect you.&nbsp; Consider Elder Neal A. Maxwells words on the 
		subject, In a world filled with much laboring and striving in 
		parliaments, congresses, agencies, and corporate offices, Gods 
		extraordinary work is most often done by ordinary people in the seeming 
		obscurity of a home and family.&nbsp; Winston Churchill said, &nbsp;To every man 
		[and woman] there comes that special moment when he is figuratively 
		tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a special thing 
		unique to him and fitted to his special talent.&nbsp; What a tragedy if that 
		moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for the work which would be 
		his finest hour.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">It may surprise you when your gifts come to be 
		used.&nbsp; I love an Old Testament example, that of Bezaleel and Aholiab. 
		The children of Israel have been delivered from Egypt, but theres so 
		much they need to become who they can be.&nbsp; God has chosen to bless them 
		with the sanctuary and goes into great detail on just how it is to be 
		built (many of you have been through the Rexburg Temple, think of the 
		beautiful detail you saw, all with the purpose of pointing you to 
		God).&nbsp;&nbsp; God then mentions Bezaleel in Exodus 35:30-32: And he hath 
		filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in 
		knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship.&nbsp; And to devise curious work 
		in gold and silver and in brass.&nbsp; It goes on to include Aholiab in 
		verse 35: Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner 
		of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the 
		embroiderer . . . even of them that do any work, and of those that 
		devise cunning work.&nbsp; I wonder if that even took them by surprise.&nbsp; Who 
		would have thought that former slaves now driven into a difficult and 
		forbidding desert would be able to use their gifts of fine workmanship 
		to glorify God.&nbsp; It reminds me of the early Saints, impoverished 
		Englishmen who are expert woodworkers and stonecutters, who join the 
		Church, journey to a difficult and forbidding desert in the West, and 
		are able to pour their hearts through their hands into the work of the 
		Salt Lake Temple. Theres a special spirit in the Salt Lake Temple 
		because of the consecrated offering of those saints.&nbsp; Another great 
		example many of you witnessed, in our own Rexburg Temple, and the 
		careful construction workers, tile and stone and wood workers, and BYU-I 
		faculty members Bro Parsons, Bro Griffin and others.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">As weve been thinking of&nbsp; President&nbsp; Hinckley 
		these past few weeks, Ive noted how he certainly viewed himself as 
		ordinary, how a mission was fairly miraculously provided him by the 
		saving of his mother and the encouragement of his father, how on that 
		mission he developed some communications skills that then are used and 
		honed as he is employed by the Church, how carefully he was prepared to 
		do the marvelous service he gave to the kingdom.&nbsp; Think of the unique 
		preparation of President Clark, raised up and gifts polished for this 
		time in BYU-Idaho history.&nbsp; I believe if you put yourself in Gods hands 
		you will find that.&nbsp; It may well surprise you how God will put to use 
		your gift for organization, art, music, caring about the youth, sports; 
		Im stretching my mind to think how he might even use your highly honed 
		X-box skills.&nbsp; </font></p>

<font color="#000080">I hope youll forgive a personal example, one that 
		took me by surprise.&nbsp; God gave me and brought together two gifts. 
		Through my mission to Mexico I gained a great love for my people, the 
		people of Mexico.&nbsp; Through the sacrifices of my parents and my wife, and 
		a whole lot of hours logged in the library, I gained a good education in 
		International Business.&nbsp; I had visions of globe trotting, of stepping 
		off planes in exotic locations (that vision always includes me carrying 
		an expensive briefcase).&nbsp; God had different plans, and I never quite 
		understood why I was guided to that area of study and how I might use 
		what I learned there.&nbsp; Until some 14 years after graduation, and a Ricks 
		College sponsored program to bless the lives of returned missionaries in 
		Mexico.&nbsp; I was just a tiny cog. There were much more significant 
		contributions made through the gifts of President Eyring, President 
		Bednar, Don Bird, Leo Castagno, Dale Mortenson, Bro. Max Checketts, my 
		friends Emilio, Rodolfo and Josafat, but I was able to use my small 
		offerings to sort of be the stitching that held together their more 
		important gifts in a program that went on to bless and change some 400 
		lives, and continues today.&nbsp; It took me by surprise, and has been one of 
		the great blessings of my life just to be a part. </font></p>

		what you will need to know. He is kind and He is all-knowing. So, you 
		can with confidence expect that He has prepared opportunities for you to 
		learn in preparation for the service you will give. You will not 
		recognize those opportunities perfectly, as I did not. But when you put 
		the spiritual things first in your life, you will be blessed to feel 
		directed toward certain learning and you will be motivated to work 
		harder. You will recognize later that your power to serve was increased,

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Before I mention the most important gifts, a word 
		on giving back we too must give.&nbsp; We show our appreciation for His 
		gifts by accepting them. And we probably should more directly, 
		frequently, and even creatively think of ways to thank Him for all weve 
		been given.&nbsp; You know how it is when youve been given a gift, your 
		response is to want to give something back.&nbsp; There is that something in 
		us that wants to give something back to God.&nbsp; But what do we give this 
		glorious being?&nbsp; What gift can we give the Master of ocean, earth and 
		skies and the God of the universe?&nbsp; Elder Neal A. Maxwell said it so 
		typically well, &nbsp;The submission of one's will is placing on God's altar 
		the only uniquely personal thing one has to place there. The many other 
		things we give are actually the things He has already given or loaned 
		to us. However, when we finally submit ourselves by letting our 
		individual wills be swallowed up in God's will, we will really be giving 
		something to Him! It is the only possession which is ours to give.&nbsp;

<font color="#000080">The gift he wants back would be first, your will.

<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">First, you can see how so much of what weve 
		talked about comes through the Spirit.&nbsp; A search of gifts in the 
		scriptures shows how often the gift of revelation is referred to.&nbsp; You 
		can tell what God values by where He puts His emphasis, and thus we see 
		that God prizes that gift.&nbsp; That gift of the Holy Ghost, of the ability 
		to receive revelation is the greatest day-to-day gift weve been given 
		in this life.&nbsp; Among Nephis final words to us in 2 Nephi 32:5&nbsp; are the 
		great statement that  . . .&nbsp; If you will enter in by the way and 
		receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should 
		do.&nbsp; We should be reminded that both President Brigham Young and 
		President Boyd K. Packer, speaking of the gift of revelation, have told 
		us we live far beneath our privileges, and therefore far beneath our 
		potential. </font></p>

<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;I think of the splitting of a family in 2 Nephi 5 
		and of who followed Nephi and became Gods people: those who believed in 
		the revelations.&nbsp; I think of Nephites being led away and saved by a 
		righteous king in the book of Omni, and of those who would follow him to 
		safety: those who believed in revelation.&nbsp; We read of Jacob, in Jacob 7, 
		being assailed by an anti-Christ, as we know there well be in our day, 
		and what kept him safe, that fact that he had become unshaken because of 
		his many revelations.&nbsp; We read of Enos and what would lead to a powerful 
		testimony of Christ and blessings secured for those he cared about 
		through his becoming unshaken in revelation.&nbsp; I think of you, of what 
		you will face, of the amazing days ahead, of you being righteously 
		scattered around the world and what will keep you safe and unshaken. 
		Surely that will be revelation.&nbsp; And that will come as it has always 
		come, quietly, line upon line, as you quietly study your scriptures, 
		pray, serve, and just put one foot in front of the other in what may 
		seem ordinary but faithful ways.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">President Eyring shares in this months <i>Ensign</i>: 
		&nbsp;There are two great keys to inviting the Spirit to guide what words we 
		speak as we feed others.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the daily study of the scriptures 
		and the prayer of faith.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost will guide what we say if we 
		study and ponder the scriptures every day. The words of the scriptures 
		invite the Holy Spirit . . . . Just as pondering the scriptures invites 
		the Holy Ghost, so does daily pleading in prayer. If we do not ask in 
		prayer, He will rarely come, and without our petition, He is not likely 
		to linger.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<font color="#000080">Now, finally, in a crescendo, we will close 
		speaking of The Gift. This one is incomparable. It is that God so loved 
		the world that He gave his only Begotten Son.&nbsp; It is that the Son so 
		loved us that He laid down His life in a personal, unfathomable, truly 
		amazing way.&nbsp; There is no gift to compare to the gift of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 
		That gift makes every good thing and every good gift really, genuinely 
		possible.&nbsp; Paul said to the Corinthians (2 Cor. 9: 15): Thanks be unto 
		God for his unspeakable gift.&nbsp; And the last sentence of The Living 
		Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles, God be thanked for the matchless 
		gift of His divine Son.&nbsp; And the words of President Hinckley: God be 
		thanked for the gift of His Beloved Son, our Savior, the Redeemer of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Introduction </b></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Clark is taking a 
		real risk inviting me to speak in another BYUIdaho devotional.&nbsp; The 
		last time I gave a devotional here, the Spori Building burned down a few 
		hours later.&nbsp; Though that was probably not my fault, President Clark has 
		likely alerted all the fire departments for several counties aroundjust 
		as a precaution, of course.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As one who often attends 
		conventions and seminars with other deans, I can tell you that President 
		Kim Clark was an enormously well-respected dean of the Harvard Business 
		School before President Hinckley asked him to take over the post at the 
		head of this wonderful institution. He and his colleagues have assembled 
		a remarkable group of talented and inspired faculty and administrators 
		and attracted a superbly well-prepared student body to this school. 
		Because of who you are and the education you are receiving here, the 
		world will surely be a better place. I congratulate all of you.&nbsp; You are 
		a large part of the reason that, in my travels to visit business and 
		educational leaders around the world, the qualities found by applying 
		the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ are becoming more and more 
		positively recognized and sought after.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Clark has suggested 
		that I address a difficult but vital topichow to listen to the voice of 
		the Spirit, how to receive personal revelation, or how to be sensitive 
		to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. This is so important for you to 
		understand because during these relatively few years, you are facing so 
		many of lifes pivotal decisions; such as, education, missions, 
		marriage, careers, where to live, decisions about families. The choices 
		you make now will form the foundations upon which you will build the 
		structure that will be your mortal life on this earth. How important it 
		is to have help from heaven during this time. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Like you, I have often asked, 
		What is the will of the Lord for me?&nbsp; How do I get answers to my 
		prayers?&nbsp; How do I discern between the Spirits voice and purely 
		emotional feelings?&nbsp; When I make mistakes, how do I know when I am 
		forgiven? Fortunately, we have a loving Heavenly Father who, with his 
		Son, created us and sent us here to the earth to allow us to grow and 
		make choices, to test us to see if we would determine to follow His Son, 
		and to experience the joys and the sorrows of mortality. He gave this 
		assurance to his disciples as he taught them during the last hours 
		before the crucifixion: But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, 
		whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and 
		bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
		<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup> When we speak of listening for the 
		voice of the Spirit, we are speaking of listening for the promptings of 
		the Holy Ghostthis member of the Godhead whose responsibility it is to 
		teach, testify, recall to remembrance, comfort, buoy up, and bring peace 
		to our souls. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In fact, each week, the young 
		priest at the sacrament table utters a prayer on our behalf, that they 
		may always have his Spirit to be with them. How do we have the Spirit 
		of the Holy Ghost with us constantly and recognize His voice?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I must caution you at the 
		outset that there are no easy formulas. But perhaps some of the 
		observations and suggestions we discuss today may help us enjoy more of 
		the Spirits direction in our lives.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A simple analogy will help 
		guide our discussion. My hobby, going back to when I was 10-years-old, 
		is birdingyou might call it bird watching. I dont call it that 
		because I spend much of my time in the field not watching but carefully 
		listening. I can usually hear more birds in a wood than I can ever see.&nbsp; 
		One of my favorite birding activities is to take people out at night (or 
		in the very early morning) to find owls. Owls are actually fairly common 
		but most people have never seen one in the wild because owls are 
		nocturnal. However, we can sometimes attract an owl into view by making 
		the sound of an owl with our voice or with a recording. One night, for 
		example, I took a group of 8-10 year-old Cub Scouts with their leaders 
		to a wooded area.&nbsp; With the promise that they might see a real owl, I 
		asked them to be exceptionally quiet. No talking, no whispering, no feet 
		shuffling, no movement at all. (Can you imagine Cub Scouts being that 
		quiet?) Then I played the call of a Western Screech Owla very soft, 
		bouncy call. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The scouts were very quiet. 
		After playing the call for a few more minutes, we listened in silence. 
		But, it was not really complete silencewe could hear the growl of large 
		trucks on the distant freeway, the barking of dogs, the sound of a jet 
		plane, the whirring of electrical machinery, the noise of a police 
		siren. &nbsp;It is surprising how much noise surrounds useven at night. 
		Finally my ears picked up the very soft but distant call of a small owl. 
		The boys and their leaders could not hear this sound at first amid all 
		the other competing sounds of the night. I played the recording again; 
		the owl flew closer and called a bit nearer. Soon they could all hear 
		the soft sound. Then, a shadow silently crossed the night sky and landed 
		in a tree. I shined my flashlight on the little owl. It looked down at 
		us with its large yellow and black eyes. The boys and their leaders were 
		so excitedmost of them had never seen an owl.&nbsp; We watched it for about 
		five minutes and then this treasured little jewel flew away quietly into 
		the night.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What can we learn from this 
		experience of finding an owl on a dark night? The voice of an owl and 
		the voice of the Spirit are both very soft and still and can only be 
		discerned with great effort. As President Henry B. Eyring said, Now, I 
		testify [the voice of the Spirit] is a small voice. It whispers, not 
		shouts. And so you must be very quiet inside. That is why you may wisely 
		fast when you want to listen. And that is why you will listen best when 
		you feel, Father, thy will, not mine, be done. You will have a feeling 
		of I want what you want. Then, the still small voice will seem as if 
		it pierces you.<sup><font size="1">3</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You may recall the remarkable 
		account of Nephi and Lehi preaching to the Lamanites shortly before the 
		birth of the Savior. They were thrown in prison. As the Lamanite guards 
		went to retrieve them to slay them, a voice from heaven was heard. it 
		was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous 
		noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it 
		had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul<sup><font size="1">4</font></sup> 
		How do we learn to listen for that still, small voice of perfect 
		mildness in our dark nights? Let me share with you nine guidelines that 
		may be useful if we desire to be more receptive to the voice of the 
		Spirit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 1: We Must Do 
		Our Homework First.&nbsp; </b>An illustration may help. Many of you will face 
		a decision my wife and I once faced: Which career path is right for us? 
		Specifically, we were trying to decide whether I should go to medical 
		school or return to graduate school to pursue another academic program. 
		To us, this loomed as a large decision in our lives, one that might 
		impact our family significantly for years to come. At the time we had 
		three little boys and I had already been in school at the college level 
		for five years. We were anxious to resolve this great uncertainty in our 
		lives in a way that would let us be serviceable in the kingdom and have 
		a good family life. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We applied the familiar 
		pattern spelled out in the 9<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and 
		Covenants: study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be 
		right.<sup><font size="1">5</font></sup> We made lists of pros and 
		cons, we talked to people in both fields, we talked to family members 
		who knew us best, we talked to our bishop, we talked a lot to each 
		other, and we prayed often. Finally, we felt we had accumulated all the 
		information we could. We realized that doing our homework was a vital 
		part of the processwe could not fairly expect heaven to answer our 
		prayers if we didnt do our part first. We then made a tentative 
		decision based on our best judgment. Then we set a time for us to fast 
		together. During our fast, we prayed earnestly, asking Heavenly Father 
		for divine confirmation of our tentative decision. We sincerely wanted 
		to do what Heavenly Father wanted us to do. After our fast, after our 
		prayers, after our best work, we talked about the promptings we felt 
		that Sunday afternoon. Interestingly, both of us felt a stupor of 
		thought, a darkness, about the tentative decision we had made. It 
		seemed unsettling, the wrong direction for our family. As we considered 
		the alternative decision, we felt a clearness of thought and a peaceful 
		assurance that the alternative decision was the right one for us. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Heavenly Father requires us 
		to do our part. It was never His plan to do work for us that we can 
		possibly do for ourselves. If He did, He would be robbing us of our 
		chance to grow and develop our own decision-making skills. Im guessing 
		that you have found that He does not help us do well on a test for which 
		we neglected to study. And I have some test scores from my undergraduate 
		years to prove it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 2: By Keeping 
		the Commandments We Tune Our Spiritual Receiver.&nbsp; </b>While I dont 
		pretend to understand the physiological mechanism, there is a spiritual 
		receiver within our souls where promptings of the Spirit are felt. 
		President James E. Faust said, How do revelation and inspiration 
		operate? Each person has a built-in receiving set which, when 
		fine-tuned, can be a receiver of divine communication. Said Job, There 
		is a spirit in man: and  the Almighty giveth them understanding.(</font><a target="contentWindow" style="color: #000080; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/job/32/8#8">Job 
		32:8</a><font color="#000080">) <sup><font size="1">6</font></sup> We 
		need to make sure that our receiver is always fine-tuned to the right 
		channel. Can we expect blessings from heaven when our lives are not in 
		harmony with commandments from heaven? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Harold B. Lee said, 
		Some of us fail to live so that we can understand the message that 
		comes from eternity when God speaks, but if each of us could commit 
		ourselves to obey Gods commandments and live as we should, a wonderful 
		change would be effected in us, and we could then hear the messages from 
		the unseen world. <sup><font size="1">7</font></sup> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sin makes our hearts less receptive to the 
		promptings of the Holy Ghost. Nephi told his rebellious brothers: Ye 
		are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have 
		seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from 
		time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye 
		were past <em>feeling,</em> that ye could not <em>feel</em> his words
		<sup><font size="1">8</font></sup>. Because of sin, Lamans and Lemuels 
		receivers were not able to feel and understand the voice of the 
		Spirit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Thankfully, Heavenly Father 
		doesnt require his children to be perfect before He gives us 
		inspiration for He often helps when we are in serious 
		difficultysometimes even when brought on by ourselves. Consider Saul on 
		the road to Damascus and the conversion of Alma the Younger. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 3: Minimize 
		Competition with the Voice of the Spirit. </b>As we learned in locating 
		our little screech owl, we must do all we can to minimize competing 
		soundsto tune them out. &nbsp;I asked the Cub Scouts to not make a sound. 
		We, too, need to reduce the noises that compete with the voice of the 
		Spirit in our lives. Can you think what some of these noises might be? 
		This noise is usually not measured in decibels but by spiritual 
		interference. What factors make you less likely to hear this still, 
		small voice of the Spirit?&nbsp; I can think of some in my life: the spirit 
		of contention, gossiping, criticizing others, loud and profane talk or 
		musicthose draw me away from the Spirit. What about pornography, 
		illicit drug use, materialism, dishonesty, time wasting (such as, 
		excessively playing video games or watching television)? You get the 
		picture. You and I must rid ourselves of anything in our lives that 
		detracts from our ability to hear the voice of the Spirit. Sometimes it 
		only requires something simple. My son said the other day, I found that 
		by turning off the car radio, I could hear the voice of the Spirit more 
		often.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 4: Seek out 
		Places Where the Spirit is More Likely.&nbsp; </b>To find owls I took the Cub 
		Scouts to a place where I knew owls were most likely to be. While I have 
		sometimes seen an owl in an unusual place, we did not look for owls at a 
		shopping mall, in the middle of the ocean, or in a movie theater.&nbsp; Trees 
		are a more likely locationtrees near fields. Likewise, we increase our 
		chances of hearing the Spirits voice if we locate ourselves in places 
		the Spirit is likely to belike a quite room in our home or apartment, 
		in a Holy Temple, in sacrament meeting, in a quiet wood, on a 
		mountainside, or in a book of scripture. Enos sought the Spirit in the 
		solitude of a forest<sup><font size="1">9</font></sup>, Moses retreated 
		to a high mountain<sup><font size="1">10</font></sup>, Joseph knelt in 
		the Sacred Grove. You will find that you can hear the still small 
		voice more easily if you spend more time in quiet, contemplative, 
		peaceful surroundings than in the harsh, loud, contentious environment 
		so often present in the world. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Boyd K. Packer is also interested in 
		birds. He has crafted some of the most life-like carvings of birds I 
		have ever seen. He recounted: I took up wood carving as a means of 
		relaxation. I carved birds and spent many hours on a carvingDuring 
		those hours working with my hands, I pondered on the marvels of 
		creation, and inspiration would flow. As I carved wood, I carved out 
		talks. Carving was restful to me. Sometimes when I got a little stressed 
		and cranky, my wife would say, Well, you had better start another 
		carving.<sup><font size="1">11</font> </sup>Finding solitude in his 
		woodworking shop, he was able to listen carefully for the voice of the 
		Spirit to create some of the most memorable and profound talks given in 
		General Conference. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To find an owl, we must train 
		our ear to hear the voice of an owl.&nbsp; To do this I practice.&nbsp; I have 
		listened to many hours of owl calls on tapes and CDs. I listen until the 
		sounds sink into my mind. Then I try to recognize those sounds in the 
		field.&nbsp; I listen also to similar sounding species so I can distinguish 
		one kind of owl from another. It takes years of practice. &nbsp;But how 
		exactly can we practice listening to the Spirit? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 5: Practice 
		Listening to the Spirits Voice by Serving Others. </b>Joseph Smith gave 
		us a glimpse of how to practice.&nbsp; He taught, A person may profit by 
		noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, 
		when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden 
		strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the 
		same day or soon<sup><font size="1">12</font></sup> In my experience, 
		such flashes of pure intelligence are most often connected with 
		service. Youve probably felt such promptings before. They taste good. 
		They feel pure and right. Someone needs your help. Action is 
		requiredyour action. It is often something very small.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A home teacher I know in our 
		ward was recently sitting at home one evening when the prompting came 
		into his mindGo visit Brother Jones! Now! (And it wasnt even the end 
		of the month!)&nbsp; He acted on that prompting and visited Brother Jones at 
		a critical moment to comfort him.&nbsp; Brother Jones, whose wife had passed 
		away, and some of his family members needed to hear the home teachers 
		testimony of eternal life. That teaching moment, that singular 
		opportunity, may have passed forever if the prompting had not been 
		headed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Dont we all marvel at the 
		inspirational stories President Thomas S. Monson tells of visiting 
		widows, serving the poor, blessing suffering hospital patientseach 
		exemplifying President Monsons personal ministry to bless Heavenly 
		Fathers children? Besides teaching us service, what else do these 
		stories tell us?&nbsp; That when the voice of the Spirit prompts President 
		Monson, he responds. If we respond to those quiet promptings that come 
		to us, I promise we will find that our ability to feel the voice of the 
		Spirit will increase and it will come with more frequency. On the other 
		hand, I fear that if we ignore the promptings, the Spirit will withdraw 
		and prompt us less and less often.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It makes sense that the voice 
		of the Spirit would be more often heard when we serve others. King 
		Benjamin reminds us when ye are in the service of your fellow beings, 
		ye are only in the service of your God.<sup><font size="1">13</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we try in our often feeble 
		ways to assist in helping His children, He will magnify our efforts 
		through the influence of His Spirit. A German woman, a convert to the 
		Church, was in dire medical danger caused by a life-threatening heart 
		ailment. She was driven to the mission home early one morning so she 
		could seek a priesthood blessing from the mission president. However, he 
		was not in town. She turned to his two assistants: You hold the 
		priesthood, you can bless me and I know I will be healed and be able to 
		care for my nine children who need me at home.&nbsp; The elders did not have 
		nearly as much faith as this German sister had, but they had faith that 
		the Lord could magnify them as they served. The elder acting as voice in 
		sealing the anointing reported later that as they laid their hands on 
		the womans head he at first felt shaky and nervous. But gradually 
		ideas, words, instructions and promises began to flow into his mind from 
		the promptings of the Spirit. A beautiful, powerful blessing ensuedone 
		not planned or even thought possible by the elders. Healing occurred as 
		the two elders became instruments in the hands of a loving Heavenly 
		Father to bless that faithful saint. If you want to hear the voice of 
		the Spirit more, serve more.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 6: Practice 
		Listening to the Voice of the Spirit through Scriptures and General 
		Conference. </b>Elder David A. Bednar said, The scriptures, in essence, 
		are a written recording of the voice of the Lorda voice we feel in 
		our hearts more than we hear with our ears. And as we study the content 
		and feel the spirit of the written word of God, we learn to hear His 
		voice in the words we read and to understand the means whereby the words 
		are given to us by the Holy Ghost. These words are not of men nor of 
		man, but of meFor it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they 
		are given by my Spirit unto youWherefore, you can testify that you have 
		heard my voice, and know my words. (</font><a target="contentWindow" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/18/34-36#34"><span style="color: #000080">D

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Similarly, we can practice 
		recognizing the voice of the Spirit by listening carefully to General 
		Conference.&nbsp; May I suggest that we dont just listen with our ears but 
		that we also write down the <b>impressions</b> that come into our minds 
		as we prayerfully listen. We might do the same with scripture reading, 
		sacrament meeting, or any other time where the voice of the Spirit is 
		present. If we notice promptings of the Spirit by writing them down, 
		these promptings will come more often and we will improve our ability to 
		recognize them.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A newly called stake 
		president sought inspiration for a serious challenge he faced in his 
		stake. As he read the New Testament one morning, inspiration came into 
		his mind on how to solve the problem. Interestingly, the inspiration had 
		no direct relationship to the content of the passages he was reading 
		that morning. But dont you think that when our hearts and minds are 
		tuned to understanding the voice of the Spirit through the scriptures 
		our receiver is better able to hear the voice of the Spirit about a 
		concern in a stake? Or a possible eternal relationship? Or a mission? Or 
		a career path? Or a family challenge? </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 7: Learn to 
		Differentiate the Spirits Voice from Imitators. </b>When listening for 
		birds, we must be very careful to not be fooled. Some birds can sound 
		like other birds. A Blue Jay can make a great imitation of a Red-tailed 
		Hawk. &nbsp;I once thought I heard the call of a rare and secretive bird 
		called a Black Railit turned out to be a very common Northern 
		Mockingbird.&nbsp; It takes practice to discern the difference between one 
		bird and a possible imitator. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Boyd K. Packer 
		warned, You should know also that, in addition to static and 
		interference which jam the circuits, there are counterfeit signals. Some 
		have received revelations and heard voices that are put there 
		deliberately by wicked sources to lead astray. You can learn to 
		recognize those and tune them out, if you will. Now, how do you tell the 
		difference? How can you know if a prompting is an inspiration or a 
		temptation? My answer to that must surely expose my great confidence in 
		young people. I believe young people, when properly taught, are 
		basically sensible. In the Church we are not exempt from common sense. 
		You can know to begin with that you wont be prompted from any righteous 
		source to steal, to lie, to cheat, to join anyone in any kind of moral 
		transgression...[Your conscience] will prompt you to know the things 
		that are wrong. Dont smother itIf ever you are confused and feel that 
		you are being misled, go for counsel to your parents, and to your 
		leaders.<sup><font size="1">15</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I suspect we sometimes may be 
		confused because the Spirits voice often touches our emotionssometimes 
		very powerfully. However, not all strongly felt emotions are the voice 
		of the Spirit. Sometimes our fears, our excitement, our pride, our

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I once interviewed a young

		Spirits voice in the matter, there was little for her to do but to 
		marry the young manor so claimed each of the three.&nbsp; Now, she <b>was</b> 
		a very talented, capable and attractive young woman and would have 
		undoubtedly made a wonderful wife for any number of young men. But did

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One test for sorting this 
		out, as President Packer suggested, is to ask the question, Is the 
		prompting I feel in keeping with eternal principles? Here the principle 
		of free agency comes to mind. Would the Spirit give direction to one 
		person that takes the agency away from another person? Perhaps the 
		Spirit did confirm that this was a worthy young woman who would make a 
		good wife. But then each of the three young men attached his own 
		therefore.&nbsp; Therefore you <b>must</b> marry me.&nbsp; With experience and 
		the application of common sense, we can learn to sort out the voice of

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline 8: Avoid 
		Boasting about Spiritual Matters. </b>I dont believe the Lord is 
		pleased when we boast about our spiritual promptings or share them 
		inappropriately. Have you ever noticed that the people who are closest 
		to the Spirit are not those who speak openly or boast about it? To them, 
		receiving revelation in their personal lives is a sacred trust that, if 
		boasted of or talked of inappropriately, will cause the Spirit to 
		withdraw. &nbsp;I have heard some membersoften innocentlysay, The Spirit 
		told me this, or The Spirit told me that. When one truly hears the 
		voice of the Spirit, the person recognizes this is sacred communication 
		that is not to be shared lightly. Perhaps we should take a lesson from 
		Mary, the mother of the Savior, who, rather than boasting of her 
		remarkable experiences, kept all these things, and pondered them in

		explained: Often He withholds an answer, not for lack of concern, but 
		because He loves usperfectly. He wants us to apply truths He has given 
		us. For us to grow, we need to trust our ability to make correct

		considered all the pros and cons. To my surprise, I felt inspiration 
		comebut not in the form I had desired. I remember the distinct feeling 
		in my heart, Whose wife is she going to be? Ah, mine. Then it is <b>
		your</b> responsibility to make the choice! When I accepted that 
		answer, I felt the peaceful assurance that if I were making a serious 
		mistake, the promptings from the Spirit would come. I also learned that

		He can assist us in finding peace in our hearts, in knowing the 
		truthfulness of His Gospel, in making crucial decisions, in rendering 
		effective service, and in ultimately returning to our Father. I testify 
		that His prophets and apostles are upon the earthand that President 
		Thomas S. Monson is His prophet today. I testify that Joseph Smith is a 
		prophet of God, that the <i>Book of Mormon</i> is true, that families 
		can be forever, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our Savior

		just wanted some attention).&nbsp; So, we purchased different colors of 
		bright, fluorescent socks and, instead of wearing matching pairs, we 
		would wear one color on one foot and another on the other.&nbsp; This was a 
		time when teenagers were wearing jeans that were much shorter than today 
		(we called them floods) so our fashion statement was quite apparent to 
		all we met.&nbsp; This interesting new style seemed fun and innocent to us, 
		but the bishop of our ward felt differently. He invited us into his 
		office one Sunday morning and taught us that our appearance matters, 
		that our unique taste in footwear was inappropriate, particularly while 
		administering the sacrament. &nbsp;The bishop then educated this small band 
		of priests by telling us how distracting our dress was and that it 
		detracted from the spirit and sacred nature of that ordinance.&nbsp; How 
		could we or others in attendance feel the reverence that must pervade 
		such a setting?&nbsp; Im happy to report that we promptly complied, even

		washcloth, put it under the faucet, and then generously coated it with 
		soap. She said, Well have to wash out your mouth. She told me to open 
		it, and I did so reluctantly. Then she rubbed the soapy washcloth around 
		my tongue and teeth. I sputtered and fumed and felt like swearing again, 
		but I didnt. I rinsed and rinsed my mouth, but it was a long while 
		before the soapy taste was gone. In fact, whenever I think of that

		We also need to be careful using sarcasm.&nbsp; For years I used sarcasm

		to know that there is always truth in sarcasm and it is always negative 
		and destructive to the one using it as well as to the one being 
		targeted. So, if we are not aware, our joking around becomes irreverent, 
		can hurt others and can affect the reverent heart. For instance, sarcasm 
		has become such a fundamental part of news articles, conversation on TV, 
		in movies, on the radio and in everyday dialogue.&nbsp; Sarcasm may be 
		humorous to some, but to those who are the object of such conversation, 
		feelings are hurt and relationships strained. &nbsp;&nbsp;Peter B. Rawlins wrote:&nbsp; 
		Though often meant to be harmless, sarcasm denotes insensitivity to the 
		feelings of others, stemming either from thoughtlessness or 
		maliciousness. Recall the perverted brand of humor of the soldiers who 
		mocked our Savior by putting a crown of thorns on his head, clothing him 
		in a purple robe, and saying, Hail, King of the Jews! (</font><span style="color: black"><a target="contentWindow" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/john/19/2-3#2"><span style="color: #000080">John

		President Thomas S. Monson shared at President Hinckleys funeral.&nbsp; He 
		related an experience he observed during the cold times of the year.&nbsp; 
		Every Thursday morning the members of the First Presidency and the 
		Twelve hold a meeting in the Salt Lake Temple. They ride in carts from 
		the underground parking lot to the underground entrance of the temple.&nbsp; 
		President Hinckley would always wear a hat and coat during these winter 
		months.&nbsp; As they reached a certain point, President Hinckley always 
		seemed to know when they had reached the sacred precincts under the 
		temple. &nbsp;He would then quietly remove his hat and put it in his lap.&nbsp; He 
		obviously had a deep feeling of reverence for the Lord and His holy 
		house.&nbsp; This is a prime example where actions speak louder than words.&nbsp;
		</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Think of times when reverence has most 
		affected your behaviorperhaps witnessing the birth of a baby, at the 
		death of a loved one, while giving or receiving a priesthood blessing, 
		when someone was baptized that you were instrumental in their conversion 
		or while viewing a particularly beautiful sunset.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">When our last grandchild was born, 
		Sister Swain and I were invited in for the delivery.&nbsp; When our 
		daughter-in-laws siblings came to the hospital to see their sister and 
		first niece, they were all so quiet and reverent.&nbsp; Each one seemed to 
		sense that something was different about that occasion, that it was 
		sacred.&nbsp; They all spoke in hushed tones and no one had asked them to.&nbsp; 
		Maybe the same hush and reverence occurred as the shepherds entered the 
		stable where the Christ Child was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">At the passing of my wifes father, we 
		all experienced some sweet moments of deep reverence and quiet feelings 
		of respect.&nbsp; Those feelings of reverence were most deeply felt for me 
		during the time that we had the privilege of dressing his body in sacred 
		apparel.&nbsp; I had never seen our sons more solemn, quiet and reverent.&nbsp; 
		The Spirit settled into that room in a powerful and 
		never-to-be-forgotten experience.&nbsp; We were each affected in our hearts 
		and will never be the same.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">We all seem to have a special awareness 
		of occasions when reverence is required.&nbsp; As we grow in reverence, that 
		awareness will increase and the need for solemnity will be more easily 
		recognized.</span></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Prayer is a time when reverent behavior is 
		imperative.&nbsp; We get a glimpse of that behavior in the following quote 
		from President Monson.&nbsp; Will you join me as we look in on a typical 
		Latter-day Saint family offering prayers unto God. Father, mother, and 
		each of the children kneel, bow their heads, and close their eyes.</font><span style="color:black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">15</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		Why do we bow our heads when we pray?&nbsp; Why do we often kneel when we 
		pray?&nbsp; Why do we close our eyes, fold our arms or hands, remove our hats 
		and speak in hushed tones while we pray?&nbsp; These, of course, are all 
		outward manifestations of inward feelings of reverence for our Father in 
		Heaven and His Son.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">
		President Spencer W. Kimball observed:&nbsp; True reverence is a vital 
		quality, but one that is fast disappearing in the world as the forces of 
		evil broaden their influences. We cannot fully comprehend the power for 
		good we can wield if the millions of members of Christs true church 
		will serve as models of reverent behavior.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">16</span></font></span></span></p>

		in our fun, reverence is forgotten and the Spirit is grieved and

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">There are many blessings that come when a 
		heart fills with reverence.&nbsp; Some of these would include an increase in 
		personal peace, an enlargement of faith, a greater love for others, a 
		growing sense of gratitude, a heightening of humility, a rise in 
		receiving and recognizing personal revelation and an overall increase in 
		righteousness.&nbsp; In fact, it occurs to me that reverence is inseparably 
		connected with peace, faith, love, gratitude, humility and certainly 
		with revelation.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font color="#000080">
		Elder Boyd K. Packer has taught:&nbsp; Revelation and reverence are 
		inextricably combined. &nbsp;You will not in irreverence receive much 
		revelation.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">18</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Furthermore, the Prophet 
		Joseph Smith explained that:&nbsp; No man can receive the Holy Ghost without 
		receiving revelations. The Holy Ghost is a revelator.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">19</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If reverence invites 
		revelation and no man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving 
		revelation, then it would seem to follow that we cant receive the Holy 
		Ghost unless were reverent!&nbsp; If for no other reason than to invite the 
		Spirit into our lives, we should diligently strive to become more 
		reverent. &nbsp;&nbsp;We receive direction from the Lord through a pure source 
		which flows directly into our spirit as Spirit communicates with 
		spirit.&nbsp; More than once prophets have said that we live far below our 
		privileges.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">20</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		If I understand this statement correctly, it means that we are not 
		receiving revelation as we might otherwise because we are not doing or 
		becoming what the Lord expects of us.&nbsp; A major reason we live far below 
		our privileges in receiving revelation just may be due to our lack of 
		reverence.&nbsp; There must be no doubt that to receive the delicate and 
		quiet whisperings of the still, small voice one must be reverent.&nbsp; Not 
		necessarily that the Lord withholds revelation from us but that we, 
		through our irreverence, cannot feel the soft impressions that it would 
		be our privilege to experience.&nbsp; Pause and think of the last time you 
		felt the Spirit or when you were inspired or impressed by 
		somethingmaybe in a sacrament meeting, maybe while you prayed or during 
		a class here on campus.&nbsp; Was there a sense of reverence there?&nbsp; Again, 
		reverence and revelation cannot be separated.</font></p>

		to help us only in our emergencies. We should remember the Most High day 
		and nightalwaysnot only at times when all other assistance has failed 
		and we desperately need help. If there is any element in human life on

		opportunity to be a senior resident on the top floor of the Rigby Hall 
		on the north end.&nbsp; As a senior resident, I had a room all to myself.&nbsp; 
		One night as we met as a ward, our stake president spoke to us.&nbsp; He 
		challenged us to pray for 15 minutes that night in our personal prayer.&nbsp; 
		He asked us to actually have a clock where we could see it to help us 
		keep track of how long we had prayed.&nbsp; After we had prayed as long as we 
		could, if we looked up and the 15 minutes hadnt expired, he encouraged 
		us to continue praying and to repeat the process until we had prayed for 
		a full 15 minutes.&nbsp; I accepted his challenge.&nbsp; Please know that I was a 
		returned missionary at this time.&nbsp; I started to prayI prayed everything 
		that had ever come to mind in previous prayers and then said everything 
		I could remember my parents saying in our family prayers.&nbsp; It felt like 
		30 minutes had passed.&nbsp; I hesitantly looked up at the 
		clocksurprisingly, only 5 minutes had gone by.&nbsp; So, I prayed longer, 
		trying to think of more to speak with our Heavenly Father about that 
		hadnt been said.&nbsp; I looked up again only to discover I had 7 minutes to 
		go.&nbsp; Finally, the prayer began to come from the deepest parts of my soul 
		and tears began to stream down my face.&nbsp; The reason for the challenge 
		from our stake president became clearhumility and reverence had 
		replaced the oftimes casual, brief and superficial prayers that had 
		become too common in my life.&nbsp; I learned a great lesson that nightfor 
		prayer to get past the ceiling, reverence and sincerity are required and 
		as we pray in this fervent manner, we will begin to grow in reverence 
		and in our ability to communicate with the Lord.&nbsp; Please dont think Im

		</span>The fourth recommendation is to try to slow down in this 
		fast-paced world we live in allowing time to meditate. I remember trying 
		to get all of the fun and sociality in that was possible while attending 
		Ricks College before leaving on a mission.&nbsp; I tried to do much more than 
		was possiblebeing away from home without parental constraints really 
		accentuated this problem.&nbsp; I tried to be involved in everything.&nbsp; </span>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="color: #000080">Did any of you 
		have a hamster when you were young?&nbsp; Did you have a wheel for your pet 
		that would allow the little guy to get needed exercise?&nbsp; Too many of our 
		lives are like being on a hamster wheel.&nbsp; Round and round we go trying 
		to accomplish or find something but never seem to find what were 
		looking for.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="color: #000080">While driving 
		to Las Vegas recently to visit our children there, we noticed some homes 
		in the rural areas of Utah that were far away from other homesthey were 
		isolated.&nbsp; We commented on how lonely it must be living in those homes.&nbsp; 
		But, they are definitely away from the hustle and bustle of the world 
		and the inhabitants of those secluded dwellings probably moved there for 
		that purpose.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="color: #000080">To free 
		ourselves of the ill-affects of this harried world, we must take time to 
		relax and ponder.&nbsp; College students like you are so busy with school 
		work that it will take concentrated effort to find this important 
		timetime to meditate may only be found among the moments of leisure, 
		but it can be done, especially by turning off the television and the 
		music.&nbsp; Meditation requires some sense of solitude.&nbsp; The promise is that 
		meditation and pondering on the eternal things of life will allow 
		reverence to take root and grow within us.&nbsp; </span></p>

		With anything in our lives, we must be cautiousSatan loves to encourage 
		us to take anything to the extreme.&nbsp; Remember Elder Packers warning 
		regarding forcing spiritual things.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; Do not be impatient to 
		gain great spiritual knowledge. Let it grow, help it grow, but do not 
		force it or you will open the way to be misled.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">27</span></font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp;

		Lord and His children with exceptional effectiveness and will invite 
		revelation into their lives to such a degree that fear and doubt will no

		Several years ago I, along with some colleagues from campus, decided we 
		would go for a hike in Yellowstone Park.&nbsp; It was a challenging hike; we 
		had to ford three rivers that were very cold.&nbsp; It took almost all day, 
		but we achieved our goal and witnessed Union Falls when large amounts of 
		water were cascading over the crest of the mountain.</span></p>

		This was the beginning of a great series of adventures.&nbsp; Over the last 
		few years, we have hiked several hundred miles together.&nbsp; Last summer we 
		hiked from Old Faithful in West Yellowstone to the Bechler Ranger 
		Station, over 30 miles in one day.&nbsp; But it isnt that hike I would like 
		to talk about.&nbsp; Nearly three years ago in the fall, we decided to go 
		cross country from the Island Park area into Yellowstone Park to Dunanda 
		Falls, where several hot water pools form at the base of the falls.&nbsp; Two 
		of my companions, Brother Bergstrom and Brother Packer accompanied me.&nbsp; 
		We had been conditioned by many hikes throughout the summer.&nbsp; We had a 
		GPS unit, so we knew the location of our destination and where we 
		currently were.&nbsp; Since we were going cross-country, we were not on an 
		established trail or path.&nbsp; A friend had told me about this route to the 
		falls, and I thought I had understood where to begin.&nbsp; But I had 
		misunderstood, and we were actually starting several miles away from the 
		normal place to approach the falls.</span></p>

		It was an overcast day, not exactly warm but in the morning it was 
		pleasant.&nbsp; Because we werent on the path, we had to cross several 
		canyons, ford several streams, climb over numerous deadfall areas in the 
		forest, using muscles we normally do not use.&nbsp; On our journey, we came 
		to marshy areas that we had to walk around to avoid getting mired in the 
		mud and to try to avoid having our socks and shoes become too wet.&nbsp; We

		ate our lunch, and headed back.&nbsp; We decided that given the difficulty of 
		crossing the rough terrain, we would go down the established trail until 
		we reached the closest point to travel cross country to our pickup 
		truck.&nbsp; As we went down the trail, we noticed how much easier it was 
		when you followed in the footsteps of those who had gone before.&nbsp; We 
		made great time, and by early afternoon we were at the point where we 
		needed to start going cross country.&nbsp; As we left the trail, it started 
		to rain and eventually to snow.&nbsp; Remember, we still had our GPS unit and 
		we had logged in the location of our truck to help us find our way 
		back.&nbsp; We continued to go cross country, again being reminded of how 
		difficult it is when you go on your own.&nbsp; We crossed a large meadow, 
		climbed over several ridges, and went to numerous forests again with 
		deadfall. </span></p>

		many trees and no real distinct mountain peaks to navigate by. &nbsp;Our

		I am sure you all realize how torn our world is today between good and

		before has there been so much evil. Revelation 12:7 reminds us that in 
		the pre-mortal world there was a war in heaven--a great battle of words 
		in a war between good and evil. And today that war continues here on 
		earth. The battle for the souls of men and women is intensifying. It is 
		raging in the media and especially on the Internet where the adversary 
		is using every tactic to tempt and weaken Heavenly Father's children and lead 
		them down roads that end in heartache and unmet potential.&nbsp; While there 
		is so very much good, informative information on the Internet, one of 
		Satan's most seductive efforts is the increasingly present pornography 
		appearing in all kinds of media. A 2004 study found that the revenues 
		for pornography exceed the combined revenues of ABC, CBS and NBC. They 
		even surpass the combined revenues of all professional basketball, 
		football and baseball franchises. The result isand this is hard to 
		believe--that every second 28,258 people look for pornography on the 
		Internet. Millions of our Fathers children, our brothers and sisters, 
		are being snared by this filth and sleaze. The destructive results of 
		pornography are incalculable. </span></p>

		So how can you participate? For some of you participation might involve 
		creating, writing, sharing your stories, faith and viewpoints in a blog, 
		in video, or on a social networking site. Or you might simply share what 
		others have written by email or in other venues. Others of you might 
		just comment on blogs or news websites. I'm not necessarily suggesting 
		that you start a blog or website just about the Church. As you reach out 
		to the others online, gospel related topics will naturally arise as an 
		integral part of your life. The greatest impact you have will likely not 
		be among Latter-day Saints but rather will be with Internet users made 
		up of people who share common interests with you.&nbsp; As another member

		to have a different opinion. Just explain your beliefs and share your 
		stories in gentle and loving terms, and you will be a peacemaker in the

		others, even anonymously. Be wise, thoughtful, considerate, and

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The stakes of Zion, the

		which the Lord commands us to stand.&nbsp; Today I would like to emphasize 
		three ways in which we must stand if we are to be disciple-leaders in 
		the kingdom of God: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the years ahead we will 
		live in a world of increasing turmoil, growing temptation, and gathering 
		wickedness.&nbsp; Some of what challenges us will be very subtle; some will 
		be very direct and immediate.&nbsp; But no matter the challenge, the 
		disciples of the Savior will be steadfast and immovable in their 
		commitment to Him.&nbsp; This is what Paul meant when he admonished the 
		Corinthian Saints to stand fast in the faith,</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span></span><font color="#000080">

		wiles of the devil nor his fiery darts.&nbsp; The Lords disciples in the 
		latter-days will be true and faithful to the covenants they have made.&nbsp; 
		They will stand fast.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here are some practical steps 
		you can take to lift up your voice:&nbsp; First, be prepared to share the 
		message of the Restoration with the people you meet.&nbsp; Study and learn 
		the first discussion in <i>Preach My Gospel</i>.&nbsp; Make sure you know the 
		five-minute version very well.&nbsp; Second, ask the Lord to put people in 
		your path, and promise Him that you will speak to them.&nbsp; When He does, 
		share your love of the Church and the gospel. Learn to say something 
		like, I love the way my church gives meaning to my life or brings me 
		closer to God or whatever the Spirit directs.&nbsp; Teach the principles of 
		the first discussion if the opportunity comes.&nbsp; Invite those you meet to 
		read the Book of Mormon, to come to Church, and to visit with the 
		missionaries in your home.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you will pray for 
		opportunities and prepare yourself to share and invite, you will have 
		many wonderful experiences as a witness of God.&nbsp; You will stand up in 
		holy places. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Stand Together</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the Lords kingdom we do 
		not stand alone.&nbsp; Indeed, we are under command of the Lord to stand with 
		our brothers and sisters: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on 
		my name, and worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, <b>should 
		gather together, and stand in holy places . . </b>.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">8</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We gather and stand together 
		in our families and in our wards and stakes.&nbsp; It is in our families that 
		we forge bonds of charity and lay the foundation for eternal life with 
		our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; In our wards and stakes we build faith in the Lord 
		Jesus Christ and strengthen families.&nbsp; We teach and serve one another 
		and succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen 
		the feeble knees.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">9</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So, here are two very 
		practical things you can do to stand together:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, memorize the 
		proclamation on the family and live its principles.&nbsp; Always hold family 
		home evening; always pray together as a family morning and night; always 
		read and study the scriptures together as a family, especially the Book 
		of Mormon; and always work together and have fun together.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Second, always accept and 
		always magnify callings in the Church, and always volunteer to be of 
		service in the kingdom.&nbsp; If your bishop calls you to be the nursery 
		leader, or the Scoutmaster, or anything else, accept and magnify.&nbsp; When 
		opportunities come to volunteer for service, be the first person with 
		your hand in the air, the first person with your name on the sign-up 
		sheet.&nbsp; When the call goes out to shovel the sidewalks, or visit someone 
		less active, or take a meal to a ward member, be the first one to stand 
		up and say, Here am I; send me.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">10</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you do these things, you 
		will stand together in holy places.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In conclusion, I would like 
		to leave you with a request and my testimony. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here is the request: &nbsp;When 
		you leave here today, please take the Spirit of Ricks with you.&nbsp; Please 
		take BYUIdaho and what it means and what it stands for with you.&nbsp; You 
		now represent the university.&nbsp; I hope and pray that wherever you go, 
		whatever you do, you will act in such a way that people around you will 
		see in you the principles, the purposes, and the spirit of BYUIdaho.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, 
		this is the work of our loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; His Son, the Lord Jesus 
		Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; This is His Church and kingdom. We 
		have the great privilege to stand as His disciples in the dispensation 
		of the fullness of times, ushered in through the ministry of the Prophet 
		Joseph Smith.&nbsp; I bear witness that Thomas S. Monson stands where Joseph 
		stood. &nbsp;He is the prophet of God. &nbsp;Your future is bright and glorious.&nbsp; 
		May you stand fast, and stand up, and stand together in holy places and 
		be not moved. &nbsp;In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Welcome!&nbsp; Thank you for coming to 
		devotional today.&nbsp; I am really excited to share a quick thought with you 
		at the beginning of this new semester. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I have been remembering a question I was 
		asked once or twice by my parents.&nbsp; It is a question I have had occasion 
		to ask my own children.&nbsp; Maybe you have heard this from your parents as 
		well. &nbsp;This is the question: &nbsp;What were you thinking?&nbsp; </span></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I remember a specific incident in which 
		I needed to find an answer to that question for my Dad.&nbsp; I had driven 
		the family car to mutual one night.&nbsp; On the 9-mile drive home afterward, 
		I got into a little race with one of my friends.&nbsp; As I sped beyond 100 
		miles per hour to get around her, I heard a little pop on the right side 
		of my car.&nbsp; It drew my attention to the side mirror on the passenger 
		side, but I could see nothing in that mirror.&nbsp; It was pitch black.&nbsp; I 
		knew I should be seeing my friends car in that side mirror as I passed 
		and pulled over in front of her.&nbsp; I checked the rearview mirror.&nbsp; There 
		she was! &nbsp;But the side mirror was still pitch black.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Just then I heard a pop on the left side 
		of my car. &nbsp;I looked to that mirror, to my astonishment, to find it was 
		also pitch black! </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">To make a long story short, the next day 
		I needed to come up with an explanation for the two missing mirrors.&nbsp; I 
		thought my Dad probably knew at what speed side mirrors pop out of their 
		frames, so without going into detail I spoke of the response of our 
		Fords V-8 engine when I needed speed to win the race and said,&nbsp; Those 
		mirrors must have been loose. &nbsp;My Dads response was the question:&nbsp; 
		What were you thinking?</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I dont remember clearly my reply, but 
		in my experience, the best answer to that question has usually been: &nbsp;I 
		was only thinking about the fun. &nbsp;The excitement of the moment 
		controlled my selfish desires for a thrill and a triumphant win!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">What I couldnt see through the 
		excitement was the danger, not just to the car, but to myself and 
		others.&nbsp; It is an example of how losing control of clear thinking can 
		cause us to act in ways that put us in harms way physically.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">But distorted thinking can also put us 
		in harms way spiritually.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In Proverbs, chapter 27, we are 
		counseled that the thoughts of our hearts make us who we are. &nbsp;So, lets 
		ask ourselves the question, &nbsp;What am I thinking?</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In the book of Moroni, chapter 7, Moroni 
		records a speech given by his dad, Mormon, that gives us good advice 
		about thinking clearly in order to avoid spiritual decay.&nbsp; </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">

		and wonderful visions and patterns for our day.&nbsp; One of the most 
		important of those visions is Lehis dream.&nbsp; This dream is about the 
		world and the journey of life, with its mists of darkness, the great and 
		spacious building, the vast multitudes of well-dressed mockers and 
		scorners, the broad and strange roads, and the forbidden paths that lead 
		to destruction and misery.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But the central elements of 
		the dream are the tree of life and its marvelous fruit,</font><span style="color: #000080">
</span><font color="#000080">the strait and narrow path, and the rod of 
		iron.&nbsp; When Lehi partook of the fruit . . . it filled [his] soul with 
		exceedingly great joy.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">1</font></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		Lehis dream is about our search for joy and happiness.&nbsp; It is about the 
		love of God and the joy that is in Christ, in His love and mercy, and in 
		the fruit of His glorious Atonement.&nbsp; It is about the power of obedience 
		that leads to the tree and its fruit, the most desirable above all 
		things</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The focus of my talk today is 
		joy.&nbsp; We will begin by looking at the plain and simple joys of life and 
		the path to the joy of redemption the Savior invites us to walk.&nbsp; We 
		will also talk about the mists of darkness Satan creates and the false 
		joy he uses to deceive us.&nbsp; Then I will share three guideposts we can 
		follow to find the joy of redemption.&nbsp; I hope and pray that the Holy 
		Ghost will teach today what you and I need to do to find joy and 
		happiness, not only here at BYUIdaho, but all through our lives, now 
		and forever. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Joy in the World</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You and I live in a fallen 
		world where we are tried and tested.&nbsp; There is much that is difficult 
		and challenging in the world, but our Heavenly Father loves us so much 
		that He has prepared a world for us in which there is also much joy. 
		&nbsp;Remember:&nbsp; In Lehis dream the tree of life and the precious fruit are 
		in our world.&nbsp; They do not represent the fullness of joy that comes in 
		celestial glory.&nbsp; They represent the joy we might experience in our 
		lives now. &nbsp;Even during life's inevitable trials, we can find joy 
		because of God's love for us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some of that joy comes in the 
		plain, simple blessings of everyday life.&nbsp; There is joy in a kind word, 
		in a beautiful song, in the sunlight on the meadow, in learning truth, 
		in a righteous goal achieved, in feeling the whisperings of the Holy 
		Ghost, in lifting up the hands that hang down, in finding someone who 
		was lost.&nbsp; These are the simple, sweet joys of life; and they are there 
		for us if we will see and feel and experience them.&nbsp; We need to 
		recognize that all of the simple joys of our lives come as gifts of God 
		through His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and are the fruits of 
		His atoning sacrifice.&nbsp; As Mormon taught so long ago, in Christ there 
		should come every good thing.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">4</font></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All of Heavenly Fathers 
		children may experience the plain and simple joys of life because all of 
		His children have the Light of Christ.&nbsp; But these simple joys are only 
		part of the joy that Heavenly Father wants us to experience.&nbsp; I speak of 
		the much greater increase of joy that only comes from being born of God 
		through faith in Christ, repentance, receiving sacred ordinances and 
		covenants, obedience to the commandments of God, and the baptism of fire 
		and the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; I speak of the joy of redemption. Elder Dallin H. 
		Oaks described it this way:</font></p>

<font color="#000080">One of the greatest of all Gods revelations is 
		Father Lehis teaching that men are, that they might have joy (2 Nephi 
		2:25).&nbsp; Joy is more than happiness.&nbsp; Joy is the ultimate sensation of 
		well-being.&nbsp; It comes from being complete and in harmony with our 
		Creator and his eternal laws.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">5</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The joy of redemption 
		is spiritual in nature.&nbsp; It comes from heaven.&nbsp; It comes with remission 
		of sin and brings validation of our eternal identity and purpose and of 
		the perfect love of Heavenly Father and His Son for us.&nbsp; </span>
<font color="#000080">This is the joy of which the king of the Lamanites 
		spoke after Aaron had taught him about redemption and salvation through 
		Christ:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Because this great joy of

		Christ,</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">7</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		it grows in us as we grow in faith, righteousness, and spiritual 
		capacity.&nbsp; The joy of redemption is not an event, but a process of 
		spiritual re-birth that ultimately leads to exaltation in the kingdom of 
		our Father. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The prophets have taught us 
		that we only receive a fullness of joy in celestial glory,</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		but here in mortality we may feel a glimmer of that joy as we take our 
		first steps toward the Savior exercising faith in His redeeming power.&nbsp; 
		If we continue and repent of our sins, we will feel more joy.&nbsp; If we go 
		on and enter into and keep sacred covenants and receive the Holy Ghost 
		in our lives, we will feel even more joy.&nbsp; As our spiritual capacity 
		grows, our capacity to experience that joy grows and deepens. </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Major spiritual events in our 
		lives like baptism, marriage in the house of the Lord, the birth of a 
		baby, or the return of the prodigal son, often bring feelings of joy.&nbsp; 
		But the joy of redemption is not meant to be felt only at major events, 
		nor is joy meant to fade away when the event is past.&nbsp; The Lord intends 
		for us to have it with us and to feel it as a deep, foundational aspect 
		of our lives.&nbsp; Listen to His words in the 50<sup>th</sup> section of the 
		Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp; I have taken the liberty of associating the joy 
		of redemption with light in this passage:</font></p>

		Real spiritual joy is meant to grow and meant to stay if we continue in 
		God.&nbsp; Moreover, when the joy of redemption grows in us, we also grow in

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These are the great blessings

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sister Clark and I have

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joy in this life is a gift

		Lehis dream how we obtain joywe walk the strait and narrow path, hold 
		fast to the iron rod, partake of the fruit, and heed not the scorn and 
		ridicule of the world.&nbsp; As the Prophet Joseph Smith taught:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">[God] has constituted mankind moral agents, and

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is the path of obedience 
		and holiness born of faith nurtured by the Spirit which brings this 
		marvelous gift of joy into our lives.&nbsp; The Lord wants us to keep all of 
		His commandments, learn to do His will, and become more like Him.&nbsp; Elder 
		David A. Bednar taught us the nature of the path when he said:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>Mistake #1: &nbsp;This Cant Be 
		About My Life Now</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first mistake is to be 
		completely overwhelmed, to think that you are so far from what the Lord 
		describes that you could not possibly ever do what He says, certainly 
		not in this life.&nbsp; Or, you might feel that even if it is possible some 
		day, what He describes is so far away, so far in the future, that it 
		really cant have very much to do with your life now.&nbsp; When we make 
		mistake #1, we are basically saying, It is too hard; Im not going to 
		try or to worry about it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><u>

		Lightly the Things We Have Received</u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second mistake is to lay 
		these invitations aside, to treat them as less important.&nbsp; When we make 
		mistake #2, we become like the early Saints described by the Lord in 
		these words: </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we make these two 
		mistakes (and many others I could mention), we deny the power of the 
		Saviors Atonement and fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of mortal 
		life. The Lord does not expect us to do all this alone.&nbsp; His invitation 
		is to be perfected in Him.&nbsp; Nor does He expect us to do it all at 
		once.&nbsp; But He does invite us to follow Him <b>now</b>.&nbsp; He gives us the 
		strait and narrow path<b><u>now</u></b>so that we wont be lost

		strait and narrow path, but over time their hold on the iron rod weakens 
		and their pace slows.&nbsp; They become more casual in their approach to 
		sacred things.&nbsp; In their dress and grooming, in their demeanor, in their 
		attitudes, in their behavior and their language, they become more 
		worldly.&nbsp; The light of the gospel grows dim in their eyes, replaced by 
		the glitz and glamour of the great and spacious building. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In that moment, the great

		exceedingly great</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">27</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		and very powerful, so powerful that they blindeth the eyes, and

		broad roads, that they perish and are lost.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">28</font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		This is no small fog.&nbsp; This is a swirling, rushing, alluring, blinding 
		fog that carries people into paths of destruction. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The mists are very 
		attractive.&nbsp; Satan and all his angels and those he controls and uses do 
		not get us off the path by offering to put us in nasty chains of 
		destruction.&nbsp; They start with flaxen cords that are soft and gentle on 
		the skin.&nbsp; Here is one example of a flaxen cord: &nbsp;<b>false joy.</b>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are all sorts of 
		messages and videos and voices coming at us from the web sites and 
		channels and outlets of the great and spacious building.&nbsp; They offer 
		promises of joy and happiness. &nbsp;It may look like joy in the 
		advertisingit glitters, and shines, and beckonsbut it is counterfeit. 
		The only joy in the great and spacious building is false joy.&nbsp; It may 
		look glitzy on the outside, but on the inside it is hollow, cold, and 
		dark.&nbsp; Listen to words that describe the false joy offered in the great 
		and spacious building: &nbsp;pleasure; lust; entertainment; amusement; 
		thrills; excitement; rush; buzz.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All of these have one thing 
		in common:&nbsp; they are addictive.&nbsp; They are Satans way to trap you with 
		his flaxen cords that become stronger and stronger until he can wrap you 
		in the awful chains of spiritual death and hell. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I could cite so many examples 
		of false joypornography, video games, drugs, and sexual immorality.&nbsp; 
		But I want to use an example that may seem harmless, but is quite 
		deadly.&nbsp; That example is thrill seeking.&nbsp; President James E. Faust 
		warned us against:</font></p>

<font color="#000080">Delirious voices that spawn the desire for a 
		high.&nbsp; I refer not to a drug- or alcohol-induced high, but to the 
		pursuing of dangerous, death-defying experiences for nothing more than a 
		thrill.&nbsp; Life, even our own, is so precious that we are accountable to 
		the Lord for it, and we should not trifle with it.&nbsp; Once gone, it cannot 
		be called back.</font><span style="color: black"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">29</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are people among us who 
		seek thrills by engaging in dangerous, even life- threatening activity.&nbsp; 
		[I hesitate to mention these activities for fear of putting ideas into 
		your minds, but I will continue</font><span style="color: #000080">.]&nbsp; 
		They jump off bridges into shallow rivers full of rocks and unknown 
		currents.&nbsp; They do tricks with flammable gas and fire, and shoot guns at 
		canisters of propane. They </span><font color="#000080">jump into 
		shallow canals and swim near causeways</font><span style="color: #000080"> 
		where the undertow is so violent that even big, strong, experienced 
		swimmers sometimes cannot get out.&nbsp; They ride inner tubes </span>
<font color="#000080">over</font><span style="color: #000080"> river 
		rapids where the turbulence is so powerful that rescuers often cannot 
		save people who get sucked under.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I wish to raise a voice of 
		warning. &nbsp;Anyone who knowingly engages in these kinds of dangerous, 
		thrill-seeking activities runs two life-threatening risks.&nbsp; The first, 
		of course, is the risk of physical death and injury and the consequent 
		pain and heartache and tragic loss that follow.&nbsp; Members of The Church 
		of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who knowingly engage in these 
		life-threatening, thrill-seeking activities put their</font><span style="color: #000080"> 
		period of mortal probation and their </span><font color="#000080">
		physical bodies at great, unnecessary risk.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second is the risk of 
		spiritual injury and, perhaps, spiritual death.&nbsp; Your bodies are the 
		temples of the Holy Ghost.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">30</font></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		When you entered the waters of baptism, when you were confirmed and 
		received the gift of the Holy Ghost, you made sacred covenants of 
		obedience to the Lord.&nbsp; You declared your willingness to take upon you 
		the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You are under covenant to take care 
		of your bodies and use them according to the Lords will and purpose<span style="text-transform: uppercase">.&nbsp;
		</span>You are bought with a price.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">31</font></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		You are bought with the blood of Christ, and your bodies are sacred.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Moreover, these activities 
		are addictive.&nbsp; They cause chemical action in the body and the brain 
		that mimic the effects of illegal drugs.&nbsp; You can lose control of your 
		life and become addicted to thrill seeking. &nbsp;When that happens, your 
		body will not be satisfied with the thrills that got you started.&nbsp; You 
		will be compelled to seek greater and greater thrills and more risk.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, there 
		are much better things to do than to put your spiritual and physical 
		lives at risk.&nbsp; You do not have to break your covenants in order to have 
		a good time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Take a tip from the life of 
		the Prophet Joseph Smith:&nbsp; run and jump, dance and sing, go swimming in 
		safe places, ride horses, go hiking and climbing.&nbsp; Whatever you do, get 
		yourself trained, get the right equipment, and go with someone who is an 
		expert. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please do not be fooled by 
		all the other claims of false joy coming from the great and spacious 
		building.&nbsp; We have the real thing right here.&nbsp; All those phrases I 
		mentioned earlierthe ones with words like always, all, whole, complete, 
		filled, and perfect in themthey are the answer.&nbsp; They are the way to 
		real joy, the joy of redemption.&nbsp; Dont make the mistake of ignoring the 
		Lords invitation to experience the joy of redemption or all the 
		marvelous things He has given us to help us: &nbsp;the power of His 
		Atonement, temples, priesthood power, gifts of the Spirit, the Church.&nbsp; 
		Dont make the mistake of thinking that it is too hard or that He is 
		inviting someone else.&nbsp; He is inviting you.&nbsp; As President Hinckley said:</font></p>

		My husband, Dean, and I have been reading the Book of Mormon this 
		yearnot only because its the course of study for Sunday Schoolbut 
		because we are actively engaged now in preparing to leave in September 
		for our mission.&nbsp; As we have read the accounts of the people given by 
		the Book of Mormon prophets, we have once again been amazed at the 
		patterns of living exhibited by these individuals.&nbsp; Youve seen it too:&nbsp; 
		humility and blessings; pride and apostasy.&nbsp; Sometimes I just want to 
		say to them, Dont you get it?&nbsp; Cant you see what youre doing?&nbsp; Why 
		dont you stop!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		During one of our reading sessions, we came to the chapter in Helaman 
		where we first learn of Helamans sons, Nephi and Lehi.&nbsp; In Helaman, 
		chapter 3, we read: And it came to pass that he had two sons.&nbsp; He gave 
		unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of 
		Lehi.&nbsp; <b><i>And they began to grow up unto the Lord</i></b> (Helaman 
		3: 21).&nbsp; In later chapters, we learn, of course, why these boys were 
		given these names by their father:&nbsp; Behold, I have given unto you the 
		names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and 
		this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; 
		and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye 
		remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, 
		that they were good.&nbsp; Therefore, my sons, <b><i>I would that ye should 
		do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, 
		even as it has been said and written of them</i></b> (Helaman 5: 6-7).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		As we read further into Helaman, we learn that not only did these boys 
		grow to adulthood knowing, loving, and serving the Lord, but that they 
		stayed in the same path throughout their lives.&nbsp; It is to this ideathis 
		staying put, staying true, enduringthat I want to devote my visit with 
		you today.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">I 
		imagine that many of you here todayperhaps even most of youhave grown 
		up in homes where you have been taught the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Even 
		if you are the first generation in your family to have embraced the 
		gospel, I imagine that you grew up knowing about and/or feeling 
		spiritual yearnings.&nbsp; But now, you are on your own.&nbsp; All of us, sooner 
		or later, grow up and leave the places that have nurtured and cared for 
		us.&nbsp; I lived at home while attending college, and it was only when I 
		began teaching school and my parents moved, that I had to start being 
		grown up and live on my own.&nbsp; Candidly, it was a hard time for me.&nbsp; I 
		lived in an apartment with very few creature comforts, a roommate who 
		went home every weekend, and a car with standard shift that scared the 
		wits out of me to drive!&nbsp; I had very little money, no friends close by, 
		and had it not been that Dean and I became engaged and married during 
		that fall, I am not sure if I would have endured the situation very well 
		at all.&nbsp; My church experience occurred regularly, but it came because I 
		went back to my old home ward each weekend.&nbsp; Sundays were my lifeline to 
		friends and to the Lord.&nbsp; Maybe I wasnt as grown up as I thought I 
		was.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		This growing up timetransition time, some would call itoften is a 
		defining experience for us in our commitment to the Gospel and to 
		remembering what we know and have been taught.&nbsp; Those of you who are 
		returned missionaries, have prolonged to some degree, the time when you 
		must make the decision about your gospel commitment.&nbsp; Obviously, a 
		mission enhances your commitment, but frankly, does not always guarantee 
		that you will endure; that you will continue to grow up unto the Lord.&nbsp; 
		The world, as you know, offers both blatant and subtle enticements.&nbsp; The 
		subtle sirens are the ones I fear most. &nbsp;Television, movies and the 
		internet are where I have most observed the ability of these sirens to 
		entrap us.&nbsp; For example, television comedies frequently depict 
		individualsoften singlewho are engaging in a life of me-ness and in 
		a lifestyle that is by the standards of the Gospel and Church, immoral.&nbsp; 
		And yet, many watch them.&nbsp; And when asked why they watch them, their 
		response is, Theyre funny.&nbsp; But I must challenge that answer.&nbsp; As we 
		are trying to live close to the Church and continue our growing up to 
		the Lord, is this kind of show something the Lord would be pleased with? 
		&nbsp;I frankly, dont think He would.&nbsp; I feel the same about shows and 
		activities that enthrone violence and profane behavior as well.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		Now, perhaps you say, Sister Hughes, those shows are only make 
		believe.&nbsp; I dont do things like that, nor would I.&nbsp; Well, in todays 
		world, when many call evil good and good evil, I wonder if we can or 
		even should take those kinds of chances.&nbsp; We need always to ask what we 
		are doing to our spirit.&nbsp; Is the divine within us being nurtured and is 
		it growing or do our actions prevent the spirit from becoming the 
		predominant force in our lives?&nbsp; Living unrighteous lives doesnt take 
		much effort or time, if we observe what happened to the Book of Mormon 
		people.&nbsp; By the time we reach the first chapter of 3 Nephi in our 
		reading of the Book of Mormon, we can see what has once again happened 
		to the people.&nbsp; The Nephites are, for the most part, corrupt; the 
		Lamanites who have become the more righteous group, are falling away as 
		well.&nbsp; Nephi records this, starting in verse 29:&nbsp; There was also a 
		cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many 
		children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, <b><i>that 
		they became for themselves,</i></b> and were led away by some who were 
		Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words. . . . And thus 
		the Lamanites were afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their 
		faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising 
		generation (3 Nephi 1: 29-30). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		We must, all of us, be on guard so that we do not, become for 
		ourselves. &nbsp;Thats an interesting phrase.&nbsp; It implies to me that they 
		looked to themselves first and indulged desires that prophets had warned 
		them to avoid.&nbsp; They yielded to Satans enticements and allures: his 
		lies and flattering words.&nbsp; At some point in each of our lives, we must 
		make the choice to embrace our faith or to dwindle in unbelief or 
		willfully rebel against the Gospel of Christ (4 Nephi: 1: 38). &nbsp;I am 
		sure the stripling warriors, taught well by their mothers, had to choose 
		to live the gospel; we know that Lehis children had to chooseand we 
		know what some of them chose.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		Brothers and Sisters, I wish I could tell you that there was one magic 
		bullet or a one-time fix to make sure we do not fall prey to these 
		enticements; that our choice would be easy to make and once made, we 
		would never have to think about it again. &nbsp;&nbsp;If there were, we would be 
		set for life.&nbsp; But, there isnt.&nbsp; However, there is a pattern, which if 
		followed, can assure that once we have chosen our Fathers 
		planregardless of where we might be or what our circumstance might 
		bewe can stay safe; we can stay true.&nbsp; The pattern is not new.&nbsp; Rather 
		it is and always has been the same.&nbsp; You have heard it in every Primary, 
		Sunday School, Young Men or Young Women, Seminary and Institute class 
		youve ever attended.&nbsp; You learned the pattern in your home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 12.0pt">
<font color="#000080">In 4<sup>th</sup> Nephi, we learn about those who 
		stayed put and whose testimony grew:&nbsp; [They] <b><i>continued in 
		fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear 
		the word of the Lord</i></b> (4 Nephi 1: 12).&nbsp; So prayer and fasting is 
		the first part of this pattern.&nbsp; For me, one of the most comforting and 
		assuring parts of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the opportunity and 
		blessing it is to pray.&nbsp; Frequently, we are not in a place where we can 
		vocalize our prayers, but as Amulek teaches us in Alma 34, verse 27:&nbsp; . 
		. .let your hearts be drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your 
		welfare and also for the welfare of those who are around you.&nbsp; And 
		often, when we read about prayer, fasting is attached with the 
		conjunction and.&nbsp; These two acts are the means by which we build our 
		testimony (see Alma 5:46).&nbsp; And both of these acts require our time and 
		thought.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 12.0pt">
<font color="#000080">I confess that in my life that my prayers have not 
		always been of the kind that required much time or thought.&nbsp; For 
		example, are we sometimes so tired when we kneel at night that we either 
		go to sleep on our knees or simply utter a prayer in which we multiply 
		words and repeat the same phrases we learned in childhood?&nbsp; I have been 
		guilty of both these mistakes.&nbsp; On the other hand, our bishop told us 
		recently about his grandfather who joined the church late in his life 
		and did not, as the Bishop said, have time to learn the pat and stock 
		phrases of prayer we so often use.&nbsp; Rather, said Bishop Hight, his 
		grandfather gave thanks for simple things he loved and reveredlike the 
		organ in the chapel he met in each Sunday.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 12.0pt">
<font color="#000080">In the Priesthood and Relief Society course of 
		study for this year, there is a chapter on prayer and personal 
		revelation.&nbsp; I loved this quote from chapter 10: A Church member 
		recalled hearing [the Prophet Joseph] pray during a time of great 
		personal difficulty.&nbsp; Never until then had I heard a man address his 
		Maker as though He was present listening as a kind father would listen 
		to the sorrows of a dutiful child.There was no ostentation, no raising 
		of the voice as by enthusiasm, but a plain conversational tone, as a man 
		would address a present friend. (<i>Teachings of the Presidents of the 
		Church: Joseph Smith, </i>p 127).&nbsp; Cant we do the same? Will you also 
		remember President Eyrings counsel to us in October 2007 General 
		Conference to ask ourselves each day, Did God send a message that was 
		just for me? Did I see His hand in my life or the lives of my children?</font><span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2008-04-21T11:15" cite="mailto:%20"><font color="#000080">

<font color="#000080"><i>Dean:&nbsp; When I returned from my mission back 
			in the 1960s, I was going to Weber State, majoring in English and 
			minoring in Philosophy. Two of my favorite professors were men who 
			had grown up as Latter-day Saints but had now outgrown their 
			beliefs. They loved to poke fun at the logic or what they considered 
			the logic of the foolish local culture, as they liked to refer to 
			Latter-day Saints. I struggled with that, but they were brilliant, 
			charming men, and I thought I was strong enough to handle anything 
			they threw at me.</i></font></p>

<font color="#000080"><i>Skepticism seems to come naturally to me,

			testimony began to grow. I started to wonder whether any of my

			was absolutely real to me. I had established a relationship with God

		And what about fasting?&nbsp; Coupled with mighty prayer, fasting has the 
		power to move heaven in direct and significant ways.&nbsp; Sometimes fasting 
		can bring a renewal of health and strength to bodies weakened by 
		illness; sometimes it can open up minds and hearts to give assistance to 
		individuals who are in need of help; sometimes it can cause droughts and 
		famines to be broken; sometimes it can enlarge our understanding of our 
		lives so that we can begin to change things for the better.&nbsp; And always, 
		fasting can bring us peacethe peace to know that the Lord knows us and 
		understands our needs and hearts.&nbsp; But fasting is not to be done with 
		casualness.&nbsp; As we prepare to fast, we should clearly know why we are 
		fasting and what we desire as a blessing from the Lord.&nbsp; The more 
		specific, the better, because then our prayers can be more focused and 
		our words more clear.&nbsp; Becoming serious in our fasting also makes it 
		easier to fast.&nbsp; Our bodies become subservient to our spirits. And this 
		is what the Lord wants to have happen to us.&nbsp; Used together, prayer and 
		fasting humble us, teach us, and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father 
		and His Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They are wonderful acts of faith that will 
		keep us growing up to the Lord.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		The next part of the pattern is that they met together oft both to pray 
		and to hear the word of the Lord.&nbsp; You are so blessed as women and men 
		to be able, here at BYUIdaho, to have the opportunity to meet together 
		every day in an environment that builds faith.&nbsp; Your professors and 
		friends can speak freely about the gospel and testimony in your 
		classrooms; you have religion classes where testimony is shared; your 
		church meetings are close at hand.&nbsp; Not all people who attend a 
		university have so supportive a situation.&nbsp; And someday, you, in all 
		probability will not be in such a tightly-knit environment of people of 
		your own faith.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		In some places that I have visited, just getting to church is very 
		difficult and requires a great sacrifice of time and resources.&nbsp; A few 
		years ago I met a woman in Texas who, with her husband, were living only 
		on their Social Security check, and for her it took a lot of budgeting 
		just to have the money each month to buy gas so that they could make the 
		80-mile round trip to church each week.&nbsp; And yet, they did.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		In many areas, the situation is even more difficult because 
		transportation is limited and finances scarce.&nbsp; Sisters Parkin and 
		Pingree and I had the unique experience of being part of a Relief 
		Society teleconference with women who live in the Bush District of 
		Alaska.&nbsp; These women and families, who often live on islands in the 
		Aleutian chain or in remote areas of the state, have food and home 
		supplies flown into them a few times a year.&nbsp; There is not a Smiths 
		food market or Target in their towns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where there is more than one 
		family who is LDS, they meet together in a home; but most often, they 
		are the only family in their area, and they meet together each week to 
		partake of the sacrament and to hear the word of God.&nbsp; They must do it 
		themselves.&nbsp; The sisters visit teach and share the gospel messages with 
		women they have never met.&nbsp; The internet or a phone is their connection 
		to each other and to the fellowship or sisterhood with the Saints.&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
		yet, in spite of these difficult circumstances, they have made the 
		choice to continue to grow toward the Lord and desire that their 
		children have this same blessing and opportunity.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		Now, I want to add something else to this pattern--something that I 
		believe can do much toward keeping us within the embrace of the Gospel 
		and help us to endure and grow.&nbsp; Im speaking of the temple.&nbsp; This past 
		year I have had the blessing of being an ordinance worker in the Provo 
		Temple.&nbsp; As I have had the experience of being a part of this great 
		work, I have come to realize more fully how important it is to us to 
		participate frequently and regularly in those ordinances.&nbsp; Just as we 
		partake of the sacrament each week to renew our baptismal covenants with 
		the Lord, I believe that participating in the ordinances of the temple 
		reminds us of the importance of our covenants and strengthens us in our 
		power to overcome the evils of this world.&nbsp; Doctrine and Covenants 109 
		is the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple.&nbsp; Listen to words of 
		the Prophet Joseph as he asks the Fathers blessing on those who 
		participate in the temple endowment:&nbsp; And we ask thee, Holy Father, 
		that thy servants [thats you and me] may go forth from this house armed 
		with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be 
		round about them, and thine angels have charge over them; [a]nd from 
		this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings, in 
		truth, unto the ends of the earth, that they may know that this is thy 
		work. . .&nbsp; (DC 109: 22-23).&nbsp;&nbsp; Just think of it, brothers and sisters!&nbsp; 
		We can be armed with the Lords power, the Lords name will be upon us, 
		the Lords glory around us, and angels will have charge over usall of 
		this because we participate in the ordinances of the temple.&nbsp; Certainly, 
		with frequent temple attendance as well as continued righteous living, 
		we are assured of these blessings.&nbsp; I have also been struck this year at 
		how many of the ordinances workers are young college-aged men and 
		women.&nbsp; How wonderful to be united with them in performing this great 
		work!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I serve in the early session each Tuesday morning, and 
		sometimes these women are late for prayer meeting and look a little 
		sleepy, but they bound up the stairs, while the more mature ones of us 
		have to hang on tight to the stair railings so we dont trip over our 
		dresses!&nbsp; Their minds, unlike some of us who are more seasoned with age, 
		are more agile, but their smiles and commitment to service is no less 
		sincere and joy-filled. It is a blessing to me to hear the young women I 
		serve with telling me about their lives, their hopes and desires.&nbsp; Age 
		is not an issue among us because we are united in the same endeavor.&nbsp;

		Prayer and fasting, meeting together often to pray and hear the word of 
		God, temple attendance, (and I hope it goes without sayingstudying the 
		scriptures) these, my dear brothers and sisters, are a pattern we can 
		and should follow if we are to remain true and steadfast and grow up to 
		the Lord.&nbsp; And what are the blessings that await us for our faithfulness 
		and our continued devotion to the Lord and His kingdom?&nbsp; Lets go back 
		to the story of Nephi and Lehi, but now lets read in Helaman, chapter 
		10.&nbsp; In this chapter we see Nephi returning to his home, downcast 
		because of the wickedness of the people.&nbsp; In earlier chapters he had 
		revealed to the multitude the name of the person who had killed the high 
		priest.&nbsp; Many had come to believe on Nephis words because of this 
		knowledge; most had not and had reviled him and scoffed at his message.&nbsp; 
		Now, as he walked toward his home, pondering on what had happened, a 
		voice came to him saying: Blessed art thou Nephi, for those things 
		which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou has with <b><i>
		unwearyingness </i></b>declared the word, which I have given unto thee, 
		unto this people.&nbsp; And thou has not feared them, and hast <b><i>not 
		sought thine own life, but has sought my will, and to keep my 
		commandments.&nbsp; And now, because thou has done this with such 
		unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever;</i></b> and I will 
		make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even 
		that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou 
		shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will (Helaman 10: 4-5).&nbsp; If 
		you follow the footnote citations for these verses, you discover that 
		unwearyingness means devotion.&nbsp; And devotion means that we stay put; 
		that we endure in faith to the end.&nbsp; But Nephis blessing is also our 
		blessing as well.&nbsp; We can and will have, just as Nephi, all that the 
		Father has.&nbsp; He is a generous and gracious Father to all who love and 
		keep His commandments.&nbsp; Nephi and Lehi did, and so we can and must.&nbsp; And 
		then the Savior will say of us, as He did to the Nephites during His 
		sojourn among them, [M]y joy is great, even unto fulness, because of 
		you, and also this generation; yea and even the Father rejoiceth, and 
		also all the holy angels, because of you and this generation; for none 
		of them are lost (3 Nephi: 27: 30).</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
		Nephi did not grow weary and he didnt, as the Lord said, seek his own 
		life. &nbsp;He didnt become for himself. &nbsp;You will leave college, and you 
		will set out in careers and in building your own families.&nbsp; Youll seek 
		the dreams the world holds out for you, and thats as it should be.&nbsp; But 
		if you seek what the world offers and dismiss what the Lord has in store 
		for you, youll miss the greatest joys of this life and the life to 
		come.&nbsp; So seek the Lords will for you, not only your own, and find it 
		in prayer and fasting, find it in temple service, and as the Lords will 
		is made known to you, stay fast, endure.&nbsp; Grow up unto the Lord.</font></p>

		the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; I know you come to devotional prepared to be taught and 
		I hope that true learning and teaching will be accomplished today and I

		time here and I look forward to the future with great promise and you 
		should too.&nbsp; Ive learned that things can change quickly in this 
		environment and you will be and have been the benefactors of these 
		changes.&nbsp; In the presiding councils of BYUIdaho, we dont ever consider 
		changes without asking the important question, How will this affect the 
		students?&nbsp; Knowing this you can be assured that the things you take

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I want to speak to you this 
		afternoon about <b>Becoming a Disciple</b> and what that should mean for 
		you and me.&nbsp; Much of my understanding about this process of becoming a 
		disciple comes from one of the foundational addresses give from this 
		very pulpit by Elder David A. Bednar.&nbsp; I know most of you are familiar 
		with his talk given on August 31, 2004 in which he referred to BYUIdaho 
		as a Disciple Preparation Center a DPC.&nbsp; Ive pondered the idea of BYUIdaho 
		being a Disciple Preparation Center and hope to share some of those 
		insights with you today.&nbsp; The question in your minds might be--what is 
		involved in becoming a disciple?&nbsp; Becoming a disciple involves much more 
		than simply attending classes and receiving a degree.&nbsp; I want to speak 
		plainly and sincerely today.&nbsp; If you attend classes and achieve a degree 
		and thats all you leave with, you have wasted the sacred tithes of the 
		church.&nbsp; There are many places you can gain secular learning, but here, 
		there is a clear expectation that you will leave with a deeper testimony 
		of the Gospel and become a disciple of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The entire Church 
		membership should expect and receive many blessings as a result of your 
		attendance and participation in the sacred learning processes and 
		training that are available here.&nbsp; You will owe a debt to the members of 
		the church as a result of this privilege.&nbsp; It will not be a debt that 
		you will be able to pay with money, but you will be placed in a position 
		to manage your debt to the Church. &nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a Disciple will surely be 
		the way to manage that debt.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In Elder Bednars address, he 
		describes some important characteristics of this DPC.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; It is rather
			</font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">isolated 
			geographically.&nbsp; Im sure many of you have considered Rexburg, Idaho 
			quite isolated. &nbsp;&nbsp;This fact will allow you to study without many of 
			the distraction in the world today. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp; You </font>
<font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">will reside and study 
			here for a relatively short period of time.&nbsp; If you are just 
			starting your education, four years may seem like a very long time.&nbsp; 
			I can promise, it will be over faster than you might expect.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp; The nature
			</font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">of the 
			instruction is focused and intense.&nbsp; The new academic calendar 
			certainly requires all to raise their personal bar of study and 
			focus.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp; The </font>
<font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">distinctive 
			requirements for demeanor and dress are hallmarks of this 
			institution and bless the lives of all who attend.&nbsp; For some it may 
			have taken some adjustment considering the atmosphere that abounds 
			in the world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; One of the
			</font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;most 
			important characteristics of a DPC is the location near a temple and 
			with the recent dedication of the Rexburg temple; we have the rich 
			blessing of receiving specific knowledge of our Heavenly Father and 
			his plan for each of us.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Bednar goes on to say, 
		In this special and sacred and set apart place, you and I have access 
		to unparalleled spiritual resources that can assist us in developing and 
		deepening our devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That is 
		the primary and most important reason for the existence of Brigham Young 
		University-Idaho and for its sponsorship by and affiliation with The 
		Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; Thus a disciple of Christ 
		is a follower of Jesus who learns of and from Him and lives according to 
		His teachings.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">1</font></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So what can we do to <b>
		become disciples</b> of the Lord Jesus Christ and develop and deepen our 
		devotion?&nbsp; I would recommend six guidelines in becoming a disciple.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline One.</b>&nbsp; We 
		learn of Him by studying his words.&nbsp; This comes through our study and by 
		truths taught by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; In this set apart place 
		you have the opportunity to have religious instruction in all aspect of 
		your BYUIdaho education.&nbsp; In our family we have tried to follow the 
		counsel of prophets and apostles to study from the Book of Mormon each 
		day.&nbsp; Our only daughter Kalli, who is six years old and sitting by her 
		mom today, is in kindergarten learning to read.&nbsp; When we read together 
		as a family and we get to the phase And it came to pass, we simply say 
		Kalli and she says the words And it came to pass.&nbsp; That phrase is 
		repeated often in the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; This allows Kalli the opportunity 
		to participate in our family scripture study.&nbsp; What a blessing it has 
		been for our family to read together from the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; This 
		devotional is something unique in the world in which we live.&nbsp; And I 
		testify that by faithful attendance at devotional you and I have the 
		opportunity to receive personal instruction through the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; You 
		will always be taught from the scriptures in this devotional setting.&nbsp; 
		Your campus wards and stakes provide inspired learning and teaching.&nbsp; 
		Your church leaders are called by inspiration and priesthood keys are 
		given to these dedicated servants for your benefit and blessing.&nbsp; Please 
		take full advantage of your campus ward and serve faithfully in what 
		ever assignment your bishop may give you.&nbsp; I would like to share a 
		personal story regarding the efforts of your campus bishops.&nbsp; I had the 
		opportunity a few years ago to serve as a campus bishop.&nbsp; Prior to any 
		of our regular bishopric meetings we would come together for early 
		morning study.&nbsp; Each member of the bishopric, which included students, 
		would take a turn teaching the gospel doctrine lesson for that week.&nbsp; 
		This would often require our entire bishopric to be at the Kirkham 
		Auditorium at 6:00am and dedicate the first thirty minutes of our busy 
		Sabbath day to gospel instruction.&nbsp; I was taught the power of this 
		instruction while serving as a stake clerk in the BYUIdaho 5<sup>th</sup> 
		stake.&nbsp; The entire stake presidency would take turns teaching and this 
		was a bit intimidating for me as a new clerk because our stake president 
		and one of his counselors were former mission presidents.&nbsp; Wow do I 
		remember the pressure the first time I gave the lesson on that early 
		morning hour in the Snow building.&nbsp; I testify that this kind of gospel 
		instruction is available to all of us, but to receive the benefits of 
		these lessons requires each of us to come prepared.&nbsp; I would suggest 
		that we make a greater effort to come to our meetings prepared for that 
		weeks lessons, both in gospel doctrine and in our priesthood and relief 
		society classes.&nbsp; Ive watched as new students called as teacher were 
		inspired and inspiring to those who attended their classes.&nbsp; Some of 
		these teachers may have been in Priest or Laurel classes only a few 
		weeks earlier.&nbsp; And yet when hands were laid upon their heads and they 
		were set apart, they could give powerful lessons through the Holy 
		Ghost.&nbsp; <b>Doctrine and Covenants 42:61 <i>If thou shalt ask, thou shalt 
		receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou 
		mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things-that which bringeth joy, 
		that which bringeth life eternal.</i></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">
<b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline Two.&nbsp; </b>We 
		develop our discipleship by learning the principle of <b>Remembering</b>.&nbsp; 
		The principle of remembering is used often in the scriptures and in our 
		modern day revelations.&nbsp; The Book of Mormon has numerous examples of 
		what happened when the Nephites <b>remembered</b> the Lord and when they 
		failed to remember.&nbsp; Much of our discipleship will be dependent on our 
		ability to remember the blessings we receive daily from the hand of the 
		Lord.&nbsp; As we learn to recognize and remember these blessings, we will 
		avoid the pride of the world.&nbsp; In <b>Helaman 12:2</b> <b><i>Yea, and we 
		may see at the very time when he doth prosper this people, yea, in the 
		increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and 
		in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; 
		sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their 
		enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not 
		declare wars against them; ye, and in fine, doing all things for the 
		welfare and happiness of his people; yea, this is the time that they do 
		harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample 
		under their feet the Holy Oneyea and this because of their ease, and 
		their exceedingly great prosperity.</i></b>&nbsp; Elder Henry B. Eyring gave 
		an inspiring address in October 2007 General Conference regarding the 
		need to remember the blessing we receive from the Lord.&nbsp; He said, My 
		point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember Gods 
		kindness.&nbsp; It will build our testimonies; you may not keep a journal.&nbsp; 
		You may not share whatever record you keep with those you love and 
		serve.&nbsp; But you and they will be blessed as you remember what the Lord 
		has done.&nbsp; It will not be easy to remember.&nbsp; Living as we do with the 
		veil over our eyes, we cannot remember what it was like to live with our 
		Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in the premotal 
		world; nor can we see with our physical eyes or with reason alone the 
		hand of God in our lives.&nbsp; Seeing such things takes the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; And 
		it is not easy to be worthy of the Holy Ghosts companionship in a 
		wicked world.&nbsp; And the challenge to remember has always been the hardest 
		for those who are blessed abundantly.&nbsp; He concludes by saying, Tonight 
		and tomorrow night, you might pray and ponder, asking the questions: Did 
		God send a message that was just for me?&nbsp; Did I see His hand in my life 
		or the lives of my children?&nbsp; I will do that.&nbsp; And then I will find a 
		way to preserve that memory for the day that I, and those that I love, 
		will need to remember how much God loves us and how much we need Him.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We will become disciples as 
		we learn to focus on and remember the covenants we make at baptism and 
		in the temple.&nbsp; We can achieve this as we renew and remember those 
		promises each week as we partake of the sacrament and by regular temple 
		attendance.&nbsp; Our success in this life will be contingent on our ability 
		to remember sacred things.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline Three.</b>&nbsp; 
		Becoming a disciple requires our understanding of the principle of one 
		by one.&nbsp; I learned this principle of one by one from Elder Bednar 
		shortly after I was called to be a campus bishop.&nbsp; Elder Bednar, then 
		President Bednar called me to his office after I was called as a campus 
		bishop and I have <b>remembered </b>that lesson to this day.&nbsp; Elder 
		Bednar taught me this principle of one by one using the story of the 
		brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; The brother of Jared had molten 
		16 stones to light their barges as they crossed the ocean to the 
		Promised Land.&nbsp; In <b>Ether 3:4-6</b> <b><i>And I know, O Lord, that 
		thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of 
		man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare 
		them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine unto us 
		in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we 
		shall cross the sea.&nbsp; Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this.&nbsp; We know that 
		thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the 
		understanding of men.&nbsp; And it came to pass that when the brother of 
		Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand 
		and touched the stones one by one with his finger.&nbsp; And the veil was 
		taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger 
		of the Lord; and it was the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; 
		and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck 
		with fear.</i></b>&nbsp; In this example the Lord touched the stones one by 
		one.&nbsp; Im sure the Lord could have simply passed his hand over the 
		stones and made them all glow at once.&nbsp; But imagine the powerful witness 
		it was for the brother of Jared to see the finger of the Lord each time 
		he touched the stones.&nbsp; Another example of the principle of one was 
		taught by the Savior.&nbsp; In <b>3 Nephi 17:21</b> <b><i>And when he had 
		said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it and he 
		took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed 
		unto the Father for them.</i></b>&nbsp; Ive come to realize that as a 
		disciple we can change others one by one and have lasting influence.&nbsp; I 
		have tried to apply that learning in all my service to others.&nbsp; I have 
		two pieces of art work hanging in my office.&nbsp; They are from the Book of 
		Mormon.&nbsp; One is the picture depicting Abinidi preaching to wicked King 
		Noah and the wicked priests.&nbsp; Abinidis preaching comprises only six 
		chapters in the Book of Mormon, yet the influence of this one man was 
		felt throughout the record.&nbsp; Because of Abinidi, Alma was converted and 
		then converted his son and the sons of Mosiah, who converted the 
		Anti-Nephi-Lehis, who were the parents of the 2,000 stripling warriors.&nbsp; 
		Im sure many of you have had the opportunity to influence others for 
		good.&nbsp; In every calling we have in the church we can be an influence for 
		change one by one.&nbsp; I would like to share an insight from a young man 
		that was in my campus ward.&nbsp; His name is Jon and I share this with his 
		permission.&nbsp; He said <b><i>Ive loved being involved with Wards and 
		Stakes, with leaders who love and care about me and those that I have

		have been assigned there. I have witnessed blessings in my life and the

		&nbsp;&nbsp;To be completely honest, Jon did meet his future wife, Ruth in our 
		ward and Im sure he would agree that was a direct result of his 
		dedicated service to others.&nbsp; His wife, Ruth adds <b><i>I appreciated 
		the information I learned about being a faithful visiting teacher.&nbsp; As I 
		now attend different wards outside of the BYUIdaho campus I realized 
		that the simple characteristics of praying for the sisters, preparing

		Im grateful that these principles were testified to me and applied in 
		my life.</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I also recognize that many of you have been

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline Four.</b>&nbsp; As a 
		disciple you must be able to lead and teach others in a way that doesnt 
		set you above them, but allows you to influence them for good.&nbsp; This is 
		not only expected of BYUIdaho graduates, it has been prophesied that 
		you will do this.&nbsp; That prophesy was given in another foundational 
		address A Steady, Upward Course given by Elder Henry B. Eyring on 
		September 18, 2001.&nbsp; Elder Eyring prophesied that you would become the 
		type of individuals that lead and teach.&nbsp; He said, You can imagine the 
		joy of an employer or a Church leader when such a graduate arrives.&nbsp; The 
		graduates will be at personal peace by having kept the commandments.&nbsp; 
		They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn.&nbsp; 
		They will have power to 8nnovate and improve without requiring more of 
		what money can buy.&nbsp; Those graduates of BYUIdaho will become-and this 
		is a prophesy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly--those 
		graduates of BYUIdaho will become legendary for their capacity to build 
		the people around them and to add value wherever they serve.&nbsp; I hope I 
		live long enough to someday meet some employer who employed one of you 
		and says, where did that come from?&nbsp; Ive never had such a person.&nbsp; Why 
		people just flock around that person.&nbsp; And they want to follow.&nbsp; They 
		dont have to be led; theyre seeking to go where that person wants to 
		go.&nbsp; And they come up with new ideas.&nbsp; I dont know where that comes 
		from.&nbsp; They seem to find a better way, and the budget doesnt go up.&nbsp; I 
		cant understand it.&nbsp; And Ill smile and say, well come with me to 
		Rexburg and I may not be able to show it to you, and I may not be able 
		to prove it to you, but youll feel it. </font>
<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		I know that many of you have had those types of teaching and leading 
		moment when you have been an influence for good in the lives of those 
		youve come in contact with.&nbsp; Remember those moments and work toward 
		achieving them often throughout your lives.&nbsp; This will happen in your 
		work, the church, and most importantly, your families.&nbsp; To illustrate 
		this principle of leadership and teaching I would like to share an email 
		from a student who served on my Student Support Council.&nbsp; Her name is 
		Kiersten and I received her permission to share her insight today.&nbsp; She 
		said, <b><i>When I went to that first meeting, I was overwhelmed. I saw 
		all of these men, in their black suits with briefcases. When I sat down, 
		I felt like I was amongst giants. As we had the first of many prayers, I 
		was struck by the fact that these men would bow their heads, and ask 
		Heavenly Father for inspiration on how to guide the students at BYUIdaho. 
		I had always seen the administration building as a place away from the 
		school, I had no idea that they cared about students to the extent they 
		did. I was very pleasantly surprised and humbled.&nbsp; I havent seen you in 
		a while and there is something really interesting Id like to tell you 
		about.&nbsp; Do you remember a couple of months ago when we used to have one 
		on one meetings in your office?&nbsp; In one of those meetings, you told me 
		that the experiences that I would gain by sitting in those council 
		meetings would prepare me for being a Relief Society President someday.&nbsp; 
		I thought to myself Yeah, this will prepare me, but not for something 
		like that.&nbsp; Well Brother Harris, as ironic as it is, I was called to be 
		a Relief Society President and I was sustained this past Sunday.&nbsp; I was 
		just thinking about how huge of a responsibility this is going to be for 
		me, and I was thinking that I dont know where to startbut then I 
		started thinking of the meetings that I was in, and how everything was 
		brought up in that council.&nbsp; I guess that the Lord has ways of preparing 
		people in ways that we will always be thankful for. </i></b>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now I know that Kiersten 
		needed to learn many things in order to serve, but she put forth the 
		effort to make her experience all that it could be.&nbsp; I testify that this 
		experience happens many times each semester and you have the unique 
		opportunity to learn these of leadership and teaching skills.&nbsp; The 
		graduates of BYUIdaho will be the answer to a bishops prayer for a 
		great youth leader to be a positive influence in the lives of the youth 
		in his ward.&nbsp; Please take full advantage of that opportunity.&nbsp; </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline Five.</b>&nbsp; 
		Becoming a disciple requires a mighty change take place in our hearts.&nbsp; 
		This is a personal judgment that each of us must make as we evaluate 
		where we are in relationship to our Fathers plan and our progress 
		towards that might change.&nbsp; The scriptures have many instances where 
		this might change is described.&nbsp; Two I would like to share today come 
		for the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; Please turn to <b>Mosiah 3:19</b> <b><i>For the 
		natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and 
		will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy 
		Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the 
		atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a little child, 
		submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to 
		all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child 
		doth submit to this father.</i></b>&nbsp; Elder Maxwell has called this verse 
		One of the greatest gems in scriptures. I find it interesting that 
		this verse has 11 footnotes, which would suggest the need to spend time 
		in study and seeking understanding.&nbsp; I will not attempt to break down 
		all the principles taught in this scripture, but would suggest that you 
		take a moment during this week to study and contemplate the importance 
		of this verse.&nbsp; Putting off the natural man and yielding to the 
		enticings of the spirit is important in the process by which we 
		experience the mighty change of heart.&nbsp; Again in Mosiah we read, M<b>osiah 
		5:2 <i>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all 
		the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their 
		surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which 
		has wrought mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more 
		disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i></b><i> </i>&nbsp;Can 
		you imagine what kind of world we would have if we all had a mighty 
		change take place that we all wanted to do good continually.&nbsp; As 
		disciples you must achieve this mighty change so you can have that same 
		influence on others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Guideline Six.&nbsp; </b>
		Disciples understand the importance of making and keeping sacred 
		covenants.&nbsp; This university is a set apart place that many have referred 
		to as a temple of learning.&nbsp; This comes about as a result of the 
		presence of the Holy Ghost and the true principles that are taught 
		here.&nbsp; There are certain requirements to attend the temple and there are 
		certain requirements to attend BYUIdaho.&nbsp; Some may look at these 
		requirements as too restrictive, but in reality these requirements help 
		us prepare to enter into those saving ordinances of the gospel that can 
		only be accomplished in the House of the Lord.&nbsp; If you have looked at 
		the dress and grooming requirement and were bothered about living by 
		these standards, I would suggest you take a hard look into your soul and 
		make a mighty change in your life.&nbsp; All of this is designed to help us 
		make and keep sacred covenants.&nbsp; In the temple we make covenants and 
		witness to the Lord that we can be trusted with sacred things.&nbsp; Once we 
		learn the importance of our covenants we will be well on our way to 
		becoming disciples.&nbsp; I testify that through regular temple attendance 
		you will begin to see the Lords plan more clearly and you will 
		understand your responsibility in that plan.&nbsp; As children come into your 
		life, and I know for many of you, that experience of parenting is 
		already underway, you will come to see the great plan of salvation and 
		your roles as righteous parents in Zion.&nbsp; The strength and future of the 
		church lies in the teaching and training of your children because you 
		understand and keep sacred covenants.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In conclusion, the principle 
		of <b>becoming a disciple</b> is not just the completion of six 
		guidelines Ive proposed today, nor is it simply completing certain 
		tasks or assignment you might receive during your lifetime.&nbsp; It is 
		rather the application of knowledge that leads us to be truly converted 
		to the Gospel of Christ and to act for ourselves and not be acted upon.&nbsp; 
		Perhaps the apostle Paul said it best in <b>Ephesians 4:13-14</b> <b><i>
		Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the 
		Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the 
		fulness of Christ:&nbsp; That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to 
		and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of 
		men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</i></b>&nbsp; 
		We have the sole responsibility to become disciples.&nbsp; Many will attend 
		this great institution and become a force for good around the world.&nbsp; 
		The sacred tithing funds that support our efforts here should be treated 
		with great reverence by all who attend and work here.&nbsp; There are many in 
		the church that do not get the opportunity to attend and your chance to 
		be here can have great benefits in your life and the lives of others 
		that you serve.&nbsp; Become a disciple and live up to your true potential.&nbsp; 
		President Hinckley said the following in a regional conference in Oahu, 
		Hawaii on January 22, 2000 </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 27.0pt"><i>
<font color="#000080">Believe in yourselves, Believe in your capacity

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I think the summary statement

		our scriptures is quite fitting for all who attend here and who will go

		difference.&nbsp; He said, <b><i>These are days never to be forgottento sit 
		under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven

		will look back on this time in the history of the Church and know that 
		we were all a part of something very special.&nbsp; Im truly grateful for my 
		blessing of being here at BYUIdaho at this historic time and my heart 
		is full of gratitude to God for that blessing.&nbsp; As the Kingdom of God 
		rolls forth and the Church is recognized in more parts of the world, you 
		will stand as beacons of light in a world that is desperate to find such 
		a light in their lives.&nbsp; And many will look to your example and will 
		want to follow.&nbsp; May we each have a renewed sense of gratitude and do 
		all within our power to become a disciple of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify that there is great

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I just spent winter semester 
		at home with our baby. It was the 
		most fulfilling period of my life. I wanted to bottle up and save every 
		day I got to spend with this precious baby. There was a time (or rather, 
		times) in my life when I wondered if I would ever be a mother. First, 
		when I was an Old Maid by Mormon standards (28), with no real prospects. 
		If I couldnt even get a date, how could I ever get married, I wondered. 
		Then again, after five years of marriage, my husband and I wondered whether we 
		would ever have children. I dont know why I had to wait so long or why 
		the Lords plan for me didnt include a household full of children by 
		this time in my life as my own plan did. Maybe He wanted to make sure I 
		would cherish every minute with my son, as I have, and offer up my 
		gratitude for the blessing he is in our lives every day. What I do know 
		is that the Lord has directed my path at each step of the way. I know He 
		has a special purpose for me and my life just as he does for you and 
		yours.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Unfortunately, many of Gods 
		children have no idea of His plan for their lives. A leading scholar on 
		adolescence and human development recently reported the results of a 
		study indicating that, in general, youth in America lack purpose. 
		William Damon, Stanford Professor of Education, writes: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">In 
		our interviews and surveys, only about one in five young people in the 
		12-22-year age range express a clear vision of where they want to go, 
		what they want to accomplish in life, and why. The largest portion of 
		those we interviewed -- almost 60 percent -- may have engaged in some 
		potentially purposeful activities, or they may have developed some vague 
		aspirations; but they do not have any real commitment to such activities 
		or any realistic plans for pursuing their aspirations. The remaining 
		portion of today's youth population -- almost a quarter of those we 
		interviewed in the first of our studies -- express no aspirations <i>at 
		all</i>. In some cases, they claim that they see no point in acquiring 
		any.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">1</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Its easy to see how many of 
		the common complaints about your generation could be blamed on this lack 
		of purposefulness and direction. Fortunately, you dont have to wonder 
		hopelessly about the purpose of your life. The restored Gospel teaches 
		us that life has a purpose, that God has a plan--even a plan for 
		happiness--for all of His children. Furthermore, we know that God has a 
		special individual purpose for each one of us. Former Presiding Bishop 
		H. Burke Peterson said: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">You 
		were preserved to come to the earth in this time for a special purpose. 
		Not just a few of you, but all of you. There are things for each of you 
		to do that no one else can do as well as you.If you will let Him, I 
		testify that our Father in Heaven will walk with you through the journey 
		of life and inspire you to know your special purpose here.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">2</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Id like to talk with you 
		today about finding and fulfilling the Lords special purpose for our 
		lives. Let me begin with an example of a young adult who was inspired to 
		know of his special purpose. Joseph got a preview of his purpose at a 
		young age from two dreams showing that someday his family of mostly 
		older brothers would one day bow at his feet. Joseph might have imagined 
		a life spent raising livestock in Canaan near his family would lead him 
		to great wealth that would cause his brothers to plead for his help, or 
		perhaps he imagined gaining great knowledge and understanding that would 
		cause his older brothers to seek his counsel. The Genesis account 
		doesnt get specific, but it seems unlikely that Joseph could have ever 
		imagined the course that would lead to fulfilling his lifes purpose.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We know Joseph was a man of 
		great faith who trusted in the Lords plan for him. When his own 
		brothers sold him into slavery, he might have wondered how becoming a 
		slave could fulfill the Lords purposes. But he remained faithful, 
		working hard as Potiphars servant and continuing to gain the Lords 
		favor. Then when he demonstrated great righteousness in the face of 
		temptation, Joseph landed in prison. The scriptures tell us, But the 
		Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favor in the 
		sight of the keeper of the prison.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">3</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At this point, I probably 
		would have been thinking something like <i>my own brothers sold me into 
		slavery, but I tried to stay positive. I did what the Lord asked, I 
		worked hard, I avoided temptation, and then I got thrown in jail. Im 
		supposed to become the leader of my family, and here I am sitting in 
		prison, and Im supposed to be <b>thankful </b>that the prison guard is
		<b>nice </b>to me? How can this possibly be part of the Lords great 
		plan for my life? Has he forgotten me? Does my life really have a 
		purpose? Maybe He did have a plan for me, but I have done something to 
		be unworthy of the plan, and now I will never obtain it.</i> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Certainly these are the kinds 
		of thoughts the adversary would have encouraged. And think how the 
		temptation to give in to such thoughts would have increased as Josephs 
		time in prison stretched to two years. These were probably <b>not</b> 
		the best two years of Josephs life. Given Josephs situation it would 
		have been difficult, at best, to see how things could ever work out.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Despite these hardships, a 
		great man like Joseph probably said daily prayers of gratitude for the 
		prison guards favor as he kept faith that somehow sitting in jail was 
		part of fulfilling the Lords plan for him. Eventually an unlikely 
		opportunity presented itself to use his spiritual gifts to assist the 
		Pharoah, and Joseph suddenly found himself governor of Egypt. At this 
		point, maybe some of the events of his life were starting to make more 
		sense. If he had entertained despairing thoughts during his prison 
		sentence, Joseph probably looked back now with a wish that he hadnt 
		wasted time worrying about his future. He should have known and trusted 
		that the Lord would ultimately deliver him. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Finally, Josephs brothers 
		arrive seeking his help, bowing down at his feet as the dreams foretold. 
		Now the reasons for Josephs slavery and prison time become perfectly 
		clear. When Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, he tells them, be 
		not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God 
		did send me before you to preserve lifeAnd God sent me before you to 
		preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great 
		deliverance. So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God. (Gen. 
		45:5,7-8) Not only did God have a plan for Joseph, but God had a plan 
		for the entire House of Israel in which Joseph was to play an 
		indispensible role.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What strikes me most about 
		this story is that the trials Joseph faced were not just the result of 
		men being allowed to exercise their agency, not just tests of Josephs 
		faith and obedience, and not just learning opportunities for Joseph. 
		What looked at the time like obstacles in Josephs life turned out to be 
		key events leading to fulfillment of Josephs special calling. &nbsp;Like 
		Joseph, I have often looked back on events in my life that didnt make 
		much sense at the time to discover that they were key events in the 
		Lords plan for my life. If only I had been more faithful at the time, I 
		would have avoided so much worry and stress.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Id like to share four 
		principles suggested by Josephs story that might help you avoid some 
		unnecessary worry as you seek to fulfill the Lords special purpose for 
		your life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Principle #1: Draw upon 
		all of your spiritual resources</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Weve been given abundant 
		spiritual resources to help us find and fulfill our lifes purpose. They 
		include, among others, the Gift of the Holy Ghost, scriptures, temple 
		worship, meaningful prayer, and inspired leaders and friends. One way 
		the Lord gives us some very clear direction is through our patriarchal 
		blessings. When I received mine as a teenager, I remember getting the 
		distinct impression as it was given that I would not serve a full-time 
		mission as a young woman. Nothing in the blessing specifically said 
		that, but the impression was clear. I was a little disappointed, but 
		happily thought it must mean I would be married by the time I reached 
		mission age, ready to start the large family Id dreamed of. A few years 
		later when I turned 21 and was not married, I decided it was time to 
		find out if I should submit mission papers. I had one semester of school 
		and an internship yet to go. As I prayed about my decision, I was 
		reminded that I had been given an answer six years ago when I received 
		my patriarchal blessing. I felt slightly chastened for asking the Lord 
		for an answer Id already received. Turn with me to D&amp;C 3:4. We read, 
		For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many 
		mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught 
		the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and 
		carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon 
		him. If we want God to guide our path, we have to recognize and act on 
		the direction He gives, even if its not to our liking.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Once I accepted the answer I 
		had received, I was quickly rewarded with an internship opportunity in 
		Alabama where I could live with my grandparents. I spent a semester 
		getting to know grandparents who I had only seen about once a year while 
		growing up. The week before I left, I helped Grandma take Grandpa to the 
		doctor to check out some pains he was experiencing. About two months 
		later, Grandpa passed away from liver failure. I had not been given the 
		opportunity to wear a missionary badge, but I spent three valuable 
		months with my non-member grandfather that no full-time missionary could 
		have had. The Lord knew when I was 15 what my mission call would be.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sister Bonnie Parkin teaches 
		that the Lords plan for each of us includes a personal mission to 
		minister to Gods children. She quotes President Kimball who states:
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given 
		certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain 
		priesthood tasks. While we do not now remember the particulars, this 
		does not alter the glorious reality of what we once agreed to. You are 
		accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as 
		are those we sustain as prophets and apostles!</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">4</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sister Parkin explains:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">How 
		can we know what was entrusted to us at that time? As we accept callings 
		and love and obey the Lord, our personal ministry unfolds. It is a 
		sacred and precious thing. It embraces the people who come and go across 
		the path of our life. It extends beyond our temporary callings as 
		presidents, counselors, secretaries, teachers, and so on. It is 
		illuminated by our patriarchal blessings. And while each of our 
		ministries is unique, they allow us to become extensions of the Lords 
		love.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">5</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joseph had a personal 
		ministry that included saving Egypt and his own family from famine. 
		Through Joseph, the Lord extended His love to the House of Israel. We 
		may not have the chance to save an entire people from famine, but we 
		will have opportunities to save souls and to lift up the hands that 
		hang down. (Heb. 12:12)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Principle #2: Endure 
		faithfully knowing that God will deliver you</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My Book of Mormon teacher at 
		BYU suggested that the thesis statement of the Book of Mormon is set 
		forth in 1Ne 1:20: But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the 
		tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, 
		because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of 
		deliverance. Beginning with Lehis family, The Book of Mormon provides 
		one example after another of the Lord making his children mighty unto 
		deliverance. Our own lives offer further proof. When we come to the end 
		of the Book of Mormon and remember, as Moroni admonishes, how merciful 
		the Lord hath been unto the children of men (Mor 10:3), our testimony 
		that the Lord has always delivered his people from the creation of Adam 
		even down until the time that ye shall receive these things confirms 
		that the Lord will also deliver us if we but have faith in Him. This 
		does not mean, of course, that there will always appear to be a happy 
		ending in this lifetime.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We have heard repeatedly on 
		this campus the doctrine taught by Joseph Smith that faith is the 
		principle of action in intelligent beings</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">6</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		and that we are agents who must act rather than be acted upon.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">7</font></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Deliverance does not simply occur while we sit around waiting for things 
		to happen. Turn with me to D&amp;C 58:27:<b> </b>Verily I say, men should 
		be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own 
		free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When my friend Leslie 
		graduated single from BYU, she started working on a PhD at Wake Forest 
		University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. There was no young single 
		adult ward in Winston-Salem. Instead, there were two wards, each with a 
		small group of five to ten young singles. And, of course, most were 
		female. The possibility of finding a husband under such circumstances 
		didnt seem especially promising. To make matters worse, Leslies field 
		of study required her to spend four to seven months out of the year on a 
		(literally) desert and deserted island doing research with about three 
		other scientists. During one of her research trips, a tour boat wrecked 
		near the island. The tourists were evacuated, but a couple of young men 
		were sent to watch the boat. Andyou guessed itone of them got to be 
		friends with Leslie, accepted a Book of Mormon, went home, took the 
		discussions, was baptized, and to make a long story short, was sealed to 
		Leslie about a year later. They now have a two-year-old and are 
		expecting another baby shortly. I dont think anyone expects to meet 
		their spouse on a desert island--neither did Leslie. Shes glad she 
		didnt wait around after her college graduation, hoping for her dream 
		man to show up. She moved forward doing productive things with her life 
		that eventually led her to fulfill parts of the Lords plan for her. 
		Being anxiously engaged eventually led her to being happily engaged.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, lawyers like 
		disclaimers, so allow me to include one here: The important thing about 
		Leslies story is not that she found a husband. Gods plan for Leslie 
		could have just as easily included life as a righteous single woman. The 
		important thing about Leslies story is that she sought for and 
		discovered Gods will for her by working hard and seeking His guidance.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Principle #3 Seek to find 
		Gods will by understanding the pattern for personal revelation</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">God will deliver us as he did 
		Joseph of Egypt. But, like Joseph, we will not know the full plan from 
		the beginning. During college, I recall a friend who faced a difficult 
		decision asking, why cant we just get an email from heaven telling us 
		what to do? It might go something like this: <i>Dear Ann, Dont worry 
		about dating Bob, Fred, or Stan; focus on studying biology for now; 
		watch for Ted in dental school at State College University. Marry him 
		and make plans for 3 boys and 2 girls.</i> Wouldnt that be nice! We may 
		laugh, but I think sometimes we expect revelation to be nearly this 
		direct. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A few years ago Elder Bednar 
		taught BYUIdaho students:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">Let 
		me suggest that many of us typically assume we will receive <b><u>an</u></b> 
		answer or <b><u>a</u></b> prompting to our earnest prayers and 
		pleadings. And we also frequently expect that such <b><u>an</u></b> 
		answer or <b><u>a</u></b> prompting will come immediately and all at 
		once. Thus, we tend to believe the Lord will give us <b>A BIG ANSWER 
		QUICKLY AND ALL AT ONE TIME</b>. However, the pattern repeatedly 
		described in the scriptures suggests we receive &quot;. . . line upon line, 
		precept upon precept . . .,&quot; or in other words, <b>MANY SMALL ANSWERS 
		OVER A PERIOD OF TIME</b>. Recognizing and understanding this pattern is 
		an important key to obtaining inspiration and help from the Holy Ghost.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">8</font></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have heard attributed to 
		Elder Packer the teaching that revelation typically comes as a 
		conclusion, not as an explanation. Thus, you may feel directed away from 
		a particular major without any idea why. In fact, you may feel prompted 
		to avoid that major without any idea at the time which major you <b>
		should</b> choose. Furthermore, these conclusions we receive come 
		incrementally, as Elder Bednar taught. You will need additional small 
		answers over a period of time to discover the field of study that will 
		set you in the Lords direction for you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Josephs experience follows 
		this pattern. Elder Perry has noted that even the idolatrous Pharoah 
		recognized Josephs spiritual gifts because It was easy to recognize 
		the special spirit in him because of the way he lived and heeded the 
		voice of the Lord to direct him.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="1">9</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you ever worked on a big 
		jigsaw puzzle? You have what seems like an endless supply of these 
		little pieces that all look about the same. First you turn over all the 
		pieces and look for the edge pieces and corners. Once you find the 
		corners, you can start putting the edges together to create a framework, 
		then you go about the tedious process of searching for the middle pieces 
		that fit together. It is much easier to figure out how to put them 
		together when you look at the finished picture on the box. Our lives are 
		a little like a jigsaw puzzle. The Lord has the finished picture on the 
		box, but we dont. We can begin turning pieces over and putting in place 
		the corners and edges that make up the framework already revealed to us 
		through the words of prophets, ancient and modern. Then we might start 
		to guess at how the middle pieces should go together. If we get our mind 
		set on the picture we envision, we may completely miss the picture the 
		Lord intends. Although we can do much to discover which pieces fit 
		where, we need His guidance to complete the picture. As we work on the 
		puzzle and struggle trying pieces together for a fit, He guides us as he 
		helps us see a fit here or there that we hadnt noticed before. 
		Occasionally He will show us that an entire section of the puzzle fits 
		at the top of the picture, not at the bottom as we had imagined. Then we 
		keep working.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Turn to Proverbs 3:5-6: 
		Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I graduated from law 
		school, I felt like I should move back to the West. I researched various 
		cities and decided on Portland or Seattle. I felt good about this choice 
		and went to work applying for an internship that would hopefully lead to 
		a job. West Coast firms were not recruiting at Wake Forest, but I was 
		determined. While my friends were interviewing constantly with firms on 
		campus, I was getting rejection letters. A Seattle lawyer explained to 
		me that firms werent interested in having East Coast students spend the 
		summer interning only to return to a permanent job in the East. After 
		saving 50 rejection letters, I just started throwing them away. Still 
		undeterred, I flew to Seattle for my fall break on my meager student 
		budget. I hand delivered resumes to law firms all over the city. My main 
		memory of that trip is of sobbing in my hotel room, feeling discouraged, 
		overwhelmed, and lonely in a big city filled with fancy lawyers who 
		didnt want to hire me. Perhaps Joseph felt similarly when he arrived as 
		a slave in Egypt. I prayed that I would have the courage to keep trying 
		and that I would find the job the Lord had in mind for me. As I 
		concluded the trip, I found much to be grateful for: I had overcome a 
		number of fears and realized I could do things like figure out a city 
		bus system on my own. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">About the time I decided I 
		had been rejected by every firm Id applied to, and maybe even a few 
		others, I got a call from the recruiter at a Portland firm asking if Id 
		be willing to drive to another North Carolina school to interview the 
		following day. The interview went well, and the firm flew me to Portland 
		for a longer round of interviews. The next week I got a call offering me 
		the internship. I was ecstatic. The lawyer who called asked if I could 
		please let them know within two weeks whether Id be accepting. I was 
		afraid to say that of course I would accept, I had no other options, so 
		I called back with my acceptance a few days later. In hindsight, I 
		realized this was probably the law firm I would have chosen to work for 
		even if I had faced a large pile of job offers instead of rejection 
		letters. However, the choice would have been difficult and confusing for 
		a person who agonizes over a choice between ice cream flavors. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Turn with me now to Isaiah 
		55: 8-9.<b> </b>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your 
		ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the 
		earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your 
		thoughts. When were being guided to put puzzle pieces together that 
		dont seem likely to fit, we have to remember that we can only see parts 
		of the puzzle while the Lord is looking at the complete picture. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As thrilled as I was to have 
		landed a great job in Portland, I started working as a business lawyer 
		without any real preparation to work in that area of law. I did minor in 
		business (let me emphasize minor), and I didnt even take some of the 
		fundamental business law courses in law school. But when I went to work, 
		business was booming (this was before the dot.com crash), and my firm 
		needed corporate lawyers. So I went to work. It was clear to me that the 
		Lord had led me to this job at this time in my life.&nbsp; I remember 
		thinking to myself as I tried to catch a short nap on my office floor 
		after a long work night, what could this possibly have to do with my 
		lifes purpose? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A few years later when I felt 
		led, even called, to teach at BYUIdaho, it was truly a miracle that a 
		job became available for which I could qualify. The job description 
		asked for applicants with experience practicing business law as well as 
		the ability to teach a business communications course. The time I spent 
		practicing corporate law along with my undergraduate degree in 
		communications allowed me to meet the minimum qualifications. The Lord 
		wanted me to be here, and He knew that back when I was choosing a major 
		as an undergraduate, when I was deciding to go to law school, and when I 
		wound up practicing corporate law. It was all part of a master plan that 
		I could only understand in hindsight. Like Joseph, I could look back and 
		say with confidence, for God did send me. Now I only wish I had been 
		more faithful during the process. If I had trusted more fully that the 
		Lord was guiding me, I would have better appreciated my time working in 
		the business world; I would have been a better lawyer because I would 
		have been more focused; and I wouldnt have wasted time worrying about 
		my future. </font></p>

		Shortly after I was sustained in General Conference to be a General 
		Authority, I was to be ordained a Seventy by President Thomas S. Monson. 
		You can probably relate to this simple farm boys feelings of inadequacy 
		and awe as my wife and I walked into the beautifully paneled board room 
		in the Church Administration Building to meet with the First Presidency. 
		President Monson was very kind. He spent a few minutes sharing personal 
		experiences and counseling with us. Then, before he laid his hands on my 
		head to ordain me a Seventy and confer the sealing power, he looked at 
		me and said, Elder Jones, you are an uncommon, common man. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><font color="#000080">
		I come from a very common background. I was raised in very modest 
		conditions. I was not born a General Authority. My faithful father was 
		never a bishop or stake president. We lived in southwestern New Mexico 
		in the little village of Virden, population 136. My two brothers and I 
		shared one of two bedrooms in our small home. Dad was a farmer. When I 
		was little, we raised potatoes on our 80-acre farm, but we could not 
		compete with Idaho spuds, so Dad decided to grow cotton and alfalfa. I 
		spent long hours doing farm chores; hoeing, picking cotton, hauling hay, 
		driving the tractor, and irrigating the fields. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><font color="#000080">
		My wife did not marry a General Authority. She married me, a routine 
		returned missionary who never served as a zone leader or an assistant to 
		the president. I was studying Animal Science at BYU and dreamed of 
		someday raising cattle on a ranch. The thought of carrying the mantle of 
		a Seventy was not a part of even my wildest imaginations. I was a 
		common, simple guy with weaknesses that I was working to overcome.</font></p>

		Today, I am still a common man, but I happen to have a very special 
		calling as a Seventy, an especial witness of Jesus Christ. As with all 
		callings, I will someday be released as a Seventy, but I will continue 
		to be what I enjoy the most: a husband to my sweetheart. We will be Dad 
		and Mom to our children, and grandparents (or Nanny and Poppy) to our

		How can someone as common and simple as we are, become uncommon? We

		in between, but what is written gives us some revealing insight. </font>

		money on the dates. They were simple activities, but I got to know the

		As a thirteen-year-old deacons quorum president, one fast Sunday I 
		encouraged the entire deacons quorum to go up as a group to bear our 
		testimonies. Part of my motive was quite deaconish as I suggested, 
		Lets make the bishop faint. All of us went to the stand together, and 
		each of us bore his testimony, even the rascal of the group. When my 
		turn came, I stood to bear my testimony. I said only a few words and was 
		surprised to find myself in tears. Something happened that I had not 
		expected. I had shared a Primary testimony many times before, but this 
		was different. I was concerned about the health of a grandfather figure 
		in my life. A powerful feeling came into my heart, an assurance of Gods 
		eternal plan. The fire of testimony burned in my soul, and I knew that

		concern. It was not a lighthearted or exploratory attempt. God responded 
		because I followed a law. </font></p>

		Again I knelt down and pleaded for direction. As I stood, I felt a

		until it came to a point. There on the point was a lone pine tree with 
		two-by-fours nailed to the trunk allowing me to climb up and sit on a 
		plank that had been set across two branches, forming a lookout and 
		giving me an unobstructed view of the area. Within minutes I saw my son 
		and was able to join him. Coincidence one might say. I felt the nudges!! 
		We had never been in that forest before, but God knew it well. He knew

		scripture study and prayer. Looking back, I realize that I had developed 
		such a love and appetite for the scriptures that I even carried them 
		with me on the hunt. Regular scripture study keeps us close to Deity and 
		opens the door to divine communication. </font></p>

		Years ago I was given the assignment to speak in sacrament meeting on 
		the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Though I was reading my scriptures 
		regularly and had read about the Atonement, I had never studied the 
		Atonement in detail before. As I began to learn about this sacred 
		subject, I felt a hunger to understand every detail of that sublime 
		event. I devoured every verse, book, article, and talk on the subject 
		that I could get my hands on. My relationship with the Savior and 
		Heavenly Father advanced more during those few weeks than any time of my 
		life. I found myself talking to Heavenly Father on a much more regular 
		basis, more than just traditional prayer time. I recognized promptings 
		and answers were coming more often, and they were about aspects of my 
		life that had not been considered before. Specific direction came about 
		family, work, business, my church callings, and even what could be 
		considered trivial things. My relationship with God moved to a much 
		higher plane.</font></p>

		In the last few years I have been impressed by the number of people I 
		have counseled with who are facing unique special challenges. Almost 
		without exception, when I asked them how they cope with their situation,

		On one occasion I arrived early at a hotel and had some free time before 
		my assignment that night. The hotel had a beautiful, tranquil pool in 
		the patio. It was unoccupied, so I grabbed my scriptures and went out to 
		study. It was a gorgeous afternoon, and soon I was feasting on the 
		scriptures. You know how it feels when you are learning new principles, 
		and your mind and soul are being charged with spiritual truth. It was 
		one of those moments. While deep in the scriptures, I heard a door open 
		and out of the corner of my eye, I sensed a young woman coming toward 
		the pool in a bikini. It was a moment of decision. The common man would 
		turn and take in the sight. On this occasion I simply rotated my chair, 
		turning my back to the pool and continued with my studies. </font></p>

		What happened next is difficult for me to describe. I was already 
		feasting on the scriptures, but it seemed my study and understanding 
		ascended to an even higher intensity. I was taught and given confidence 
		in myself and my spiritual capacities and abilities that I had never 
		before contemplated. I felt, in the words of the Prophet Joseph, pure 
		intelligence flowing into me.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font size="1">12</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		That night as I performed my responsibilities, I was given a personal

		turned my back on temptation. The next day, I reread the chapters I had 
		studied out by the pool, to review again what I had learned. The new 
		concepts and principles I had learned were not written in those 
		chapters. In a sweet, miraculous manner I had been taught between the 
		lines. Looking back, I recognize that the principles I was taught that 
		day were of key importance in preparing me for the calling I have today.</font></p>

		I shared the swimming pool experience with my missionaries in zone

		counsel to heart. They told me that as they were walking down the street 
		an immodestly dressed young woman was walking toward them from the other 
		direction. They averted their eyes and after she had passed, almost 
		simultaneously said to each other, Did you look? Brethren, and in 
		todays society I must add Sisters, the uncommon man does not look, and 
		the uncommon sister does not dress so as to tempt him to look. Just 
		because everyone else does it, or the extremes of media tout that it

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Good afternoon, brothers and 
		sisters.&nbsp; I am so excited to spend some time with you here in the Hart 
		Auditorium.&nbsp; I have various members of my family on the stand with me 
		today and I was sitting next to my wife, and my ten year old daughter 
		looked over at me and I knew she wanted to say something. And so I 
		leaned over and I thought, perhaps she would share a word of 
		encouragement and she leaned real close and said, Dad, Aunt Katie has 
		her chickens and Im dying to see them!&nbsp; Which gave me, strangely 
		enough a bit of peace and comfort. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Also among my family members 
		today, on the stand is my grandmother Leola Helvin.&nbsp; She has deep roots 
		in this area and I am glad that she could join us today.&nbsp; My lifes been 
		blessed by the example of her faith in Jesus Christ, her sense of humor, 
		and the example that she has been to me.&nbsp; My grandma was a student at 
		this institution during the years of 1938 to 1939 when it was Ricks 
		College. She received her associate's degree in business in June of 
		1939.&nbsp; As you can imagine there have been some changes here since she 
		was a student. For example, when she was a student, there were only two 
		buildings on campus.&nbsp; My grandmother and the friends that she went to 
		college with experienced also different rules than you might experience 
		while you are here. &nbsp;In the residence hall there were certain rules 
		about notifying the resident proctors that you were leaving.&nbsp; When a 
		student would leave, they were required to sign a checkout sheet on 
		which the student's name, the person who was with them, and the nature 
		of their outing was recorded.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This picture shows one of 
		these checkout sheets. On this sheet, my grandmas name is listed along 
		with a young man name Ted Parkinson, who apparently had taken her to 'a 
		show.'&nbsp; The checkmarks by the names were placed there by the proctor, 
		indicating the student had returned.&nbsp; It looks like Ted successfully 
		returned my grandma to the dorm by the 10 p.m. curfew.&nbsp; My grandma has 
		kept several mementos of her time at this place. Its a time she 
		describes as 'wonderful.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she graduated from Rick's college, 
		this institution has experienced many powerful changes. &nbsp;Guided by 
		divine hands, and molded by the efforts of many humble, dedicated 
		employees and students over the decades, it has developed, it has 
		expanded and improved steadily.&nbsp; It has become a place of innovation.&nbsp; 
		You can see these blessings in our beautiful and expanding campus.&nbsp; More 
		students pass through our classrooms than ever before. New and powerful 
		ways of teaching and learning are being developed.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This place is still 
		changing.&nbsp; Still improving, and it never will cease to do so.&nbsp; It is, as 
		Elder David A. Bednar described, set apart as a temple of learning in 
		which if students take advantage of their time here, they will enter in 
		one condition and leave in a better one.&nbsp; BYUIdaho, I believe, is a 
		symbol of the kind of change Heavenly Father desires for each of us.&nbsp; 
		You are at a time in your lives that many of you might also describe as 
		wonderful.&nbsp; You have felt transformations within yourselves that have 
		brought excitement, energy and optimism.&nbsp; You feel the desire to develop 
		talents and skills that will help you confidently go forth and find 
		happiness, success and goodness in your lives.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Perhaps some of you have been 
		frustrated by the seeming lack of transformation, and wonder if the 
		changes you seek for yourself are possible.&nbsp; It can be both exciting and 
		also frustrating to ask yourself the question: If I could change 
		anything about myself, what would it be?&nbsp; In your quiet moments, when 
		you examine what you most desperately want for yourself, what do you 
		find?&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife was a student here, not many years ago and she described 
		to me the excitement she felt when she considered that her experience 
		here could be a starting point for her.&nbsp; Here she could decide how she 
		would turn out, and become something better than she felt she was 
		before.&nbsp; She wanted to become a better, new version of herself. Would 
		the prospect of becoming new excite you? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The apostle Paul described 
		how the most important change that can happen to us is brought about 
		through the atonement of Christ.&nbsp; In fact, he called this change 
		becoming &quot;a new creature&quot;.&nbsp; Becoming this new creature is a change each 
		of us must make to find &quot;peace in this life&quot; and to qualify for eternal 
		life in the world to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To become 'new' suggests a 
		transformation from an existing state. This transformation includes 
		experiences that have different names in the scriptures such as being 
		born again, having a mighty change of heart and being converted.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Perhaps many of you in this 
		audience have experienced significant transformation already in your 
		lives when you joined the church. You have felt the powerful blessing of 
		the atonement of Jesus Christ and made significant changes in order to 
		know the Savior. This may have begun when you were introduced to the 
		gospel by a friend, colleague or family member. You felt faith in Christ 
		which created in you a new, strong and real desire to repent.&nbsp; You were 
		baptized by water and by the Spirit as you participated in the sacred 
		ordinances by proper authority.&nbsp; Taking these steps has allowed you to 
		walk in the newness of life.&quot; &nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And perhaps some of you 
		hadn't fully started to feel a personal transformation until powerful 
		spiritual experiences, trials, or other circumstances were placed in 
		your lives by the Lord.&nbsp; Maybe these experiences helped you become a 
		convert, even though you were already a member of the church. This may 
		be happening to some of you as students here.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some of you have always been 
		members of the church and may not remember a time when you didn't feel 
		the beauty and power of the gospel in daily living.&nbsp; Yet, you feel a 
		longing to improve your efforts, your actions and your thoughts. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Finally, there may be some in 
		this room who have a hope for conversion, but aren't sure if they have 
		experienced it yet.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We may all indeed ask 
		ourselves am I converted?&nbsp; And how will I know?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many of us may have received 
		a spiritual witness that the gospel is true. This is one step toward 
		full conversion.&nbsp; However, knowing even deeply that Christ lives, is 
		only part of this conversion that must take place in each of us.&nbsp; Elder 
		Dallin H. Oaks said of the process of becoming what Heavenly Father 
		needs us to become:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		&quot;This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge.&nbsp; It is not 
		even enough for us to be convinced of the gospel; we must act and think 
		so that we are converted by it.&nbsp; In contrast to the institutions of the 
		world, which teach us to <i>know</i> something, the gospel of Jesus 
		Christ challenges us to <i>become</i> something.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;<br />
		Elder Oaks goes on to teach the difference between knowing and being 
		converted using Simon Peter as a reference point. Peter was a powerful 
		teacher of the gospel with a strong testimony.&nbsp; There was no 
		question&nbsp;that Peter knew the truth of, and was committed to the gospel.&nbsp; 
		Yet, at the Last Supper the Savior told Simon Peter: I have prayed for 
		thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen 
		thy brethren. &nbsp;Elder Oaks explains:&nbsp;If any of us relies solely upon 
		our knowledge and testimony of the gospel, we are in the same position 
		as the blessed but still unfinished Apostles whom Jesus challenged to be 
		converted.&nbsp; We must understand that conversion includes, but is more 
		than just knowing.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Perhaps in the past we have 
		confused obedience with conversion. While obedience is indeed important 
		and even critical in becoming a new creature, it is a means to an end, 
		and not the end itself.&nbsp; Elder Oaks goes on to explain:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		&quot;The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and 
		evil actswhat we have done.&nbsp; It is an acknowledgment of the final 
		effect of our acts and thoughtswhat we have become.&nbsp; It is not enough 
		for anyone just to go through the motions.&nbsp; The commandments, 
		ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits 
		required to be made in some heavenly account.&nbsp; The gospel of Jesus 
		Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our heavenly Father 
		desires us to become.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters the Lord 
		loves and is pleased by His children who consistently do as they are 
		asked, but certainly conversion implies even more than this.&nbsp; We learn 
		from the Lord's counsel to the prophet Samuel that &quot;man <i>looketh</i> 
		on<i> the</i> outward appearance, but <i>the</i><b> </b>Lord <i>looketh</i> 
		on <i>the</i> <i>heart</i>.&quot;&nbsp; When we are converted, we see the reason 
		for our obedience clearly, and we offer it willingly.&nbsp; Do we fulfill our 
		callings or other responsibilities in the gospel because it helps us 
		avoid inconvenience in a culture where that is the acceptable standard?&nbsp; 
		Because we are mortal, we sometimes find discrepancies between our 
		actions, even when they are well-intentioned, and the inner feelings of 
		our hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was a young boy, I 
		learned about this discrepancy that can occur between our outward 
		actions and our true feelings.&nbsp; Like some of you I was blessed to grow 
		up learning gospel principles in what I felt was a 'large' family.&nbsp; I 
		was the second of six children, and the only boy.&nbsp; Because boys 
		sometimes feel the need to distinguish themselves from little girls, I 
		became skilled at antagonizing my sisters.&nbsp; One evening, my older sister 
		Heather and I were engaged in a running battle.&nbsp; I would harass her, and 
		she would reciprocate.&nbsp; Our teasing and tussling escalated until we 
		became very upset at each other.&nbsp; We were soon both in tears, and our 
		fighting continued until our exasperated mother knew that she had to 
		intervene.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Taking each of us by the arm 
		she escorted us into her bedroom and described how she would put an end 
		to our discord.&nbsp; Letting go of us, she told my sister and I to face each 
		other.&nbsp;I knew this couldnt be good.&nbsp; My mom then explained, in a 
		stern voice that we would each be required to hug each other for one 
		full minute in order to show that we love each other!&nbsp; With tears 
		still flowing, we hesitated until she explained the longer we waited, 
		the longer we would be stuck in the room together.&nbsp; We approached each 
		other holding our arms out, and tried our hardest to create the 
		appearance of an embrace without actually having the skin of our arms 
		touch.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I remember holding my arms in 
		a perfect circle providing enough room for my sister to fit within my 
		hug without actually any physical contact.&nbsp; She did the same thing, and 
		we stood this way for a full minute, tears running down our faces.&nbsp; This 
		resolved our conflict, but only because the idea of another full minute 
		of hugging was threat enough to end our fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have since learned to 
		love and cherish my sisters.&nbsp; I learned from this experience that being 
		obedient was not necessarily being converted. My outward actions 
		manifested obedience, and the appearance of 'loving' my sister, but my 
		inward feelings were in conflict. Now this is a playful example and its 
		one that suggests this conflict that happens between us, but there are 
		other instances in our lives when we may examine ourselves and say, and 
		what Im doing, is what Im doing matching what Im feeling inside?&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We must understand that 
		conversion includes, but is more than just being obedient.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So what is it to be 
		converted?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Marion G. Romney 
		described conversion in the following way: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&quot;Conversion means to turn 
			from one belief or course of action to another.&nbsp; Conversion is a 
			spiritual and moral change. In one who is really wholly converted, 
			desire for things contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ has 
			actually died. Membership in the Church and conversion are not 
			necessarily synonymous. Being converted and having a testimony are 
			not necessarily the same thing either ... Conversion is the <i>fruit</i> 
			or the reward for repentance and obedience.&quot; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Again, in our quiet moments 
		when we really examine what we want for ourselves, do we find that our 
		desire for things contrary to the gospel has died?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or do we keep that 
		desire for some things on life support because some temptations are 
		particularly entertaining, exciting or intriguing to us.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I suggest we can measure our 
		conversion not by what we know, believe or even do sometimes, but how 
		closely our thoughts, feelings and desires compare to those of the 
		Savior.&nbsp; This can be sobering when we realize that while we may have 
		strong testimonies and consistently fulfill our church and family 
		responsibilitieswe may have work to do in aligning our motivations, 
		desires and feelings.&nbsp; However, if our personal inventory causes us to 
		become discouraged, I suggest it is because we have lost track of two 
		important principles.&nbsp; One, that conversion is more a process than an 
		event.&nbsp; And two, we cannot experience conversion without the power of 
		the atonement. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This process happens on 
		different timelines for each of us.&nbsp; In describing the miraculous 
		conversions that are recorded in the Book of Mormon Elder D. Todd 
		Cristofferson explained: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		&quot;You may ask, why doesn't this mighty change happen more quickly with 
		me? You should remember that the remarkable examples of King Benjamin's 
		people, Alma, and some others in scripture are just that-remarkable and 
		not typical. For most of us, the changes are more gradual and occur over 
		time. Being born again, unlike our physical birth, is more a process 
		than an event, and engaging in that process is the central purpose of 
		mortality.&quot; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A few weeks ago in a family 
		council setting my wife and I were discussing with our small children 
		the struggle that we sometimes feel in reconciling our feelings to our 
		actions in ways that enable us to move toward Heavenly Father and not 
		away from him.&nbsp; We talked about the times we feel jealousy, anger, 
		annoyance, and pride and frustration and how yielding to those 
		influences takes us down a path of action that is out of line with our 
		divine potential.&nbsp; My ten-year old daughter Celeste, who is very bright, 
		pondered this.&nbsp; She furrowed her brow and asked, 'Yeah, but isn't it 
		natural to feel these things?&quot;&nbsp; I told her yes, it was and then we read 
		together Mosiah 3:19 which teaches about these 'natural' tendencies. If 
		you will join me, lets turn to Mosiah 3:19.&nbsp; The scripture says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was touched by my 
		daughter's question, because I knew she was starting to discover the 
		challenge that will be hers, mine and yours for the rest of our lives: 
		to develop feelings, thoughts and actions that are compatible with our 
		knowledge of what is right.&nbsp; To become a new creature requires putting 
		off the natural man.&nbsp; I had the feeling that as my daughter considered 
		her natural tendencies, she was starting to think, &quot;Wow this will be a 
		lot of work.&quot;&nbsp;And it is. &nbsp;I wanted my daughter to also know that we 
		don't have to do this on our own.&nbsp; When we look further into this 
		scripture we find hope and optimism in two very small words: <i>yields</i> 
		and <i>through</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&quot;The word yields in Mosiah 
		3:19 shows the encouragement of our loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; The 
		scripture says: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		&quot;The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, 
		and will be forever and ever, unless he <i>yields</i> to the enticing of 
		the Holy Spirit.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One definition of the word 
		yield is to give up and to cease resistance or contention.&nbsp; Another is 
		to give way to pressure or influence. &nbsp;By both definitions, the 
		scripture suggests there are influences already being applied to us.&nbsp; 
		Perhaps the only obstacle in letting the Spirit have full sway in our 
		hearts, is our own either stubborn or even unconscious resistance.&nbsp; At 
		times perhaps our inability to perceive the enticings of the Spirit 
		isn't because they are absent, but because our desire to them to yield 
		to them, has not been fully developed.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I learned another lesson 
		about yielding to the Spirit a few years ago.&nbsp; I had served in the young 
		men's organization of a ward where my young family and I lived before we 
		moved here.&nbsp; I became friends with the other advisors and scout leaders. 
		We went on many campouts together, fended off affectionate group attacks 
		from our deacons together and taught together on Sundays.&nbsp; This kind of 
		experience can form a solidarity among young men's leaders that many of 
		you men in this audience will experience, if you havent done so. &nbsp;A 
		short time after my wife and I moved from the ward, I received news that 
		one of the advisors I had served with had died.&nbsp; I was confused because 
		he was a young, strong and healthy man. One afternoon his young wife had 
		come home, and&nbsp;discovered him lying unconscious upon their bed, and 
		attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.&nbsp; Investigation revealed 
		that&nbsp;the circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious.&nbsp; It was 
		later discovered that&nbsp;somebody had entered his home and taken his life.&nbsp; 
		Little else was known.&nbsp; My wife and I were shocked and saddened, and we 
		had never experienced anything like this before and were uneasy as we 
		prepared to attend the funeral.&nbsp; Before the services, I was looking at 
		pictures arranged by this young mans family in the lobby of the church 
		building.&nbsp; It seemed such a senseless tragedy that he was gone, and soon 
		I had allowed feelings of sadness and even anger to overcome me.&nbsp; I even 
		carried these feelings with me into the memorial service.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As the funeral progressed, 
		this young man's father spoke.&nbsp; He had been our Bishop and my wife and I 
		had great admiration and affection for him.&nbsp; As he taught the plan of 
		salvation, and the truths about a loving Heavenly Father the Spirit 
		filled the chapel.&nbsp; This good man, speaking at his own sons funeral, 
		taught us that regardless of the circumstances in which each of us leave 
		this life, the most important thing is the condition we are in when we 
		are called home to our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; As he spoke, I began to sense 
		new and brighter thoughts and feelings begin to stir within me.&nbsp; As the 
		Spirit ministered to us, I realized that I could actually feel peace.&nbsp; 
		And for&nbsp;a very&nbsp;brief moment I realized I had a choice to make.&nbsp; It was a 
		very pointed and powerful experience I had never been conscious before 
		of making a choice on how to feel. I could either yield to the enticing 
		of the Spirit or continue on a path of sadness and bitterness.&nbsp; At that 
		moment, it was a conscious relaxation of resistance happening within 
		me.&nbsp; As I yielded to the Spirit, my thoughts turned to the plan of 
		Salvation, the grace of the Atonement and my own need to strive to 
		become better during the time that I have left in my own life.&nbsp; I knew 
		that Heavenly Father had all things before him.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There will be times when we 
		become conscious of our choice to yield to the enticings of the Spirit 
		or to the natural man.&nbsp; These will come in moments of temptation, 
		decision or even opportunity.&nbsp; If we yield correctly, we will begin to 
		develop the spiritual reflexes rather than rely on our 'natural' ones.&nbsp; 
		A few years ago Elder Richard G. Scott visited our campus and spoke to 
		the employees.&nbsp; He counseled us, and suggested we would do well to 
		understand, and then help our students understand, the need to develop 
		these spiritual reflexes.&nbsp; I believe spiritual reflexes are the 
		inclinations we have to act in holy ways when faced with decisions, 
		trials, perceived injustices, temptations or opportunities to serve.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Spiritual reflexes come as a result of patterns we have set for 
		ourselves in the way we use our minds, spirits and bodies.&nbsp; They are not 
		easy to develop but they are strong, or weak to the degree that they 
		have been developed or neglected.&nbsp; I'd like to share a story that may 
		help us consider the nature of reflexes.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">During my freshman year at 
		BYU in Provo, my roommate and I decided to take a martial arts class 
		together as an elective one semester.&nbsp; We were impressed with our 
		teacher, who was a very skilled martial artist, and he described to us 
		how an expert will practice punches, kicks and forms until they become 
		deeply ingrained in his or her mind and body.&nbsp; Such 'muscle memory' 
		would be useful when called upon in defensive situations where reflexes 
		would need to take over.&nbsp; Our teacher told us of an experience in which 
		he and some other students once gave an exhibition with their 
		instructor, he was a multi-level black belt, and this was to be done 
		during the half-time of a basketball game. The exhibition was 
		choreographed to showcase the various techniques, and defensive moves in 
		a simulated multi-person attack.&nbsp; Our teacher recounted that during the 
		exhibition he found himself slightly out of step with the planned 
		choreography, and consequently found himself in a different position 
		than practiced.&nbsp; As he approached his instructor from behind, the 
		instructor turned and instinctively and reflexively altered his moves 
		and struck our teacher with some force in the nose.&nbsp; Our teacher was 
		stunned, but did his best to continue with the rest of the exhibition. 
		Afterwards he was talking with his instructor about the incident, and 
		the instructor explained to him that he had been out of position, and it 
		was a position that was unplanned and unanticipated. So his instructor 
		naturally reacted based on training and reflexes he had developed over 
		the years. He seemed, almost to react at the exact time a perceived 
		threat was detected.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Learning to yield to 
		spiritual reflexes will help us in our journey to become a new creature. 
		As with anything that is practiced, the more we do this, the more we 
		will find our spiritual reflexes becoming stronger than our natural 
		tendencies.&nbsp; We will yield to being charitable when we naturally feel 
		angry or feel like gossiping.&nbsp; We will yield to being forgiving when 
		bitterness may seem justified. &nbsp;We will yield to serving others, when 
		meeting our own needs seems important. We will yield to purity when 
		inappropriate media or pornography is readily available.&nbsp; We will yield 
		to honesty when a perceived advantage could be gained by bending the 
		truth. And we will ultimately yield to Christ when the glittering but 
		hollow enticements of the adversary inevitably present themselves to us 
		and to our families. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I mentioned earlier the 
		other word of hope in Mosiah 3:19 us the word <i>through</i><b>.</b>&nbsp; 
		The scripture describes how putting off the natural man and becoming a 
		saint will happen <i>through</i> the atonement. It is true that our own 
		consistent and diligent effort to make and keep sacred covenants will 
		influence our becoming a new creature but it will not be enough. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Cristofferson described 
		the relationship between the Savior's role and our role in bringing this 
		change about:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&quot;It 
		was Jesus who stated that entry into the kingdom of God requires that 
		one be born again of water and of the Spirit. His teaching about a 
		physical and a spiritual baptism helps us understand that <i>both our 
		own action and the intervention of divine power</i> are needed for this 
		transformative rebirth-for the change from natural man to saint. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our 'own action' initially 
		means acting on our faith in Christ to repent and being baptized, and be 
		baptized and receive the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; It also necessarily includes 
		continuing to make choices that strengthen our testimony, and qualify us 
		for the continued cleansing and strengthening influence of the 
		atonement.&nbsp;One of the things that is required of us in this combination 
		of acting and receiving help from a divine influence, is to give up all 
		of our sins. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When Aaron, the brother of 
		Ammon spoke to King Lamonis father, he discussed with him what would be 
		required to know Heavenly Father. King Lamonis father described how he 
		wanted to understand this relationship that could happen. He said he 
		would give up all of his sins for this to take place. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we reflect and we do an 
		inventory of our sins we realize that even our favorite ones must be 
		given up to know Heavenly Father. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was a freshman at BYU, 
		again I learned a lot of things that year and subsequent years. I had 
		understood the need to be in a position where I was willing to give up 
		things that would keep me from understanding my Heavenly Father. &nbsp;My 
		roommate and I would drink soda pop by the can and pretty soon we had an 
		entire soda pop pyramid built in our dorm room. It stretched nearly to 
		the ceiling. After a few weeks, I began to observe that it grew taller 
		and taller, but I also observed something else about myself. I observed 
		that my grades were not what they should be.&nbsp; I looked at my soda pop 
		can mountain and realized they were probably a symbol of where my 
		attention was when it shouldnt have been there. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One night I came home after 
		having failed a math test, never having failed a test in my academic 
		life before, and I looked upon my soda pop mountain.&nbsp; It was, it was 
		late and my roommate was asleep but I decided then and there that I 
		needed to give up what was keeping me from becoming what I needed to 
		become. I grabbed a trash bag and I began to fill the soda can mountain. 
		I filled it completely to the top. I spent an hour that night late in 
		the dark, cleaning my room, and then putting my homework on my desk.&nbsp; 
		Then said to my Father in Heaven, I know I have not done what has been 
		required of me.&nbsp; I know I need to give up certain things that are 
		standing between me and what I need to be.&nbsp; And I prayed for His help. 
		I prayed for His guidance and I prayed for the desire to be what I 
		needed to be and for the strength to do it. That was a turning point for 
		me as a young man.&nbsp; A very powerful experience that helped me understand 
		even the small things, things from distractions to sins, will be 
		required to be given up to know Heavenly Father in this path and become 
		a new creature. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I said before, however, 
		with divine intervention it will not be possible. It will not be by 
		sheer force of will that we are changed into a state suitable for the 
		presence of God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><br />
		Elder David A Bednar said of the mighty change of heart that is key to 
		our conversion, This mighty change is not simply the result of working 
		harder or developing greater individual discipline, rather it is the 
		consequence of the fundamental change in our desires, in our motives, 
		and our natures, made possible through the atonement of Christ the 
		Lord. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our spiritual purpose is to 
		overcome both sin and the desire to sin.&nbsp; Both the taint and the 
		tyranny of sin. The process of conversion itself is a blessing because 
		through it our very nature, disposition, desires, thoughts, and hearts 
		are changed allowing us to return to the Father &quot;in his own time, in his 
		own way, and according to his own will. &nbsp;Only such a process could 
		allow the Atonement to transform our spirits and bodies into an 
		acceptable state for entry into Heavenly Father's presence.&nbsp;Becoming a 
		new creature takes time, and it takes effort.&nbsp; But it can ultimately 
		only happen through the Atonement. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, of all 
		the changes that each of us desires for ourselves, the most important 
		change that each of us must experience is to become a new creature. &nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I want to bear testimony to 
		you that I know Heavenly Father knows you.&nbsp; In closing Ill share one 
		more personal experience. When I was a young boy, my father took me 
		fishing.&nbsp; I think I wasnt much older than my ten year old daughter, 
		Celeste, but we went up to a place called Oddgers Creek where he had 
		described to me, he had gone fishing with his father as a young man. And 
		so we had planned for this day, and we packed our gear, and we got 
		everything aligned. And we went to this place and it was everything that 
		I had imagined.&nbsp; We spent most of the morning fishing, enjoying our time 
		together, drinking root beer, and just doing everything a little boy 
		would think is the best thing to do.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
		Later in the afternoon my father told me he wanted to explore the creek 
		and go up further.&nbsp; He said, Now Ill be back and dont you worry, Im 
		just going to be really close. As he left, I watched him walk up the 
		creek and depart into the brush. And pretty soon in little boy time, I 
		felt like a long period of time had passed.&nbsp; I began to be concerned.&nbsp; I 
		wondered where my father was.&nbsp; I was wondering what he was doing, and if 
		he had indeed made it to where he was going, and if he would return 
		shortly. Pretty soon my mind started to reflect upon this and I believe 
		I was making myself more anxious that I needed to be.&nbsp; But my parents 
		had taught me in situations like this that you kneel and you pray, and 
		so I opened up the truck door, got down on the floorboards and kneeled 
		and said a prayer. In my prayer I asked Heavenly Father to please 
		protect my father that he could return home, return back to me and be 
		safe and that we could be joined together again and enjoy the rest of 
		our day.&nbsp; I continued this way for what seemed like hours, but in 
		reality was probably only five or six minutes. And soon, I looked up and 
		out of the aspen trees came my father with his fishing pole.&nbsp; He hadnt 
		caught anything, by the way. But he had explored the creek a little bit 
		and had come back and in this period of time, I was worried that 
		something had happened to him. As I watched him come out of the trees, I 
		was so excited and so pleased and so anxious to go and greet him and to 
		be with him and to have this anxiety relieved. And I threw my arms 
		around him around his waist and told him I loved him and then we went 
		and got the root beer out of the creek and we went on with our day.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At that moment I knew and 
		experienced maybe a fraction of what it would be like for us to be 
		reunited with our Father in Heaven. He knows us. He knows our 
		weaknesses.&nbsp; He knows our strengths.&nbsp; And His desire for us to return to 
		Him is very powerful and eternal. It is only through the Atonement and 
		as we yield to the enticings in our spiritual reflexes that we can 
		become this new creature.&nbsp; And it is a desire that is His and that He 
		wants each of us to experience. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I bear testimony of the 
		Atonement of Jesus Christ of its power to heal; of its power to make you 
		what you need to be; and to become the best version of yourself. I love 
		the Savior and I thank Him for what He has helped me to understand about 
		my relationship with our Heavenly Father. I pray that we may all 
		understand this and know of His love for us as we travel in our journey 
		to become a new creature.&nbsp; And I leave these things with you in the name 
		of Jesus Christ, amen. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is an honor for Sister 
		Jolley and me to be here with you this afternoon.&nbsp; We feel very much at 
		home.&nbsp; President and Sister Clark are wonderful hosts.&nbsp; Sister Jolley 
		and I met here at Ricks, now BYUIdaho, more than 50 years ago.&nbsp; We met 
		as we took a U.S. Government class in the old Spori Building.&nbsp; I am 
		happy for its reconstruction.&nbsp; It has special memories for us.&nbsp; She was 
		a pretty lass, just fresh off a farm here in Madison County.&nbsp; I had just 
		returned from a mission to Argentina.&nbsp; While pursuing this interest I 
		went to the farm one day during haying season looking for her and found 
		that I had arrived at the same time as another interested suitor.&nbsp; 
		Sister Jolleys father was very wise and a little short-handed of help 
		that day.&nbsp; He gave each of us a pitchfork.&nbsp; The other fellow pitched 
		from one side of the wagon and me the other.&nbsp; Jills father drove the 
		tractor pulling the wagon.&nbsp; She remained on the wagon tromping the hay.&nbsp; 
		Thats how it was done in those days.&nbsp; Obviously, my performance was the 
		most impressive to both her and her dad.&nbsp; I won her hand and the rest is 
		history.&nbsp; Im just glad her father didnt require me to work for 
		fourteen years for her hand as was the case with Jacob in finally 
		getting Rachel.&nbsp; Had it been required, I would have complied.&nbsp; She is a 
		gem and I love her dearly.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, besides meeting my 
		eternal companion here at this school, my roots go even deeper than 
		that.&nbsp; I was born in a small frame house situated within 100 feet from 
		where I am presently standing and the construction site for the new 
		auditorium was my childhood playground.&nbsp; It is exciting to see what has 
		happened to Rexburg and Ricks College, now Brigham Young 
		University-Idaho.&nbsp; It is a miracle.&nbsp; The Lord has had a hand in all 
		this.&nbsp; It is my witness that President Clark is here today as an 
		instrument in the hands of the Lord to insure the fulfillment of 
		prophetic utterances and directives from modern day prophets.&nbsp; Sister 
		Jolley and I are currently privileged to serve on the Presidents 
		Advancement Council.&nbsp; President Clarks vision and understanding of the 
		Lords wishes pertaining to BYUIdaho are unmistakably clear and 
		articulate.&nbsp; I applaud his leadership in inaugurating the Learning Model 
		as the prime method of instruction here at BYUIdaho.&nbsp; Sister Jolley and 
		I have experienced first hand the application of the Learning Model.&nbsp; 
		This past semester we took a class here at the University in Low Stress 
		Livestock Handling.&nbsp; Since returning from Brazil we have purchased a 
		small herd of cattle for our ranch which is located near the BYUIdaho 
		Livestock Center west of town.&nbsp; In our class, we were not only required 
		to learn the principles taught by the instructors, but as we learned, we 
		were required to teach other students these same principles, just as the 
		other students were required to teach us.&nbsp; Each class began with 
		prayer.&nbsp; Spiritual ideas and thoughts were co-mingled with all we 
		learned and all we did.&nbsp; Our two professors understood the Learning 
		Model well and followed its concepts perfectly.&nbsp; I applaud and thank 
		them for embracing and putting into practice the Learning Model.&nbsp; The 
		Spirit of Ricks was ever present.&nbsp; Thats kind of a long preface to the 
		message I would like to leave with you today but I have had some rather 
		strong feelings and impressions about the things I have mentioned.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I enjoyed my mission in 
		Argentina as a young man.&nbsp; But for that mission I would not be standing 
		before you today.&nbsp; It changed my life completely and forever.&nbsp; When I 
		left Argentina in 1956 feelings about missionary work had sunk deeply 
		into my soul.&nbsp; I wanted missionary work, which is, sharing the gospel 
		with all those around me, to be a way of life continually.&nbsp; A full-time 
		mission is invaluable while in the full-time service of the Lord and it 
		gives the added blessing of laying a foundation for a life-time service 
		of missionary work.&nbsp; Those feelings about being a missionary have been a 
		constant in my life.&nbsp; With that mind-set, opportunities to share the 
		gospel abound at every turn.&nbsp; Even today, when a telemarketer calls our 
		home I tell them I will hear you out as you extol the virtues of your 
		product if you will give me equal time to let me tell you about the 
		coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of Christs true 
		Church to the earth in these latter days.&nbsp; Many of them hang up at that 
		point.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Jesus began His earthly

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Jesus was completing His

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Following His resurrection 
		and prior to His final ascension Jesus appeared to his disciples for the 
		third time at the Sea of Tiberias and after they had finished eating he 
		said to Simon Peter:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?&nbsp; He saith unto

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is no better way to 
		show our love for the Savior than by feeding His sheep.&nbsp; Translating 
		that into todays parlance, that means sharing the gospel.&nbsp; Many of you 
		are returned missionaries.&nbsp; Your service is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Many 
		of you are planning missions.&nbsp; That is wonderful.&nbsp; That is expected of 
		you.&nbsp; But it is not enough.&nbsp; It doesnt stop there.&nbsp; That is only the 
		beginning.&nbsp; During President David O. McKays service as prophet, he 
		gave renewed emphasis to missionary work by urging every member to make 
		a commitment to bring at least one new member into the Church each year 
		during their lifetime.&nbsp; He became well known for his repeated 
		admonition:&nbsp; Every member a missionary.&nbsp; That directive from an 
		earlier prophet has never been rescinded and remains in full force and 
		effect today.&nbsp; Every member a missionary continues to be our war cry 
		for missionary work today.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, why would I treat this 
		subject here at the University today?&nbsp; I hope and pray that you fully 
		understand what is happening or should be happening to you spiritually 
		while here at BYUIdaho.&nbsp; There is no school like it anywhere in the 
		whole world.&nbsp; President Clark spoke to the student body about the 
		Spirit of Ricks at a devotional on September 18<sup>th</sup> last 
		year.&nbsp; I quote from his message:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		The Spirit of Ricks is the defining characteristic of BYUIdaho.&nbsp; It is 
		something we share as a university community.&nbsp; We experience the Spirit 
		of Ricks because individual students and individual employees receive 
		spiritual light and use spiritual gifts.&nbsp; The ministry of the Holy Ghost 
		and the manifestations of the Spirit at BYUIdaho are particularly 
		focused on disciple preparation, leadership development, and inspired 
		learning and teaching.&nbsp; I believe that by looking closely at the gifts 
		of the Spirit  which give the Spirit of Ricks its distinctive character 
		 we might gain some deeper insight into what the Lord wants each of us 
		to do to preserve and enhance it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Something almost inexplicable 
		happens to us in a very personal way when we let that which goes on 
		about us permeate our very being.&nbsp; I am talking about that which is here 
		to nourish your soul while at BYUIdaho.&nbsp; Just to name a few; the code 
		of honor, learning in a spiritual atmosphere pursuant to the recently 
		adopted Learning Model which I alluded to earlier, full participation in 
		all your ward and stake meetings and activities on Sundays and other 
		days, living in University approved housing with other students fully 
		endorsed by their bishops  what could be better preparation for a 
		lifetime of missionary service.&nbsp; To help you understand what happens to 
		a young person who comes here and becomes completely immersed in all 
		that the school has to offer -- may I share a personal experience 
		relating to one of our children.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was called to serve in 
		the Quorum of the Seventy our youngest daughter, Jenny, was just 17 
		years old and had just graduated from high school.&nbsp; Our first assignment 
		was in Brazil.&nbsp; As it turned out we served there for seven years.&nbsp; One 
		of the most difficult things I have ever had to do in my life was to 
		leave our baby at home, knowing that we would be gone for a long 
		time.&nbsp; We made arrangements for her to stay with an older married 
		daughter who also lives here in Rexburg.&nbsp; She wanted to attend what was 
		then Ricks College.&nbsp; We had worried about Jenny during her high school 
		years because of her choice of friends.&nbsp; They werent really bad, but in 
		the opinion of her parents, they were lacking, a bit, in some areas.&nbsp; 
		After fall semester started it wasnt long until Jenny decided she 
		wanted to live with other girls in college approved housing.&nbsp; That 
		turned out to be a great blessing in her life.&nbsp; She had three other 
		roommates who were super good and wonderful examples for her.&nbsp; They 
		bonded early on and formed friendships which have continued to this 
		day.&nbsp; Something happened to Jenny while here as this school.&nbsp; I think 
		thats why we call it the Spirit of Ricks today.&nbsp; After two years here 
		and an associate degree, Jenny called us in Brazil and informed us that 
		she wanted to serve a full-time mission.&nbsp; Needless to say, Sister Jolley 
		and I were extremely pleased.&nbsp; Jenny had always been a bit shy, at least 
		around her parents.&nbsp; She fulfilled an honorable mission in Guayaquil, 
		Ecuador.&nbsp; When she finished her mission Sister Jolley and I flew from 
		our home in São Paulo to Guayaquil to pick her up.&nbsp; While there we had 
		an opportunity to do some missionary work with her.&nbsp; She was not afraid 
		to open her mouth and bear witness to the truthfulness of the restored 
		gospel to anyone she met.&nbsp; She was fearless.&nbsp; Our Jenny was a different 
		girl.&nbsp; Well, she went on to greater things.&nbsp; She returned to now BYUIdaho, 
		met the love of her life, they were married, graduated together with 
		Bachelors degrees and I suppose will live happily ever after.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I tell you that story to help 
		you understand what can happen to you personally and spiritually here at 
		BYUIdaho if you open your heart and your mind to all that goes on 
		here.&nbsp; I underscore The Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; I understand what that is.&nbsp; 
		We have a granddaughter who had the same experience here as Jenny.&nbsp; She 
		is currently serving a mission Argentina.&nbsp; We have another granddaughter 
		currently enrolled here.&nbsp; She came all the way from Mesa, Arizona.&nbsp; She 
		loves it and has completely immersed herself in the Spirit of Ricks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now, what does all this have 
		to do with missionary work?&nbsp; It has to do with your faith and your 
		personal conversion, which can be refined and solidified while enjoying 
		this unusually unique and spiritual atmosphere.&nbsp; When your conversion 
		and faith are unquestioned something happens to you.&nbsp; It is natural for 
		you to be desirous to share the gospel with others.&nbsp; The Lord has so 
		instructed us:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have 
		you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy 
		faith fail not: and when thou are converted, strengthen thy brethren.&nbsp;
		</font><span style="color: #000080">(Luke 22:31-32)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Who are your brethren?&nbsp; It 
		could be a roommate, a family member, an acquaintance or a non-member.&nbsp; 
		To help you see yourself in a lifetime role as a missionary influencing 
		the lives of non-members, less-active members or members whose faith is 
		lacking to any degree, I refer to Enos in the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; Enos was 
		the son of Jacob.&nbsp; He was taught in the nurture and admonition of the 
		Lord.&nbsp; He went on a hunting trip.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080"></font><span style="color: #000080">Behold, 
		I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often 
		heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the 
		saints, sunk deep into my heart.&nbsp; And my soul hungered; and I kneeled 
		down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and 
		supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; 
		yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it 
		reached the heavens.&nbsp; And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy 
		sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<span style="color: #000080">Now, it came to pass that when I had heard 
		these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the 
		Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.&nbsp; (Enos 
		1:3-5, 9)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Now, I dont think 
		that Enos had done anything really bad in his life.&nbsp; Perhaps a few 
		foolish things, a few things out of character, however, he felt he 
		needed to get these few things cleared up in order for the Holy Ghost to 
		be his constant companion.&nbsp; Weve all experienced that.&nbsp; And we know 
		that adjustments and course corrections are necessary for the spirit to 
		return.&nbsp; And that is what Enos did.&nbsp; Now the miracle of it all, because 
		Enos knowing that he had been forgiven of whatever he did to be 
		deprived of the spirit and because of his faith in Christ and when he 
		forgot about himself, he began to feel a desire for the welfare of his 
		brethren, Nephites and Lamanites alike.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">The same thing happens 
		to all of us as we strive to have the spirit with us.&nbsp; Some of the 
		greatest joy and greatest moments of happiness you will ever experience 
		in this life will result in your sharing the gospel with others, 
		non-members and members alike.</span></p>

		made the necessary repairs.&nbsp; He was really a personable chap.&nbsp; I asked 
		the church employee who accompanied him if he had given him a copy of 
		the Book of Mormon and explained to him anything about the restoration 
		of the gospel.&nbsp; He replied he had not.&nbsp; In the presence of the plumber, 
		I told the church employee to repent and be a better missionary and that 
		the plumber seemed like a nice sort of guy and was probably one of the 
		elect.&nbsp; They both smiled.&nbsp; I then asked the plumber if he wasnt just a 
		little bit curious about the nearby beautiful temple, the stake house 
		and the administrative offices located on this church complex.&nbsp; He 
		replied that he was just a little bit curious.&nbsp; I said, thats good, we 
		are going to send the missionaries to your home to tell you all about it 
		and give you a copy of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; We did and in a few weeks 
		he and his wife were baptized.&nbsp; A year later he came to the temple with 
		his young family to be sealed and they are now an eternal family and 
		enjoying fellowship with the saints there in São Paulo, Brazil.&nbsp; I tell 
		you that story to illustrate that as we go through life we will have 
		numerous opportunities to invite people to come unto Christ.&nbsp; We should

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">

		Over the years we have issued appeals to the less active, the offended,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Let me share one final 
		story about a lady in Mesa, Arizona.&nbsp; While serving as President of the 
		Texas Corpus Christi, now Texas McAllen Mission, I was summoned to an 
		Area Council meeting in Mesa, Arizona.&nbsp; Elder Gene R. Cook of the 
		Seventy was serving in the Area Presidency and conducting the Saturday 
		morning training session.&nbsp; He advised us that the meeting would be 
		postponed until the mission presidents and stake presidents who were in 
		attendance were paired off in companionships and went out as 
		missionaries to call on church members who had been absent from the 
		church for a number of years.&nbsp; My stake president companion was fairly 
		young and fairly new on the job.&nbsp; Before we left the chapel we had a 
		brief word of prayer and I picked up a hymn book to take along with my 
		scriptures.&nbsp; We knew we had to do something to invite the spirit to be 
		with us during our visit.&nbsp; The person we were assigned to call on was a 
		middle aged lady who had had nothing to do with the church for more than 
		10 years.&nbsp; She was a widow.&nbsp; Her name was Sister Lockhart.&nbsp; We knocked 
		on her door about 9:00 a.m. that Saturday morning.&nbsp; She opened the door 
		only a few inches.&nbsp; I introduced ourselves and asked if we could come in 
		and share a gospel message and that we were representing local church 
		officials.&nbsp; Reluctantly she permitted us to step inside the doorway.&nbsp; I 
		asked if we could go into her living room.&nbsp; She didnt say anything but 
		stepped aside which we interpreted as a partial positive response.&nbsp; 
		After sitting I asked her if she would kneel with us and have a prayer 
		before we shared our message.&nbsp; She refused to kneel.&nbsp; We felt 
		uncomfortable and a good spirit was not present.&nbsp; Following a brief 
		prayer I asked my stake president companion to read some verses in the 8<sup>th</sup> 
		chapter of 1<sup>st</sup> Nephi relating to Lehis dream and the 
		delicious fruit on the tree of life and how he was desirous that his 
		family partake of the fruit which was the word of God.&nbsp; Neither the 
		prayer nor the scripture caused any change in Sister Lockharts 
		countenance and attitude.&nbsp; We always taught our missionaries different 
		ways to invite the spirit.&nbsp; It is only the spirit that can teach and 
		touch ones heart.&nbsp; Everything else had failed.&nbsp; I opened the hymn book 
		and asked if she would join with us in singing I am a child of God.&nbsp; 
		She refused to sing with us.&nbsp; My companion and I sang a duet.&nbsp; Even 
		though I love the songs of Zion and sing them regularly while on the 
		tractor at the ranch, my wife can attest to the fact that singing is not 
		my long suit.&nbsp; Fortunately, my companion had a beautiful voice.&nbsp; There 
		was no change in Sister Lockharts countenance or facial expressions as 
		we sang the first two verses.&nbsp; However, as we were singing the words of 
		the chorus following the third verse; <i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside 
		me, help me find the way.&nbsp; Teach me all that I must do to live with Him 
		some day,</i> her eyes became moist and tears began to roll down her 
		cheeks.&nbsp; It was obvious that the spirit had touched her heart.&nbsp; She then 
		confessed that she had been away from the Church too long.&nbsp; She 
		committed to get her life in order and return to the fold.&nbsp; The stake 
		president followed through with the bishop and relief society president 
		to assure she had home and visiting teachers.&nbsp; The last I heard, Sister 
		Lockhart had returned to full activity in the church and was enjoying 
		all the blessings of the restored gospel.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I invite the Holy Ghost to be

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of my friends from the 
		Executive Office and I sat in the top row of Section&nbsp;C during the first 
		devotional of this semester when President and Sister Clark served as 
		the speakers.&nbsp; I had already received the invitation to serve as todays 
		speaker, so I paid close attention as you filed in that day and filled 
		this auditorium to near capacity.&nbsp; I was totally overwhelmed at the 
		thought of me standing here and was overcome with feelings of 
		inadequacy.&nbsp; I even shed a few tearsnot out of fear, but because I 
		sensed the responsibility that had been entrusted to me to provide a 
		message that would bless your lives and bring about worthwhile change.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Sitting up there in Section C 
		that day, my mind went back to when I was a student at Ricks College, to 
		the time when the Hart Building was the newest physical facility on 
		campus.&nbsp; That was a long time agotoo long ago for me to remember for 
		sure which day of the week devotional was held or whether it was in the 
		morning or the afternoon.&nbsp; But I remember coming to devotional.&nbsp; Week 
		after week, I sat right down there on the floor in a section of chairs 
		that was reserved for a service organization I belonged to.&nbsp; As 
		Valkyries, we were asked to dress in our service uniform on devotional 
		day and to sit as a group during the devotional hour.&nbsp; It was a great 
		time of camaraderie and sisterhood.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Back then I thought I knew 
		everything!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Hindsight, a lifetime of 
		living, and a bit of maturity tell me that perhaps I did not know quite 
		as much as I thought I did.&nbsp; Without question, there are things I know 
		now that I wish I had known then!&nbsp; Oh, to go back, to take a little 
		wisdom and insight with me.&nbsp; I would do some things differently, make 
		wiser choices, be a better person.&nbsp; For instance:</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">I wish I had known what a privilege it is to be a 
		student at this institution.&nbsp; I would have made better use of my time.&nbsp; 
		I would have studied more for the learning and less for the grades.&nbsp; I 
		would have attended devotional for the right reasons.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I wish I had known that 
		parents do not live forever.&nbsp; I would have been kinder to my father and 
		mother.&nbsp; I would have been more inclined to seek their counsel and heed 
		their advice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I wish I had known that this 
		life is not about me.&nbsp; I would have been a better friend to my 
		roommates, more tolerant of what appeared to me to be their quirks.&nbsp; I 
		would have thought less about what I wanted and more about the needs and 
		wants of others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some of you are probably 
		thinking:&nbsp; Sister Oldham, I am light years ahead of you.&nbsp; I already 
		know all that stuff.&nbsp; But there is a difference between knowing <i>
		about</i> something, knowing <i>of</i> it, and <i>knowing</i>.&nbsp; In other 
		words, it is possible to intellectually know something, without really 
		knowing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The dictionary defines 
		knowledge as an . . . acquaintance or familiarity with a fact . . . 
		that [which] has been perceived or grasped by the mind.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">1</font></span></span><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		But the knowledge I am talking about does not come from the mind, it 
		comes from the heart.&nbsp; It involves an additional layera layer the 
		scriptures refer to as understanding.&nbsp; Elder David A. Bednar taught that 
		understanding is built upon knowledge and that it comes as we use our 
		hearts and the process of revelation to obtain a confirming spiritual 
		witness concerning the truth of what we have come to know.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Today I want to talk about 
		four things that show up on my long list of things I wish I had known 
		when I was a student at Ricks Collegethings you may already know about 
		but perhaps may not fully understand, things I wish I had understood 
		when I was your age.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, I wish I had known 
		that how we serve in the Church is far more important than where we 
		serve, and that giving our best effort is far more important than status 
		or titles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As you probably know, Elder 
		Bednar served as president of BYUIdaho prior to being called to the 
		Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.&nbsp; Shortly after that change in assignment 
		was announced, Robert Wilkes was invited to serve as interim president 
		of the university until President Clark arrived the following August.&nbsp; 
		President Wilkes had previously served as a mission president and in key 
		administrative positions here at the university.&nbsp; One day while serving 
		as interim president, he received an email from one of his former 
		missionaries.&nbsp; It read, in part:</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">. . . Over the years, I have . . . wondered if you 
		[trusted] me . . . . As missionaries return, and they discuss the 
		accomplishments of their mission, I have noticed that many of the great 
		ones were zone leaders or assistants.&nbsp; It has always bothered me that I 
		was not [called to serve in these capacities]. . . . The reason that 
		these reflections come now [is] because I want to accurately portray my 
		missionary service to my children.&nbsp; I do not want to say that I was a 
		great missionary if I was not.&nbsp; I had success, but if it [came] despite 
		me then I had nothing to do with it and I have no claim to it.&nbsp; I just 
		need to know if I was a dependable tool in your tool beltperhaps a 
		hammer or a nail rather than a . . . specialized tool.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">I remember the heart-wrenching anguish I felt for 
		this young father as I read his email to President Wilkes.&nbsp; I sensed his 
		insecurity, his doubt, his desperate need to have his missionary service 
		validatedall because he had not carried the title of zone leader or 
		assistant.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">My mind went back to a time when I doubted my 
		self&#8209;worth and usefulness.&nbsp; I had been feeling a bit restless and 
		perhaps even a bit discontented with my church calling.&nbsp; For many years 
		I had served in various music positions.&nbsp; I loved these callings, and I 
		always tried to do my very best in them.&nbsp; Yet there came a point when I 
		began to feel as though I was in a rut, stuck on the very bottom rung of 
		the Church-calling ladder.&nbsp; Other women seemed to float in and out of 
		what appeared to me to be more important callingsserving first as 
		Primary president, then as Gospel Doctrine teacher, then as a counselor 
		in the Relief Society.&nbsp; I wondered what was wrong with me, what the flaw 
		was in my character that the bishop did not feel I was capable of doing 
		anything beyond music, why he felt I could not be trusted with more.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">Then something said one day in a sacrament meeting 
		caught my attention and humbled me to the core.&nbsp; The speaker, a 
		middle-aged gentleman, had not held any high-profile positions in the 
		ward for as long as I had known him.&nbsp; Yet he was steady and true.&nbsp; I 
		knew first-hand of his second-mile efforts as a home teacher, of his 
		behind-the-scenes work with the Scouting program, of his good heart.&nbsp; He 
		began his remarks that day with the phrase, How grateful I am for the 
		opportunity to serve . . . .&nbsp; I did not hear anything else he said.&nbsp; 
		The words how grateful I am kept ringing in my ears.&nbsp; I felt ashamed 
		of my attitude, ashamed for not having been grateful for the opportunity 
		to serve.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">This man was not worried about status or titles; 
		he was sincerely grateful to serve in whatever capacity he was called.&nbsp; 
		I think he understood what Alma meant when he said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">. . 
		. <i>why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have 
		been called</i>?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">I 
		know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. . . . yea

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font color="#000080">Each of us ought to 
		glory, to find joy in performing the work to which we have been called.&nbsp; 
		Yet there has been a long-standing tendency within the Church for us to 
		look beyond the mark.&nbsp; Clear back in 1842,</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">[Joseph Smith] . . . spoke of the disposition of 
		many men to consider the lower offices in the Church dishonorable, and 
		to look with jealous eyes upon the standing of others who are called to 
		preside over them; [he went on to teach] that it was the folly and 
		nonsense of the human heart for a person to be aspiring to other 
		stations than those to which they are appointed of God . . . to occupy; 
		[and] that . . . everyone should aspire only to magnify his own office 
		and calling.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">5</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If I were to ask you to tell 
		me about your favorite Book of Mormon hero, you might mention any one of 
		the predominant players such as Nephi, King Benjamin, or Moroni.&nbsp; Verses 
		in the book of Alma vividly describe some of these leaders.&nbsp; For 
		instance, we learn that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moroni was a strong and a mighty man . . 
		. a man of perfect understanding . . . a man who was firm in the faith 
		of Christ . . . .&nbsp; We also learn that . . . he was a man like unto 
		Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, 
		and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">6</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">Some of us are prone to want the rank and 
		position, the responsibility and visibility of a Moroni, an Ammon, or an 
		Alma!&nbsp; But those callings are not prerequisite to becoming a man or 
		woman of God.&nbsp; By simply serving faithfully, by being disciple-leaders 
		as taught by President Clark, it can be said of us as it was said of a 
		group of unnamed stalwarts in the Book of Mormona group who often go 
		unnoticed:</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">Now behold, Helaman and <i>his brethren</i> were

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">In March of 1832 Frederick G. Williams was called

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">That promised crown of immortality is extended

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">Let me tell you about two men who know how to

<font color="#000080">During a recent Relief Society lesson, the sisters 
		in my ward discussed a quote attributed to Hyrum Smith:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">Be 
		not discouraged, neither allow the spirit of doubt or gloom or 
		despondency to come into thy life, for these are tricks of the evil one 
		to destroy thy faith and thy usefulness.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">11</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As part of the lesson, the 
		sisters identified some of the things they find discouraging:&nbsp; the 
		ever-increasing price of gas and food, a broken dishwasher, health 
		challenges, failed marriages, wayward children.&nbsp; Had you participated in 
		the discussion, you may have added to the list such things as teachers 
		who expect too much or too little, roommates who are flippant about the 
		Honor Code, and the rejection you feel as weekend after weekend all your 
		friends seem to have dates and you sit home alone.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We read further from the 
		statement by Hyrum Smith:&nbsp; But look upon the bright side of life.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">12</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We shifted our thinking from 
		the negative to the positive and identified some of the things that make 
		up the bright side of life.&nbsp; Our list included such things as a 
		rainbow, the song of a bird, living prophets, having a temple in 
		Rexburg, husbands who honor their priesthood, children who walk in truth 
		and righteousness, grandchildren.&nbsp; Had you participated in the 
		discussion, you may have added things to the list that pertain to your 
		enrollment at BYUIdaho:&nbsp; a track system that allows many more of you to 
		be here; the faithful tithe payers of the Church who help make your 
		tuition affordable; and an Honor Code that, when adhered to, allows the 
		Holy Ghost to minister on this campus.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We read from the twenty-sixth 
		chapter of the book of Alma, likening the scriptures to ourselves, 
		adapting the words of Ammon to fit our circumstance:</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><font color="#000080">. . . how great 
			reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we 
			started [on this mortal journey] that God would have granted unto us 
			such great blessings? . . . have we not reason to rejoice?&nbsp; Yea, I 
			say unto you, there never were [women] that had so great reason to 
			rejoice as we, since the world began . . . .</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">13</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That day in Relief Society we 
		decided that we truly do have great reason to rejoice!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The group went on to unpack 
		the rest of the statement by Hyrum Smith.&nbsp; It teaches us how to move 
		from the negative to the positive and lays out some significant 
		blessings for doing so:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">. . 
		. be cheerful, humble, prayerful, and pure in thy devotion, and in thy 
		habits, and the Lord will remember thee in mercy.&nbsp; His power and 
		blessings will be upon thee.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Therefore, look unto the Lord in humility, and thou shalt be comforted 
		in the answers to thy prayers and be guided in the path of thy duty, day 
		and night.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">14</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">We decided that looking on the bright side of life 
		means to be optimistic; being cheerful means to be good natured and 
		happy; being humble means to be teachable and submissive; being 
		prayerful means acknowledging the Lord in all things, recognizing our 
		dependence on Him, and being grateful; being pure in our devotion means 
		being sincere and having no hypocrisy; being pure in our habits means 
		having integrity and being honest in all of our dealings; and that 
		looking to the Lord in humility means to trust Him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">We concluded that the process laid out by Hyrum 
		Smith provides a full&#8209;circle opportunity.&nbsp; Let me explain what I mean by 
		that.&nbsp; If we can develop and maintain an optimistic attitude, if we can 
		look upon the bright side of life on a consistent basis, the next five 
		elements will, in large measure, be natural byproducts of that 
		optimism.&nbsp; And then, as these elements become part of our fiber, part of 
		who we really are, it becomes much easier for us to look unto the Lord 
		in humility, to trust Him explicitly.&nbsp; And once we trust the Lord 
		explicitly, it is much easier to look upon the bright side of life on 
		a consistent basis.&nbsp; Together these elements become a helix that feeds 
		on itself and grows stronger and stronger as the cycle repeats itself 
		over and over.&nbsp; And once this helix becomes part of the very sinews of 
		our character, we then have the right to lay claim to and will recognize 
		in our lives the blessings identified by Hryum Smyth:&nbsp; first, the Lord 
		will remember [us] in mercy; second, His power and blessings will be 
		upon [us]; third, [we will] be comforted in the answers to [our] 
		prayers; and fourth, [we will] be guided in the path of [our] duty, day 
		and night.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">What marvelous promises!&nbsp; Truly, each of us has 
		great reason to focus on the positive, to be of good cheer,</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">15</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		to find joy in our journey.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">Third, I wish I had known that beyond loving <i>us</i>, 
		the Lord loves <i>me</i>, and that He is involved in the very details of
		<i>my</i> life, just as He is interested in and involved with your life 
		and the life of each of His children.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me tell you about a 
		former BYUIdaho student.&nbsp; I have lost track of this young woman and 
		could not contact her to ask permission to share her story, but I do not 
		think she will mind my doing so.&nbsp; For todays purposes I will call her 
		Molly, although that is not her real name.&nbsp; I read from my personal 
		writingsfirst, from a letter written to my son on October 20, 2002, and 
		then from a second letter written two months later on December 15:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">It 
		was my privilege this past week to randomly contact students and offer 
		them tickets to the dedication of the Gordon B. Hinckley Building.&nbsp; And 
		not just any tickets, but GOOD ticketslike <i>Chapel Center Section, 
		Row 1</i> or <i>Chapel Center Section, Row 2</i>.&nbsp; Do you know how close 
		these students will be to the Prophet?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">What 
		I came to realize as I visited with these students is that there was 
		inspiration in how they were identified and then selected to receive a 
		ticket.&nbsp; Certainly, the Lord is mindful of the tiniest sparrow.&nbsp; And He 
		is mindful of the average, low-key, back-row student at BYUIdaho who 
		would never have expected or thought himself or herself important enough 
		to be invited to a special gathering with the Prophet.&nbsp; I have been 
		touched by their surprise at being selected.&nbsp; Most of all, I have been 
		touched by their humility and gratitude for the opportunity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And from the second letter 
		written in December:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Molly was one of the students who received a ticket to the dedication of 
		the Hinckley Building.&nbsp; She called this week and asked if she could come 
		by the office to see me, which she did Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; I 
		immediately sensed that she wasnt comfortable visiting with me in the 
		outer office, so I suggested we go into the conference room.&nbsp; I closed 
		the door, we sat down, and then she began her story.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Molly said she had been dating a young man from her hometown who is not 
		a member of the Church.&nbsp; Just prior to the dedication, he had asked her 
		to marry him and she had accepted his proposal.&nbsp; She said she had not 
		planned to go to the dedication as she had hardened her heart to counsel 
		because she was tired of being told her decision was wrong.&nbsp; She wasnt 
		anxious or willing to go where she might have to once again sort through 
		her feelings and justify to herself or others what she was planning to 
		do.&nbsp; And then, out of the blue, she gets a call from me inviting her to 
		have a front-row seat at a meeting where President Hinckley and 
		President Monson are the featured speakers.&nbsp; She said she reluctantly 
		came to the office, picked up her ticket, and almost begrudgingly went 
		to the dedication.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">
		Molly got all teary eyed and said to me, Being there changed my life.&nbsp; 
		Something President Hinckley said, something I felt that day softened my 
		heart.&nbsp; I could see that I had been praying for the wrong things.&nbsp; I 
		could see that I was placing myself and my posterity for generations to 
		come in jeopardy of receiving eternal blessings.&nbsp; It has not been easy 
		and it did not happen overnight, but I have broken off my engagement.&nbsp; 
		Your offering me that ticket was the answer to my parents prayers.&nbsp; 
		Thank you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">All 
		I could do was sit there and cry right along with Molly.&nbsp; I tried to 
		help her understand that any thanks she had to express should be 
		directed to Someone other than me.&nbsp; I was merely the vehicle through 
		which invitations were extended.&nbsp; Truly, in each and every case, I felt 
		prompted and guided as I decided which students to contact.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I continue to read from the 
		second letter:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">And now, as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the 
		story:&nbsp; Molly is not a full-time student this semester.&nbsp; She stayed in 
		Rexburg during her off-track time to work and pick up a few night 
		classes.&nbsp; She should not have been on any list that was submitted to our 
		office for the dedication.&nbsp; But her name was there, it caught my 
		attention, and her life has been forever blessed.&nbsp; You cant tell me 
		that the Lord was not mindful of Molly and her precarious situation; of 
		her parents prayers and concern; of her heart, which He knew could be 
		touched.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, that 
		level of involvement is not held in reserve only for other people.&nbsp; Just 
		as the Lord was there for Molly, He is there for you and for me.&nbsp; He 
		knows our needs, our desires, our circumstances, and our challenges.&nbsp; He 
		stands ready to succor us, to strengthen us.&nbsp; His promise is sure and is 
		extended to each of usindividually, personally:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">. . 
		. for I will go before <i>your</i> face.&nbsp; I will be on <i>your</i> right 
		hand and on <i>your</i> left, and my Spirit shall be in <i>your</i> 
		[heart], and mine angels round about <i>you</i>, to bear <i>you </i>up.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">16</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It takes faith and effort and 
		a bit of practice to see the hand of the Lord in our individual lives.&nbsp; 
		We can begin cultivating that ability by taking time each day to ponder 
		the following questions suggested by President Eyring last October in 
		general conference:&nbsp; Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch 
		[me] or [my] children or [my] family today? . . . Did God send a message 
		that was just for me?&nbsp; Did I see His hand in my life . . .?</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">17</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I promise that as you 
		consistently reflect upon these questions, evidence will come that the 
		Lord loves youindividually, personallyand that He is involved in the 
		very details of your life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Fourth, I wish I had known 
		that the way we serve, the attitude with which we approach everything we 
		do, and our ability to acknowledge the Lords hand in our lives are a 
		reflection of our faith in and understanding of the grace and mercy 
		extended to us through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I recall a conversation I had 
		with Elder Bednar one day when he served as president of BYUIdaho.&nbsp; As 
		a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy, he had been on a stake 
		conference assignment the weekend before.&nbsp; He commented to me that if he 
		were to be assigned one, and only one, point of doctrine to talk about 
		for the remainder of his life, he would want it to be the enabling power 
		of the Atonement.&nbsp; He said, I dont think the membership of the Church 
		understands the enabling power very well.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To be honest with you, I was 
		not sure what he was talking about.&nbsp; I had never before heard the phrase
		<i>enabling power </i>linked to the word <i>atonement</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I knew 
		about the redeeming power of the Atonement.&nbsp; Even as a little girl I had 
		been taught and I believed that Christ voluntarily laid down His life 
		and took it up again so all of us would be resurrected.&nbsp; And I had been 
		taught and believed that He suffered in Gethsemane and on the cross at 
		Calvary, taking upon Himself the sins of the world, so that we, through 
		repentance, could go back into the presence of the Father.&nbsp; Mistakenly, 
		I thought the Atonement was only for later, that it had nothing to do 
		with the here and now.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I did not know about nor did 
		I understand an additional dimension of the Atonement, an enabling power 
		that provides us, as described in the Bible Dictionary, with the 
		strength and assistance to do good works that [we] otherwise would not 
		be able to maintain if left to [our] own means.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">18</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, this 
		enabling power comes to fruition, it becomes evident, as we, among other 
		things, serve faithfully, look forward with optimism, and acknowledge 
		the Lords hand in our lives.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please travel back with me to 
		the evening before the announcement was made that Ricks College would 
		become Brigham Young University-Idaho.&nbsp; Earlier that afternoon, 
		President Bednar was informed that President Hinckley planned to 
		announce the change the next morning at a press conference in Salt Lake 
		City.&nbsp; There was not much time to pull loose ends together, and members 
		of the Presidents Council and a few other administrators were at the 
		office late that night making last-minute preparations.&nbsp; It was close to 
		11:30 when things were finally wrapping up and winding down.&nbsp; I was at 
		the copy machine; President Bednar was leaving the building.&nbsp; I said to 
		him, President, does any of this scare you?&nbsp; Do you feel a bit sick to 
		your stomach?&nbsp; I will never forget his response.&nbsp; Without even a hint 
		of a hesitation, he said:&nbsp; If I thought I had to do this by myself, I 
		would be scared to death.&nbsp; But I know who is in charge.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">19</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
<font color="#000080">My good young friends, I, too, have come to know 
		who is in charge.&nbsp; Over the past eight years as we have transitioned 
		from Ricks College to BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho, I 
		have watched a miracle unfold on this campus.&nbsp; No, not a miracle, but an 
		ongoing succession of miracles.&nbsp; Most of them have come quietly, 
		insignificantly when considered on their own merits.&nbsp; But combined, when 
		viewed as an aggregate, they provide evidence beyond doubt that Someone 
		who sees all and knows all is aware of and involved with the very 
		details of everything that happens at BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho 
		and in our individual lives.&nbsp; They provide evidence of an enabling power 
		that helps us accomplish things that in and of ourselves we could never 
		accomplish.&nbsp; They provide evidence that, beyond later, the Atonement is 
		for here and now.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Yes, I know who is in 
		charge!&nbsp; I need Him to be in charge!&nbsp; I invite Him to be in charge!&nbsp; I 
		cannot do it on my ownnot now, and not later.&nbsp; And neither can you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It does not matter what 
		positions we hold in the Church.&nbsp; As long as we do them well, if we give 
		our best effort, we are covered by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ 
		and that service becomes acceptable to the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It does not matter what

		we are covered by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ and we become 
		sanctified and acceptable to the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This life is all about coming 
		to know the Savior.&nbsp; It is about inviting Him into our lives, about 
		letting Him be in charge of the very details such that we become all 
		that He wants us to be, all that He needs us to be, all that He knows we 
		can be.&nbsp; It is all about coming to know and being able to say, 
		individually and personally, The Atonement is for <i>me.</i>&nbsp; Oh, how 
		I wish I had known that when I was your age!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">May each of you come to know

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">I

		seamen who used their light to guide them safely through the rocky 
		shoals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">I 
		have learned that when seas were particularly bad or visibility 
		extremely poor, the lighthouse keeper would ask those living along the 
		coast to put lanterns in their windows, thus adding definition to the 
		shoreline during the most dangerous times. These lights were referred to 
		as the lower lights. They too are credited with keeping many ships from 
		peril. These lower lights inspired the hymn: &quot;Brightly Beams Our 
		Fathers Mercy.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		This famous hymn was written by Philip Bliss over a century ago. He was 
		inspired during a sermon by the famous preacher D.L. Moody while living 
		in Chicago. In that sermon, the preacher talked about a ship that was 
		trying to find Cleveland harbor in the midst of a terrible storm at 
		night. The waves were large, the night sky without a star.&nbsp; The captain 
		strained his eyes in the darkness yearning to find a signal of light by 
		which to guide the ship.</span></p>

<p class="citation"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #000080">The 
		Apostle Paul warned that in the times which we now live, <i>Men shall 
		be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, 
		disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  lovers of pleasures more 
		than lovers of God.</i></span><i><span style="color: #000080"><sup><font size="2">7</font></sup></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		With Satan and his followers being relentless in their goal to win the 
		hearts of the children, there is no greater place where love is 
		essential than in our own homes.&nbsp; Love is the essence of protecting our 
		families. Our homes should be a haven of love. The character of a 
		righteous family exists through love, courtesy, respect, and placing 
		other family members needs ahead of our own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">I 
		wish to speak for just a moment to current and future mothers and 
		fathers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">In 
		The Family: A proclamation to the world, we learn many important things 
		about protecting our families through serving them.</span></p>
<p><i>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each 
		other and for their children. Children are an heritage of the Lord 
		(Psalms 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in 
		love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual 
		needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the 
		commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live.<sup>8</sup>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Sisters, please own this obligation to serve and teach.&nbsp; Many future 
		generations depend on you to teach correct principles as you nurture 
		your children.</span></p>
<p><i>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">By 
		divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Brethren, I hope you take this responsibility seriously.&nbsp; Far too many 
		fathers in the world are choosing to live a life of self-centered 
		ambition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Brethren, never, ever find yourselves deserving the chastisement of the 
		Lord as recorded in the book of Jacob, <i>Ye have broken the hearts of 
		your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of 
		your bad examples before them; and the sobbing of their hearts ascend up 
		to God against you<sup><font size="2">9</font></sup> .</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">A 
		very sad and piercing description of what not to be. Brethren, let us 
		commit to serve our families and put their needs above our own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Again quoting from the family proclamation. </span></p>
<p><i>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded 
		upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and 
		families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, 
		repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome 
		recreational activities.<sup><font size="1">8</font></sup></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">If 
		we look to the scriptures, there are many great examples of how to serve 
		in our families:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		Father Lehi frequently bore testimony to his family, Nephi taught us to 
		provide for our families, and Alma the elder prayed for his wayward son:
		<i>Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of  thy father; for he has 
		prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to 
		the knowledge of the truth.<sup><font size="1">10</font></sup></i> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">As 
		we learn, teach, pray and serve together as families we will be united 
		in a common goal which will richly bless many generations to come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">In 
		the popular musical My Fair Lady, the flower girl, Eliza Doolittle,

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		One of the most famous questions of all time was asked anciently by 
		Adams son Cain after he murdered his brother Abel.&nbsp; In response to the 
		Lord questioning the whereabouts of Abel, Cain replied, <i>Am I my 
		brothers keeper?<sup><font size="1">18</font></sup> </i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">An 
		interesting question and one that we all should consider. Are we our 
		brothers keepers?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">
		One answer to this question comes from the teachings of Alma:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">&nbsp;<i> 
		and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be 
		called his people, and are willing to bear one anothers burdens, that 
		they may be light; Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; 
		yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort.<sup><font size="1">19</font></sup> &nbsp;</i>Are 
		we our brothers keeper?&nbsp; Are we our neighbors keeper? The answer for 
		all those who wish to come into the fold of God is a resounding YES.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">It 
		is not requisite, however, that we form a complicated plan to serve our 
		neighbors.&nbsp; The service that is most needed occurs one-on-one in the 
		basic daily interactions we have within our families, our neighborhoods, 
		our wards and our communities. It is the simple sharing of ourselves 
		with those we know and those we dont know who surround us every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">We 
		have all had the experience of being guided and lifted up by good men 
		and women.&nbsp; In one way or another we all rely on each other as fellow 
		saints to make it to our eternal goal.&nbsp; Let us find simple ways that we

		Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, of the Quorum of the Twelve, had stood to give

		The poignant moment came when we witnessed the love of an apostle for

		vital to intervene. The obvious outcome of this intervention would have 
		been to help Elder Wirthlin off the stand where he could get the medical 
		attention he needed. But this is not what Elder Nelson did.<br />
<br />
		Elder Nelson shored up his friend. Gently he took Elder Wirthlin by the 
		arm and held on to the back of his belt. He stayed by his side through 
		the remainder of the talk. A message delivered, a duty fulfilled, Elder 
		Nelson helped Elder Wirthlin to his seat.&nbsp; What an example, what

		missing father and husband as they witnessed other families worshipping 
		together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000080">In

		few weeks later his young son Max was asked to give a talk in sacrament 
		meeting.&nbsp; He pleaded with his father to attend the service to hear his 
		talk.&nbsp; With much trepidation Walt decided to go.&nbsp; Sitting through the 
		sacrament meeting it was finally time for Max to give his talk.&nbsp; He 
		stepped to the podium and proceeded to give a wonderful address about 
		the importance of accepting callings in the church and said that if the 
		Bishop called you to serve you were to accept it every time. That even 
		if someone were called to be the Explorer Scouts Leader they should

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is an honor for me to be 
		invited to share a few introductory remarks with you graduates at this 
		commencement.&nbsp; I am here on behalf of the Commissioner, Elder Kerr, and 
		bring his love and greetings to you all.&nbsp; Since he will be completing 
		his assignment as Commissioner on August 1, he would have liked to have 
		been here this afternoon to participate in the last commencement prior 
		to the end of his service.&nbsp; However, most of you would know he has been 
		called as the new temple president of the Logan Temple and he is busily 
		preparing for that assignment; therefore, he asked that I come and 
		represent him here today.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Graduation is a time when you 
		receive lots of advice and guidance for your future.&nbsp; Some comes from 
		parents, friends, spouses, and even from commencement speakers.&nbsp; Some of 
		that counsel will be good; some will soon be forgotten.&nbsp; As I have 
		reflected on what I could share with you today, I have been impressed by 
		the Spirit to share some thoughts that are as much for me as they are 
		for you.&nbsp; I hope that from time to time you may have occasion to 
		remember a little of what I will share with you, and hopefully it may 
		make a difference in your life or in the lives of those you will touch.&nbsp; 
		I would like to address briefly the importance of using what you have 
		gained while obtaining an education in learning to ask questions.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the evidences of an 
		education is the ability to think.&nbsp; Another is the ability to ask 
		appropriate questions.&nbsp; Asking thoughtful questions of those who are 
		uniquely qualified to share their insights and inspiration with you can 
		be an enriching blessing as you continue to learn throughout your life.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are many great 
		questions to ponder.&nbsp; Some interesting ones come from listening to 
		little children, such as:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 39.0pt">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 39.0pt">

		</font></span>Will kissing kill you? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we get older and learn 
		more, we tend to ask deeper, more probing questions  both 
		intellectually and spiritually.&nbsp; We all enjoy the blessings of the 
		restoration, priesthood ordinances, the Book of Mormon, and the 
		revelations found in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants all because Joseph 
		asked. &nbsp;A carefully considered question can open our minds and our 
		hearts to new vistas of understanding and deeper spiritual insights.&nbsp; 
		The more questions we ask, the more we will learn; the more we learn, 
		the more questions we will have until eventually we will come to know 
		the truth of all things, which is defined in the revelations as a 
		knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to 
		come (D&amp;C 93:24).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Before my father died, he 
		once lamented that one of the challenges with getting older was when you 
		finally were old enough to know all the answers, people stopped asking 
		you the questions.&nbsp; Although my children may argue to the contrary, I 
		know I am not old.&nbsp; And the reason I know I am not old is because, by my 
		fathers standard at least, not only do I not know all the answers I am 
		still learning the questions.&nbsp; Great insight and wisdom can be gained by 
		asking questions of those who have a wealth of knowledge based on their 
		academic achievements and through lifes experiences.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another evidence of an 
		educated mind is to find interest in learning about others  what they 
		do and what they know  and being able to bring out the best in them.&nbsp; 
		One of my favorite stories contrasting being self-absorbed versus 
		bringing out the best in others comes from the history of Victorian 
		England.&nbsp; Two of the most noted British politicians and statesmen of the 
		nineteenth century were Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone.&nbsp; They 
		were political rivals and both served in the British Parliament most of 
		their adult lives, Disraeli for 44 years and Gladstone for 62 years.&nbsp; 
		They alternated serving as Prime Minister (Disraeli twice and Gladstone 
		four times) several times during their careers depending on which of the 
		two political parties was in power.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While attending a number of 
		formal banquets, Lady Jennie Churchill, the mother of Sir Winston 
		Churchill, was privileged to sit next to each of these leaders.&nbsp; Later 
		she was asked by a friend what she had learned from these great men.&nbsp; 
		She replied, When I left the dining room after sitting next to 
		Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England, but when I sat 
		next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman 
		(Hibbert, 2006, p. 336).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A great example of the 
		consummate learner, one interested in others and learning from others, 
		was President Eyrings father.&nbsp; Professor Henry Eyring was one of the 
		worlds most notable and respected chemists of his day.&nbsp; During his 
		career he received every honor and award, both nationally and 
		internationally, available in the field of chemistry with the exception 
		of the Nobel Prize, and some believed he should have received it as 
		well.&nbsp; Even with all of his education and experience, Brother Eyring was 
		always seeking to learn from other people, regardless of their station 
		in life.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One example comes from an 
		event shared by President Eyring.&nbsp; One afternoon on his way home from 
		the university, Professor Eyring stopped at a service station to get gas 
		for his car.&nbsp; (For those who do not know what a service station is: once 
		upon a time when you stopped for gas, a person actually came out and 
		filled your tank, checked your oil, washed your windshield, and 
		processed your payment  all with a smile on his face.)&nbsp; While he was 
		waiting for the service to be completed, Professor Eyring got out of his 
		car and struck up a conversation with the young attendant.&nbsp; When he got 
		back in the car, his son, Henry, asked why he had spent time talking to 
		a gas station attendant.&nbsp; Brother Eyring wisely and correctly noted, 
		Look, I can learn something from anybody. Everyone has had experiences 
		I havent had (Eyring, 1997, p. 24).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Engaging a person in a 
		conversation which allows them to open up and share what they have 
		learned in life is a great social skill that will benefit you 
		tremendously.&nbsp; Some are more gifted at it than others, but we are 
		counseled to seekearnestly the best gifts (D&amp;C 46:8).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One more example of that was 
		demonstrated in a meeting with Elder David B. Haight.&nbsp; He was assigned 
		to our stake conference several years ago, which was an unforgettable 
		experience.&nbsp; In addition to the tremendous spiritual counsel, guidance, 
		and wisdom that he shared as a special witness of the Savior, I was very 
		impressed watching him at a dinner we had between our Saturday 
		meetings.&nbsp; He would engage one person in a conversation about his work, 
		family, interests, etc. and then ask insightful and knowledgeable 
		questions about whatever topic was being discussed to try to understand 
		that person more deeply.&nbsp; Then he would engage another person the same 
		way and head off into an entirely different direction with the same 
		depth of insight and questions about the new topic.&nbsp; His breadth of 
		knowledge, education, and experience were remarkable and he demonstrated 
		it not by telling what he knew, but by asking questions and allowing 
		others to share their knowledge and learn from an apostle in the 
		process.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Hinckley also was a 
		man of tremendous spiritual and intellectual capacity.&nbsp; His knowledge 
		was vast and his curiosity was keen.&nbsp; He was always asking questions.&nbsp; 
		At one point in my career when I started meeting with the First 
		Presidency on a regular basis on business-related matters, I was 
		counseled by a colleague always to be prepared.&nbsp; He observed that 
		President Hinckley would always be asking questions and his questions 
		had one of three objectives: (1) his natural curiosity drove him to want 
		to learn what he could from each person he would meet with, (2) he would 
		want to know whether you knew about your area of responsibility and knew 
		what you were doing so he wouldnt have to worry about that aspect of 
		the work, and (3) he would use the questioning process to teach a 
		principle to someone else in the meeting.&nbsp; I always had to be prepared, 
		because I was never sure which of the three, or perhaps all three 
		concurrently, were going on.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I can assure you that the 
		current First Presidency is equally blessed with a natural curiosity and 
		tremendous spiritual and intellectual capacity.&nbsp; It is a great blessing 
		to be able to work with them and try to anticipate the kinds of 
		questions they might ask as we prepare to share issues related to all 
		aspects of the Church Educational System, including BYU-Idaho, with 
		them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You have learned a lot while 
		being a student and are now anxious to go out and apply your knowledge 
		and impress those who offered you a job and who are willing to pay you 
		for what you have learned.&nbsp; However, rather than just trying to impress 
		others by telling them how much you know, dont forget to be observant 
		and to ask questions of those who have greater experience, then listen 
		for wise counsel and be discerning about what you might be able to apply 
		in your life.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ask, and it shall be given 
		unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto 
		you (3 Nephi 14:7).&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

		learning require a special code of conduct from their members. In this 
		permissive world we are blessed that the institutions of learning of The 
		Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still require a code of 
		conduct. Your willingness to live the honor code has been certified 
		every year by your bishop. I would like to talk today about the 
		importance of continuing to live the Lords honor code in the years to 
		come.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is important to remember 
		why the Lord has given us a code of conduct. We each received our first 
		lessons about the plan of happiness in the world of spirits before we 
		were born.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">1</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		We each then fought in a great conflict to be participants in that plan. 
		Hopefully we are each seeking the blessings that come from living that 
		plan. We know that if we successfully navigate this life, we have the 
		promise of eternal life, and in order to be successful, we must live by 
		the Lords code of conduct. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord told Abraham, 
		Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon

		earth.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">3</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Then the Lord said, And we will prove them (that means all the people 
		who would come to earth) therewith, to see if they will do all things 
		whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; And they who keep 
		their first estate (the life we had before this one) shall be added 
		upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in 
		the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who 
		keep their second estate (the life we are living now) shall have glory

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Additionally, we know that we 
		are living in the last days which are described very well in Matthew 24. 
		And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: for nation shall rise 
		against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 2 Timothy, the apostle

		selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, 
		unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false 
		accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Graduates, that describes the 
		world you are entering. However, you do not need to worry. The apostle 
		Paul said, But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,

		thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code of conduct you have lived at this university has been 
		good preparation for you to navigate in the world outside of this 
		university.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The honor code you committed 
		to live by at BYUIdaho has included a commitment to honesty, chastity, 
		clean language, respect for others, not partaking of addictive 
		substances, appropriate dress and grooming, and attendance at Church 
		meetings. As you leave this university, you will no longer have the BYUIdaho 
		honor code to protect you but you should continue to follow the Lords 
		code of conduct. Much of the Lords code of conduct can be found in <i>
		For the Strength of Youth</i> and I would recommend this book as a 
		lifelong resource for you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On my personal copy of that 
		book, I have circled the word YOU, meaning <i>For the Strength of You</i>. 
		I would like to review some of the Lords code of conduct found in this 
		book. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Continuing to live the 
		standard of honesty after you leave BYUIdaho will be a blessing to you.
		<i>For the Strength of Youth </i>teaches that dishonesty hurts you and 
		usually hurts others as well.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">8</font></span></span><font color="#000080">

		for your pay.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">9</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		As you live that principle you will be more likely to progress in your 
		careers. Being honest requires courage and commitment but you will be 
		able to do so because you have practiced living that principle here.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At BYUIdaho you made a 
		commitment to obey the law of chastity. You know that God has commanded 
		that sexual intimacy be reserved for marriage. In <i>For the Strength of 
		Youth</i> we read that when you are chaste, you protect yourself from 
		the emotional damage that always comes from sharing physical intimacies 
		with someone outside of marriage.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">10</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Living that principle throughout your life, will bless and protect you.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the BYUIdaho honor code 
		you committed to use clean language. <i>For the Strength of Youth </i>
		teaches that how you speak says much about who you are. Use language 
		that uplifts, encourages, and compliments others. Do not insult others 
		or put them down, even in joking.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">11</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		You will be more successful in your lives and you can help others 
		around you to use clean language by your example and by good-naturedly 
		encouraging them to choose other words.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">12</font></span></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At BYUIdaho you also 
		committed to abstain from all substance abuse including alcoholic 
		beverages, tobacco, tea, and coffee. I would also include in that the 
		admonition of the prophets to remain free from participation in and 
		addiction to pornography. <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> teaches that 
		you must remain free from harmful addictions that have control over your 
		life. When you do this, you gain the blessings of a healthy body, an 
		alert mind, and the guidance of the Holy Ghost.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">13</font></span></span><font color="#000080">

		the guidance of the Holy Ghost? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You committed to participate 
		regularly in Church services. Now you are going out on your own, you 
		will not be part of well organized student wards. I am sure you wont 
		forget that the Lord has given the Sabbath day for your benefit. <i>For 
		the Strength of Youth</i> teaches that when seeking a job, share with 
		your potential employer your desire to attend your Sunday meetings and 
		keep the Sabbath day holy. Many employers value employees with these 
		personal convictions. Whenever possible, choose a job that does not 
		require you to work on Sundays.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">14</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		Remember, as you begin to prosper and move ahead in your lives, that 
		Sunday is not a holiday or a day for recreation or other athletic 
		events.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">15</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		You will stand out and impress others by your willingness to continue 
		living this principle the Lord has given you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At BYUIdaho you committed to 
		observe dress and grooming standards. Most of you understand that your 
		body is Gods sacred creation and you shouldnt defile it in any way. <i>
		For the Strength of Youth </i>teaches that the way you dress is a 
		reflection of what you are on the inside. Your dress and grooming sends 
		messages about you to others and influences the way you and others act. 
		When you are well groomed and modestly dressed, you invite the 
		companionship of the Spirit and can exercise a good influence on those 
		around you.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">16</font></span></span><font color="#000080">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You have also been counseled 
		not to disfigure yourself with tattoos or body piercings and to show 
		respect by dressing appropriately for all activities. Living those 
		principles as you go forward in your life, will invite continual 
		blessings. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Living other principles 
		taught in <i>For the Strength of Youth </i>which are not included in the 
		honor code will also bless you. Consider the principle of education. In 
		your homes and families, establish an environment of learning. 
		Education is an investment that brings great rewards.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">17</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		It is a lifelong principle. You live in a competitive world where a 
		good education opens the doors of opportunity that may otherwise be 
		closed to you.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">18</font></span></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>For the Strength of Youth
		</i>also teaches the principle of gratitude. If you live with a spirit 
		of thanksgiving, you will have greater happiness and satisfaction in 
		life</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">19</font></span></span><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The principle of friends is 
		taught in <i>For the Strength of Youth</i>. You are counseled to choose 
		your friends carefully. They will greatly influence how you think and 
		act, and even determine the person you will become. A true friend will 
		encourage you to be your best self. To have good friends, be a good 
		friend yourself. Show interest in others and treat them with kindness 
		and respect. Go out of your way to be a friend to those who are shy or 
		do not feel included. Invite your friends of other faiths to your Church 
		meetings and activities, where they can learn about the gospel. Many 
		people have joined the Church through the example and fellowship of 
		their friends.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">21</font></span></span><font color="#000080">

		the friends you choose in the years to come. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember family. You fought a 
		great pre-earth conflict for the privilege of having a family. Satan 
		will discourage and distract you from living correct principles 
		regarding family because he can never have a family. Being part of a 
		family is a great blessing. <i>For the Strength of Youth </i>teaches 
		that not all families are the same but every family is important. You 
		can strengthen your relationships with brothers and sisters and with 
		parents.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">22</font></span></span><font color="#000080">
</font><span style="color: #000080">As I have traveled in the world I

		and you will be following the Lords code of conduct regarding family.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>For the Strength of Youth
		</i>reminds you to pay your tithes and offerings. The law of tithing is 
		an important commandment that you should obey throughout your life.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"><font color="#000080" size="1">23</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As you live the principle of

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By living the standards in <i>
		For the Strength of Youth</i>, you will be following the Lords code of

		Church in all circumstances. As you live the Lords code of conduct, you 
		are promised that the Lord will make much more out of your life than 
		you can by yourself. He will increase your opportunities, expand your

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Graduates, you have been 
		blessed to live in the environment of BYUIdaho and you have been 
		protected by the honor code. Now you will go out into the world. Some of 
		you may become discouraged, some of you may be tempted to give up on the 
		Lords plan, and some of you may relax your standards because you are no 
		longer committed to live the honor code; but if you continue to live the 
		Lords code of conduct, you will be blessed. You will no longer need an 
		annual bishops endorsement but you can look forward to interviews with 
		a priesthood leader to renew temple recommends which certify your 
		willingness to live the Lords code of conduct.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the Book of Mormon, the

In the last little while I have had a number of thoughts about what I should speak about today. And as I have prayed about it, I&#39;ve decided to speak a little bit about something that is very near and dear to my heart. And I hope that you will pray for me that the Holy Ghost will come, that we will be able to learn together and that what is said in the next few minutes will be helpful to you. 
</p>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Back in about 1931, then-Ricks College entered a very treacherous period of time. I it was the Great Depression, the Church was under severe financial pressure. The local authorities here at the time were informed that the Church would no longer be able to support the college in the same way. Although the support did not end, it was very small. There was a local board at that time, much like we have now in stakes and in the Church where we have a Board of Education that watches over the seminary programs and the institute programs and the stakes. That local board ran the school for a few years. It was very difficult. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The people who worked at the school at that time, the college, were small in number. There were probably at that time maybe 200 students. Everybody struggled. Back in the records you can see evidence that students who came often did not have enough money to pay tuition and so issued the university IOUs. We don&#39;t do that anymore. Also, apparently tuition was paid in kind sometimes. There were pay cuts, significant pay cuts for everybody. It was a very, very challenging time. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But the good souls who were here at that time believed so much in the school that they kept it going, amazingly for a number of years. And by the end of the 30s, the Church had come back and taken over responsibility again. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Also during that time, if you recall, if you have read that history, the Church decided to give all its junior colleges to the states in which they were located. That was true of Ricks College as well. But the state of Idaho wouldn&#39;t take it. It went to the legislature many times. The local legislators around here worked hard to present to the Senate, the House, and the State the prospect of simply receiving the college. But the State refused to accept it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And so, it was kind of a little bit of an orphan. The Church had said, &quot;We can&#39;t support it.&quot; And the State said, &quot;We don&#39;t want it.&quot; It was the local folks who kept it going. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As I have thought about them, those people, I have wondered what they thought about the future of the college in the 1930s. When they looked ahead in their imaginations, what did they imagine? I don&#39;t think they saw BYU-Idaho and what it is today. I don&#39;t think they saw that. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
One of the best indicators we have of vision in that time was [Hyrum] Manwaring who was president at the time. Many, many years later in 1954, he wrote a vision of Ricks College which went out about 60 years. He wrote it in 1954 and took it all the way out to 2014. But his vision of 2014 was realized in the 1980s. He did see expansion of the college and its growth. One aspect he got wrong. He envisioned a golf course on the south hill; and he waxed eloquent. In fact if you read his words, you would think he was inspired. But he was only inspired by his love of golf, because today on the south hill there is a temple of the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think the people in the 1930s saw that. I don&#39;t think they imagined that the day would come that there would be thousands and thousands of young people coming to school here and that this would be a great university. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now the thought that occurred to me was this: we stand in the same relationship to our future as those people in the 1930s stood to theirs. We can see ahead somewhat that there are great things that the Lord has in store. I think we see them just about as well as the people in the 1930s saw their future. There is much that is coming - much that the Lord has in mind for this place. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Prophets have stood on this campus and have announced prophecies about BYU-Idaho. I want to read a couple of them to you. Just to capture the power that is in the future and the power that is here now. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 2001 President Eyring was here and gave that marvelous address we had you read about: &quot;The Steady, Upward Course.&quot; In it he said this:&quot; Students...&quot; We&#39;ve talked about this already today. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Students will learn from example how to keep on a steady upward course in times of great change. They will see leaders and teachers and staff members for whom the Savior and His kingdom are at the center of their lives. From that example I make a prophecy.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
And then he looked up and said, 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Now listen carefully. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	From that example, they - you - will become life-long teachers in their families, in the Church, and in their work. They will bless others wherever they go by what they have learned about innovating with scare resources and treating all they have as if it were the Lord&#39;s. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	You can imagine the joy of an employer or a Church leader when such a graduate arrives. The graduates will be at personal peace by having kept the commandments. They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. They will have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more of what money can buy. Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become - and this is a prophecy...,&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
he said. If you&#39;ve seen the video of that, you will see he raised his head up and looked at the audience. And I&#39;m sure some of you were there. And he said, 
</p>
<p>
	...this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly-those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve. (Eyring, Steady Upward Course, BYU-Idaho Devotional, Sept. 18, 2001) 
	</p>
<p>
In 2005 Elder Bednar was here for my inauguration. At the luncheon he said this, something he said many times: 
</p>
<p>
	Now as I conclude I repeat a comment that I have made before. I hope you will remember this statement. The creation of BYU-Idaho was one of the most important educational events of the restoration. The lessons that are being learned and will be learned on this campus will influence many members and non-members the world over. The innovations that are initiated on this campus will bless the students and the faculty who attend here, and, over time, will have an impact in many areas of the world. I know that the Lord Jesus Christ is aware of, attentive to, and involved in the things that are taking place on this campus. I so testify and express my love to you. (Bednar, BYU-Idaho Inaugural Luncheon, October 11, 2005) 
	</p>
<p>
These prophecies and many more that I could cite chart for us a remarkable future. As I have thought about that future, it has become very clear that we indeed continue to build on a strong foundation. But we ourselves are laying the foundation for what lies ahead. Because of that, because of that pattern that we see in the history of this place, change - inspired progressive - is a way of life here. It is inherent in the very nature of this institution. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We are becoming good at changing. There is so much of it around us, and we are becoming good at it. In most universities, at least the ones that I am aware of, things change, but they change slowly. Here, things happen fast. It is because of the work the Lord has for us to do. And so change is such an important part of what we do. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In our history and in the emphasis on change that we experience in our lives here, we follow a pattern that is in the kingdom of God. I would just like to share that pattern with you today briefly. 
</p>
<p>
In Daniel, chapter 2, which I had you read, there is the marvelous prophecy about the stone cut out without hands. And in verse 34 of Daniel, chapter 2, this is what we read; this is now Daniel giving Nebuchadnezzar the interpretation of his dream: 
</p>
<p>
	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. (Daniel 2:34-35) 
	</p>
<p>
Sometimes when we read this scripture and refer to it, we talk about the stone cut out without hands rolling forth on the earth. That&#39;s also referred to in the Doctrine and Covenants, but here in Daniel is a phrase that I think is very meaningful and important to recognize. And it says, let me just reemphasis it: &quot;The stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In my mind as I have read that, I see this stone cut out without hands becoming a mountain, meaning it didn&#39;t just grow to become a big rock. It changed and transformed itself into a mountain so glorious and so powerful that it filled the whole earth. That&#39;s the kingdom of God. It is the kingdom that we live in; it is the kingdom of the restoration begun as a stone cut out without hands when the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and His Father, Eloheim, appeared to the Prophet Joseph in the Sacred Grove. That small event glorious and powerful became the stone, and the kingdom rolls forth. But it changes and develops as it grows, and as it becomes a great mountain. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We hear in the 82<sup>nd</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants that the same imagery of the kingdom changing and growing. In verse 14, for example, the Lord said: 
</p>
<p>
	For Zion must increase in beauty, and holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments. 
	</p>
<p>
And of course in the 65<sup>th</sup> section that I had you read, we hear the same tone and the same image. Verses 5 and 6: 
</p>
<p>
	Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants there may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, in which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven....&quot; 
	</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Do you see that word? &quot;...which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven&quot; (meaning He will bring heaven with Him). 
</p>
<p>
	...clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up upon the earth. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven and so on earth.... (D&amp;C 65:5-6) 
	</p>
<p>
And so we see in the scriptures this sense that the kingdom is to be perfected. It is to roll forth and to change and to grow and develop so that it may be ready to receive the Lord when He comes, because He will bring heaven with Him. And so the kingdom of God on the earth must become heavenly and ready to accept the Lord when He comes. And then, we know, also from other scriptures, that once the millennium is finished, there is a great work to be done in the millennium, because in the millennium the Lord, Himself, will perfect His kingdom and He will present it to His Father. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now that means that the growth and development of the kingdom has to occur in two ways: first, if you think about it, the institutions of the kingdom change. The institutions change. The practices, the processes, the organization, they change. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Think back to when you were a child. Some of you will recall the days of Junior Sunday School. Some of you recall going to Primary during the week and all sorts of things that are no more because they have changed the institute. The institution has changed. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There is a great example of institutional change taking place all around us in the kingdom, if we watch. I have been called to be a member of the 5<sup>th</sup> Quorum of the Seventy. I am serving as an Area Seventy, a responsibility that Elder Johnson once held as well. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Well long before the Quorums of the Seventy were organized the way they are now, there used to be hundreds of quorums of seventies. That has all been changed. Those are institutional changes.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But the kingdom has also changed in us. We must change. That is also important in the development of the kingdom because we are the kingdom, and we have to change. You can&#39;t read the scriptures and not come away with the realization that the Lord&#39;s plan is that each one of us will change. You recall the phrases that come to mind are many, but you recall that when [Saul] was anointed king of Israel, Samuel said to him, and the Lord will give unto you a new heart (I Samuel 10:9) and you will become a new man (I Samuel 10:6). We read in [Saul] all these images about the newness of life, and the new mind and new spirit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the Book of Mormon, throughout the Book of Mormon the echoes of us changing resonate all through that scripture. Probably the most famous is in Mosiah 3:19 where the angel taught, who came to King Benjamin and taught King Benjamin what to say when he came before the people. He told him that the natural man is an enemy to God and has been from the fall of Adam and will be forever and ever, unless what? Unless he changes. He yields to &quot;enticings of the Holy Spirit, putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ&quot; (Mosiah 3:19). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
So all of us, all of us, are under command of the Lord to change, to grow and develop in the way the Lord envisions us that we might return home to live with Him. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These two kinds of change, the institutional change in the kingdom and the change in us are deeply connected-deeply connected. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let me give you an example, a quick example. I want to give Elder Johnson enough time here today. If you go back and read President Eyring&#39;s talk or if you have prepared it, there is a passage in there about missionary work where he talks about of the true and living Church. One example he gives of the living Church is the faith of the members in the sharing of the gospel. He recounts the repeated wish of President Hinckley that we will retain a full fellowship of all of those that are baptized into the kingdom. President Eyring said, this is as I am quoting: 
</p>
<p>
	For years we have remembered the words of President David O. McKay: &quot;Every member a missionary.&quot; I am confident the day is coming that through the faith of the members we will see increasing numbers of people invited to hear the word of God who will then come into the true Church.( Eyring, &quot;The True and Living church, <em>Ensign, </em>May 2008, 20). 
	</p>
<p>
That takes change in us, change in our faith, in our witness, in our willingness to open our mouths. But there is also institutional change taking place, in missionary work - tremendous change if you think about it. Think just about <em>Preach My Gospel,</em> raising the bar for missionary service in terms of preparation of missionaries, the elimination of stake missions, placing responsibilities deeper in the wards, developing of ward missions, ward mission plans, new emphasis on the ward council, integration of missionary work, and reactivation. All of that is taking place in the kingdom right now. And so these two kinds of changes are deeply connected. We change the kingdom, and the earth rolls forth. The kingdom changes. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
That same pattern is in place at BYU-Idaho, that is we see around us change - institutional change, changes in our activities, in our patterns of behavior, but also changes in us. So this is the thought I would like to leave with you and pray that the Lord will bless you as you ponder it. We must become really good at change because change will never end in this university. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There are so many great things the Lord has in store for us, but change and being good at it is not a matter of clever techniques or good management practice or being really skillful at project management or creative strategy. It is not even about good sociology or having difficult conversations or any of those things. All those things are important, but it is really a matter of our personal spiritual growth. We as individuals must become more and more like the Savior: must become pure in heart; sanctified and consecrated; open to the whisperings of the spirit; close to heaven so that heaven can come and bless us with the power, the strength, and the revelation we need to accomplish the Lord&#39;s purposes in this great great place. As we do that, I know the Lord will work miracles in our midst, and not only here in this university, but in your lives and in the lives of your families. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
So I give you this promise and a blessing that as you heed the call of the Lord and the whisperings of the spirit to become more and more like the Savior, as you work to receive revelation in your work here in this university, the Lord will bless you and He will bless your family. You will feel the power of heaven in your life, and you will know that the Lord is at work not just here at BYU-Idaho but in your life and in the lives of those you love. I give you that blessing and that promise, and I bear my witness to you that this is the Lord&#39;s work. We have a loving Heavenly Father. He lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and the Redeemer. This is His church and kingdom. We are about His work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

I am grateful to be with you today on another great day at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In 1888 Jacob Spori, the first principal of the Bannock Stake Academy, stood not far from where we are today and spoke these prophetic words: 
</p>
<p>
	The seeds we are planting today will grow and become mighty oaks, and their branches will run all over the earth.<sup>1 </sup>
</p>
<p>
The Bannock Stake Academy eventually became Ricks College, and Ricks College became BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; Jacob Spori was a man of faith and vision, and his words about seeds and trees and the influence of this school are in fulfillment before our very eyes.&nbsp; You and this sacred and set apart place are the fulfillment of that great prophecy. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Today-some 120 years later-I, too, want to speak about seeds and trees.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today so that I may speak directly and personally to each one of you. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The mission of BYU-Idaho is to assist you in becoming a disciple of the Savior and a leader in your families, the Church, and the world around you.&nbsp; At the heart of that preparatory process is Student Honor.&nbsp; Listen to the words that we use to describe what we mean by Student Honor. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Student Honor is following the path of discipleship and learning to be more like Christ-learning to think, to feel, and to act more as He does. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, I hope you will live lives of honor.&nbsp; With all my heart, I want you to live the baseline standards and then build on that baseline to become more like the Savior.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This is the pattern we have established in Student Honor-live the baseline standards as your foundation and then build on that foundation to become more like Christ.&nbsp; It is a scriptural pattern.&nbsp; The great Book of Mormon prophet Alma taught this pattern to the people of Gideon in these words: 
</p>
<p>
	For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; . . . I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.&nbsp; <strong>[Live the baseline standards.]</strong>
</p>
<p>
	And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; . . . being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times. . . .<sup>2 </sup><strong>[Become more like Christ.]</strong>
</p>
<p>
In our discussions with you, Sister Clark and I have learned how you apply this pattern in your lives.&nbsp; There are two ways you become more like Christ: 
</p>
<p>
<em>1.&nbsp;You serve:</em>&nbsp; You follow the impressions of the Spirit to magnify your callings and serve those in need.&nbsp; As you serve the Lord, you become more like Him.&nbsp; In the words of President Benson, you &quot;day by day . . . move closer to the Lord, . . . [living] quiet lives of goodness, service, and commitment.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	2.&nbsp;<em>You seek:</em>&nbsp; Because you face challenges, the Holy Ghost guides you to humbly ask the Lord to bless you with more courage, or kindness, or patience, or love. &nbsp;You seek these gifts through the mercy and grace of the Savior. 
	</p>
<p>
The Lord has invited us to pursue both of these avenues.&nbsp; His invitations to &quot;feed my sheep&quot;<sup>4 </sup>and to &quot;take my yoke upon you&quot;<sup>5</sup> are examples of His call to us to <strong>serve </strong>in His kingdom.&nbsp; His invitations to &quot;come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift&quot;<sup>6</sup> and to &quot;seek me diligently and ye shall find me&quot;<sup>7</sup> are examples of His call to us to <strong>seek</strong> the blessings of Christlike virtues. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These two avenues are closely and intimately connected; one leads to the other and back and forth all through our lives. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I believe the avenues of serving and seeking are what Peter had in mind when he wrote these marvelous words in 2 Peter, chapter 1, verse 1 and verses 3-7: 
</p>
<p>
	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
	</p>
<p>
	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature . . . . 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<p>
As you act in faith with &quot;all diligence&quot; to serve and seek the Lord, you will realize &quot;exceeding great and precious promises.&quot;&nbsp; Through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His divine power, you can partake of the divine nature and become more and more like Him. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Peter&#39;s words are inspiring, full of hope and promise.&nbsp; But they also raise a very important question:&nbsp; What should you actually do to give &quot;all diligence&quot; as you serve and seek? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you a story about a young man who faced just this question.&nbsp; Mark is not a real person, but his story is based on real experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
After his first year at BYU-Idaho, Mark served a mission in Brazil.&nbsp; When he returned, his high school sweetheart Carol convinced him to move to Cedar City, Utah, where she was attending SUU on an athletic scholarship.&nbsp; Mark transferred to SUU, but things did not work out like he had hoped.&nbsp; After dating for three months, Carol told Mark she was not happy with their relationship and thought they ought to date other people. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark was hurt and confused, but he did not give up.&nbsp; Since he really loved Carol, he continued to talk with her and finally convinced her to see him again.&nbsp; Their relationship picked up and over the next few months went really well.&nbsp; At least that is what Mark believed.&nbsp; In fact, Mark thought things were going so well he bought a ring and proposed to Carol. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
On the night Mark proposed, Carol was surprised and upset.&nbsp; She turned Mark down and said things that really hurt Mark.&nbsp; Carol told him that she could see she would not be happy with him, that there were other guys she had met she wanted to date, and that it was time to move on.&nbsp; Mark was humiliated, frustrated, and angry; and he said some things in anger to Carol he should not have said. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark finished out the year at SUU, but he was unhappy and uncomfortable.&nbsp; It seemed to him that everything about SUU reminded him that Carol was the only reason he moved to Cedar City.&nbsp; He decided to return to BYU-Idaho. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the first year Mark returned to BYU-Idaho, he moved in with some old friends from his old ward; but he did not date anyone.&nbsp; He was still angry and hurt.&nbsp; He doubted himself and was deeply afraid of rejection.&nbsp; Instead of fading with time, the anger he felt toward Carol festered.&nbsp; The pain and self-doubt and fear were like a dull ache in his heart.&nbsp; He was moody and cynical (especially about girls).&nbsp; He let his calling in the ward and his home teaching slide, and his roommates grew worried about him.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
His roommates finally convinced Mark to go see the bishop.&nbsp; As he sat in the bishop&#39;s office that day, he knew that he should forgive Carol for the pain she had caused him, put his life in order, and get on with finding an eternal companion.&nbsp; But all of that seemed way too hard.&nbsp; It was as if he stood on one side of a great canyon needing to get to the other side, with no way across. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
But there was a way.&nbsp; There is a way-for all of us.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Despite challenges that seem daunting, we <u>can</u> act in faith in &quot;all diligence.&quot;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; We <u>have</u> received &quot;great and precious promises.&quot;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; It does not matter if we need the gift of more patience, or diligence, or courage, or charity.&nbsp; We can serve, and we can seek.&nbsp; We can become more like Christ. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Lord has given us a framework to help us understand how we may partake of the divine nature and receive the supernal blessings of Christlike virtues. &nbsp;At the heart of the framework is a beautiful metaphor of the tree of everlasting life &quot;which is precious above all,&quot;<sup>11</sup> &quot;the most desirable above all things,&quot;<sup>12</sup> &quot;and the most joyous to the soul.&quot;<sup>13&nbsp;</sup> At the Last Supper Jesus taught His disciples about the tree, its branches, and its fruit: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</p>
<p>
	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. 
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.<sup>14</sup>
</p>
<p>
The tree (the &quot;true vine&quot;) represents the Savior, and the fruit represents the gifts of His Atonement, including Christlike virtues.&nbsp; If we abide in Christ and He in us, we can receive these marvelous gifts (&quot;bear much fruit&quot;) through His power and His grace (&quot;for without me ye can do nothing&quot;). &nbsp;We partake of the divine nature because the tree of everlasting life is in us.&nbsp; Alma taught this same principle.&nbsp; Speaking of the good news of Christ&#39;s atoning sacrifice, he said: 
</p>
<p>
	&quot;. . . I desire that ye shall plant this word in your hearts, and . . . nourish it by your faith. &nbsp;And behold, it will become a tree, springing up <strong>in you</strong> unto everlasting life.&quot;<sup>15 </sup>
</p>
<p>
This was precisely what Mark needed. &nbsp;He had already planted the seed.&nbsp; He had served a mission and felt his testimony of the Savior grow. &nbsp;In his service to the Lord, the seed had sprouted and begun to grow; but it was not yet the magnificent tree of which Alma speaks. &nbsp;In fact, since the problems with Carol had festered, the young tree in Mark had stopped growing. Mark needed the tree to grow again and bear fruit. &nbsp;He needed to partake of the divine nature. &nbsp;He needed the gift of a merciful and forgiving heart, which he did not have. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/2008_09-09_Clark/Sapling.jpg" border="0" alt="Sapling bad earth" width="328" height="219" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In the Lord&#39;s framework, the first step in the growth of the tree is desire. &nbsp;Please turn with me to Alma, chapter 32, verse 27: 
</p>
<p>
	But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe <strong>[forgive]</strong>, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.<sup>16</sup>
</p>
<p>
Whether you are planting the seed for the first time or trying to rekindle growth in the tree, <em>desire is the beginning</em>. &nbsp;For Mark the critical question was: &nbsp;Do you want to forgive Carol?&nbsp; Do you want to be rid of the anger and the pain and everything that you are feeling?&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As Mark focused his mind and heart on what he really wanted, he realized he was sitting in the bishop&#39;s office because he wanted the anger and the pain to go away.&nbsp; It was the beginning of a desire to forgive. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With that beginning, Mark needed to take the second step and &quot;<em>give place&quot; in his heart to the word of the Lord about forgiveness and the Atonement</em>.&nbsp; The Lord said, &quot;Of you it is required to forgive all men.&quot;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp; He also said, &quot;I am Jesus Christ the Son of God . . . for behold, by me redemption cometh.&quot;<sup>18</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To &quot;give place&quot; in his heart for these words, Mark needed to see himself with the eye of faith as a new person-forgiving Carol-rid of the anger and the pain through the power and mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; For Mark to see himself with the eye of faith, he not only needed to imagine the tree growing and bearing fruit, but he needed to acknowledge in his mind and feel in his heart that it could happen.&nbsp; This is the beginning of hope. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This process did not happen all at once for Mark.&nbsp; There were more visits with the bishop, much prayer, and much searching of the scriptures.&nbsp; But there came a point where he really did see himself with the eye of faith.&nbsp; He began to see that the gift of forgiveness was possible.&nbsp; At that point, Mark took the third step:&nbsp; <em>he kept his heart open to the Spirit</em>.&nbsp; Alma&#39;s powerful promise in verse 28 became a reality.&nbsp; If you, too, will keep your heart open to the possibility of new growth, the Holy Ghost will cause the word of God to &quot;enlarge [your] soul; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;enlighten [your] understanding, . . . [and it will begin] to be delicious to [you].&quot;<sup>19</sup>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Just as life-giving moisture in fertile soil makes the young tree put out new roots and branches, the Holy Ghost makes the word of God come alive in the prepared heart.&nbsp; Let me give you an example of the word of God about the power of the Atonement and forgiveness. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Jesus suffered for our sins.&nbsp; But He also suffered our infirmities, our weaknesses, our pain, our humiliation, our self-doubt, our fear, and the effects of our anger.&nbsp; And He overcame them all.&nbsp; Everything we have suffered and are suffering, He suffered and overcame.&nbsp; This means that Mark did not need to carry the burden of fear, pain, and anger anymore.&nbsp; Jesus Christ, who has all power in heaven and in earth, who heals all wounds, would take the burden.&nbsp; Mark could give it to Lord; in fact, the Lord already had it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When this thought took hold in Mark&#39;s heart, it was truly delicious to him.&nbsp; His understanding increased, and he began to see and feel light coming into his life.&nbsp; There was greater hope than before, because the Word is true. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark had come a long way; but there was much, much more to do.&nbsp; The young tree had begun to grow, but it needed much more care.&nbsp; This was the fourth step:&nbsp; <em>nourishing the tree with great care</em>.&nbsp; Here is Alma again (verse 37): 
</p>
<p>
	And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .<sup>20</sup>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>
	But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root. . . . 
	</p>
<p>
	Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.<sup>21</sup>
</p>
<p>
Since we are growing a tree, it means there must be a sustained period of nourishing and cultivating before there will be fruit.&nbsp; And it means also that the nourishing must be done with &quot;great care.&quot;&nbsp; It is not easy to grow a fruit tree.&nbsp; But if it gets root and grows strong, the tree will bear fruit for a long, long time. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Nourishing with great care&quot; involved three things Mark&#39;s young tree needed to continue to grow and bear fruit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A fertile heart is a heart that is open to the Savior, ready to make new commitments of faith and righteousness.&nbsp; It is a heart where deep desires to be good and to do good combine with an attitude of willing obedience.&nbsp; It is a heart prepared to change.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/2008_09-09_Clark/FertileHeart.jpg" border="0" alt="Sapling with good earth" width="328" height="219" align="204" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
A barren heart is full of the rocks and dense clay of pride, selfishness, lust, and greed.&nbsp; It is a heart committed to anger and sin and disobedience.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/images/2008_09-09_Clark/BarrenHeart.jpg" border="0" alt="Sapling with bad earth" width="328" height="219" align="204" />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark&#39;s heart was open to the word of the Lord, but there were pockets of rocks and clay beneath the surface of his heart.&nbsp; His pride and the anger he had harbored toward Carol had hardened his heart.&nbsp; He had stopped being of service to others, and he had stopped feeling close to the Lord.&nbsp; The only way for the young tree to grow was for Mark to break up the rocks and the clay.&nbsp; Mark needed a broken heart.&nbsp; He had to change.&nbsp; Mark had to exercise his faith in Christ and repent of his lack of service and the pride, anger, and cynicism in his heart. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark learned something we all must learn: repentance is essential to the growth of the tree and its gifts of Christlike virtue.&nbsp; We all have in our hearts rocks and clay we need to break up.&nbsp; As we seek to become more like Christ, we all need to change.&nbsp; We all need hearts that are broken and spirits that are contrite.&nbsp; We all need to repent. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The young tree began to grow in Mark&#39;s heart because the Holy Ghost made the word of God come alive in him.&nbsp; Growth will continue only with the continued nourishment of the Spirit. The Holy Ghost knows exactly what Mark needs to receive the gift of forgiveness and mercy. Through the &quot;unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost,&quot;<sup>22</sup> Mark can receive increased faith and trust in God; deeper knowledge and understanding of the Atonement; feelings of love, peace, comfort and reassurance; increased empathy for others; and an increased testimony of the Savior. &nbsp;These are the nutrients Mark&#39;s young tree needs to grow and bear its precious fruit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark knew from his mission and other experiences that to have the Spirit with him he needed to pray always with real intent, to feast on the words of Christ, to keep the commandments, and to do nothing that would drive the Spirit away.&nbsp; Mark&#39;s bishop reminded him of these things and also taught him that service to others would bring the Spirit into his life.&nbsp; The bishop promised that the Lord would bless Mark with a forgiving heart if Mark would act on the promptings of the Spirit to serve others. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mark&#39;s young tree needed to sink many roots down deep in his heart.&nbsp; Deep and extensive roots anchor the tree, protecting it against the winds and storms of life.&nbsp; Deep roots secure the nourishment an abundance of fruit will require.&nbsp; But deep and extensive roots also protect the soil of the heart, keeping us safe from floods of anger or despair or temptation and binding our commitments and desires to the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
With a fertile heart and nourishment of the Spirit, the young tree can begin to take root.&nbsp; But Mark can act in faith to strengthen and deepen those roots.&nbsp; He can begin with his roommates, making sure the old cynical, angry, moody Mark does not reappear, watching carefully to be kind to them, to serve them, and to forgive them.&nbsp; He can love and serve others he knows.&nbsp; Here is an example: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Acting on a prompting, Mark decided to go see Bill, one of the students Mark home taught.&nbsp; Bill had never gotten along very well with Mark, but Mark made the visit.&nbsp; Mark arrived just in time to help Bill clean up a big mess caused by a flooding dishwasher.&nbsp; (Bill had put liquid dish soap in the machine.) &nbsp;That experience was an important lesson in forgiveness and the beginning of a great friendship. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It took time and &quot;all diligence&quot;<sup>23</sup>; but with much prayer, repentance, and service, Mark&#39;s heart began to change. &nbsp;The old cynicism and anger began to disappear.&nbsp; In its place came light and joy and confidence in the Lord.&nbsp; It was not easy.&nbsp; It did not happen quickly, but the &quot;great and precious promises&quot;<sup>24</sup> came true.&nbsp; Through the ministry of the Holy Ghost, the power of the Atonement worked in Mark according to his faithfulness.&nbsp; He received the gift of a merciful and forgiving heart.&nbsp; Mark nourished the tree, and he tasted its fruit. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The day came when Mark called Carol and apologized to her for his angry words those many months ago and sought her forgiveness.&nbsp; Carol told Mark she was sorry for the pain she had caused him, and Mark was so happy that he could say to her in all sincerity of heart that he had forgiven her and wished for her nothing but the best. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, Mark&#39;s story can be your story.&nbsp; If you are at the beginning of testimony and faith in Christ, you can plant the seed of the word of God and with &quot;all diligence&quot;<sup>25</sup> nurture the tree so that it gets root and bears fruit.&nbsp; If you, like Mark, have planted the seed but need to renew growth in the tree, you, too, can repent, serve the Lord, and seek the nourishment of the Spirit. &nbsp;If you have already planted and nourished the tree and tasted of its fruit, more growth and more blessings lie ahead for you too. 
</p>

&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Lord&#39;s invitation to you is to serve Him and seek Him all of your lives. &nbsp;He wants you to have the tree of everlasting life in you-a tree with deep, extensive roots; a tree with many strong branches; a tree with an abundance of fruit. &nbsp;This is your destiny. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters, I stand before you today as a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. &nbsp;He lives! &nbsp;This is His Church and kingdom, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; The Savior leads His Church today through His living prophet, Thomas S. Monson. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is the great miracle of the tree of everlasting life. &nbsp;I know from my own experience that the &quot;exceeding great and precious promises&quot;<sup>26</sup> are true. &nbsp;With all the energy of my soul, I pray that you will serve the Lord and seek Him with all your hearts, living lives of Honor and becoming more and more like Him. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I leave you with my love, my witness, and this blessing.&nbsp; If you will plant the word of God and nurture it with diligence and faith, the gospel of Jesus Christ will sink down deep in your heart and the tree that is Christ will spring up in you unto everlasting life. &nbsp;You will partake of the divine nature and know and feel the glorious blessings of the Atonement of Christ.&nbsp; Through your faithfulness, the gifts of His virtues and His redeeming love will be in and abide in you forever.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

		Last year at Christmastime our grandchildren built a really big snowman 
		in our yard.&nbsp; By the end of January that snowman had disappeared in the

		We have some close friends who had twins.&nbsp; One of the babies was born 
		with a disease that threatened to take his life at a very young age.&nbsp; 
		Through many surgeries and lots of prayer and faith, he survived; but 
		was left blind and handicapped.&nbsp; Brians mom and dad had to work very 
		hard and spend lots of time and effort to help him as he grew and 
		developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;They had other children and other pressures in their lives, 
		and taking care of Brian could have been a burden and trial for his 
		family.&nbsp; But it wasnt. &nbsp;It did take a lot of effort, but they 
		recognized the Lords hand in their lives and looked to Him for help.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am so honored to be 
			with you today.&nbsp; I was originally scheduled to be here in January.&nbsp; 
			Now, I love Rexburg and this campus, but given the choice of being 
			here in January or Septemberwell, I was thrilled when the call came 
			asking me if I could switch to September.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I love the opportunity I 
			have as a faculty member at BYU to work and interact with wonderful 
			young men and women like you.&nbsp; When I stand in front of my classes, 
			I can see and feel the light that radiates from your faces.&nbsp; It is a 
			light that comes because you are goodbecause you are filled with 
			that spirit that gives light to all men and women.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Today, I want to talk to 
			you about times of darkness, both physical and spiritual, and hope 
			that what I have to share with you will strengthen your testimonies, 
			and perhaps brighten the light that glows within you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Two of the plagues sent 
			upon Pharaoh and the Egyptians have always struck me as particularly 
			interesting. In Exodus 9:23-34 we read, And Moses stretched forth 
			his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the 
			fire ran along the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of 
			Egypt.&nbsp; So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very 
			grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt 
			since it became a nation.&nbsp; Again in Exodus 10:21-22 we read, And 
			the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out <span class="SpellE">thine</span> 
			hand toward the heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of 
			Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.&nbsp; And Moses stretched forth 
			his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the 
			land of Egypt three days</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In this account, I would 
			like you to pay special attention to the following phrases:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">thunder and hail</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">fire ran along the 
				ground</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span class="GramE">hail,</span> 
				and fire mingled with hail</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">such as there was 
				none like itsince Egypt became a nation</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span class="GramE">
				darkness which may be felt</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Most of you have probably 
			witnessed a hail storm before and they are often accompanied by 
			thunder, but how many of you have seen a hail storm mingled with 
			fire, fire that runs along the ground and is described as different 
			from anything seen before?&nbsp; This hail storm, interestingly, is 
			followed some time later (we dont know from the account how long) 
			by thick darknessdarkness that can be felt?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another similar account 
			of a time of darkness is found in 3 Nephi 8.&nbsp; In verse 5 the 
			account states, And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, 
			in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a 
			great storm, such <span class="GramE">an</span> one as never had 
			been known in all the land. This account goes on to outline all of 
			the following physical events that occurred at this time in some 
			particularly descriptive language:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -great 
			stormsuch as had never been known</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -terrible 
			thunder</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -exceedingly 
			sharp <span class="SpellE">lightnings</span>, such as never had been 
			known</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -cities 
			burning</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -cities 
			sinking into the sea</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -cities where 
			the earth was carried up upon them</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -the whole 
			face of the land was changed</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -whirlwinds 
			(tornadoes)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -quaking of 
			the whole earth for three hours</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -rocks and 
			earth broken up and scattered</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -darkness 
			that could be felt, lasting for three days</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The events that occurred 
			in both of these accounts have some similarities and also 
			significant differences.&nbsp; In both cases, there was spiritual and 
			physical darkness, followed by spiritual and physical 
			enlightenment.&nbsp; In the case of the children of Israel, Moses led 
			them out of the servitude and repression of Egypt and into the 
			desert where they were guarded by the Pillar of Fire sent from God 
			and instructed in his ways by a holy prophet.&nbsp; In the case of the
			<span class="SpellE">Nephites</span> and <span class="SpellE">
			Lamanites</span>, most of the people had become very wicked, 
			rejecting the light of the gospel.&nbsp; Then, after the darkness, Christ 
			comes, bringing with him light and truth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The similarities in the 
			physical events between the two accounts include: 1) darkness that 
			can be felt lasting for 3 days, and 2) a great storm with thunder 
			and fire such as had never been seen before.&nbsp; The differences are 
			that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Nephi account mentions several types of 
			events not mentioned in Exodus, such as shaking of the earth for 3 
			hours, whirlwinds, and different types of destruction for various 
			cities.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These two events occurred 
			on different continents and at different times, one long before the 
			time of Christ in Egypt and the other in the western hemisphere at 
			the time of his death.&nbsp; Is there some common cause, some natural 
			phenomenon that could explain both occurrences?&nbsp; I believe there 
			isand the type of event that is needed is a large, explosive 
			volcanic eruption. These photos show the explosive eruption of Mount 
			Saint Helens in Washington State back in 1980 and give us, perhaps, 
			some idea of what one of these eruptions is like. This map shows the 
			extent of the ash that erupted from Mount St. Helens.&nbsp; Focus 
			particularly on the red and orange regions where enough ash 
			accumulated to be measured as over ½ inch thick. Now for comparison, 
			look at the size of the Mount St. Helens eruption with other 
			historic eruptions (some of which I will discuss more later on).&nbsp; 
			Compared to some of these other historic eruptions, Mount St. Helens 
			was small.&nbsp; If we add the prehistoric eruptions from the Yellowstone 
			caldera near your campus, we can see that even these other historic 
			eruptions are dwarfed by the monsters that came out of Yellowstone.&nbsp; 
			The Yellowstone eruptions were like thousands of Mount St Helens 
			erupting at the same time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Scientists who study 
			these explosive volcanoes have learned that they are capable of 
			producing a wide variety of natural phenomena, which include 
			extremely powerful winds, shaking of the earth for several hours, 
			spectacular lightning and thunder, tsunamis, landslides, and 
			darkness for several days. &nbsp;However, in order to find descriptions 
			that are similar to what the Children of Israel and the
			<span class="SpellE">Nephites</span> saw and recorded, we must look, 
			not only in the scientific literature, but also in first-hand 
			accounts from those who have actually experienced a similar event.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I do not have time today 
			to go through the hundreds of scientific and eyewitness accounts of 
			explosive volcanic eruptions, but we can highlight a few of them 
			here.&nbsp; Lets start with <span class="GramE">a the</span> terrible 
			winds produced by these eruptions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Wind and Fire</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The winds produced by 
			explosive volcanic eruptions are stronger and more devastating than 
			any hurricane. When Mont <span class="SpellE">Pelee</span> erupted 
			in 1902, St. Pierre was a city of almost 40,000 people with a busy 
			port and bustling rum trade. After the eruption only two people were 
			found still alive. &nbsp;F.M. Bullard, in his book <i>Volcanoes of the 
			Earth</i>, describes the power of this rush of ash and volcanic gas 
			on and over the city of St. Pierre.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">A</span>All the 
			houses in St. Pierre were unroofed and otherwise demolished either 
			in part or totally.&nbsp; The trees were stripped of leaves and branches 
			down to the bare trunks.&nbsp; The force of the blast is shown by the 
			fact that walls of cement and stone, three feet in thickness, were 
			torn to pieces as though made of cardboardcentury-old trees were 
			uprooted, and a statue of the Virgin Mary, weighing at least three 
			tons, was carried 50 feet from its base.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to the winds 
			created by the volcanic blast, whirlwinds, or tornados, appear to 
			also be a fairly common feature.&nbsp; The hot ash erupting into the air 
			is a concentrated source of heat that causes severe updrafts, 
			providing ideal conditions for the formation of whirlwinds.&nbsp; The 
			heat of the eruption can also create fires, as in this eyewitness 
			account from an Assistant <span class="SpellE">Pursor</span> by the 
			name of Thompson on board the ship <span class="SpellE"><i>Roraima</i></span>, 
			which was just approaching the harbor in St. Pierre at the time of 
			the eruption of Mt. <span class="SpellE">Pelée</span>:</font></p>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">A</span>I saw St. 
			Pierre destroyed. It was blotted out by one great flash of fire.&nbsp; 
			Nearly 40,000 people were killed at once.&nbsp; Of eighteen vessels lying 
			in the Roads, only one, the British steamship <span class="SpellE">
<i>Roddam</i></span> escaped and she, I hear, lost more than half on 
			board.&nbsp; It was a dying crew that took her out.&nbsp; Our boat, the
			<span class="SpellE"><i>Roraima</i></span>, arrived at St. Pierre 
			early Thursday morning.&nbsp; For hours before we entered the roadstead, 
			we could see flames and smoke rising from Mt. <span class="SpellE">

			<span class="SpellE">Muggah</span> was on bridge and all hands got 
			on deck to see the show.&nbsp; The spectacle was magnificent.&nbsp; As we 
			approached St. Pierre, we could distinguish the rolling and leaping 
			red flames that belched from the mountain in huge volumes and gushed 
			high into the sky.&nbsp; Enormous clouds of black smoke hung over the 
			volcano.&nbsp; The flames were then spurting straight up in the air, now 
			and then waving to one side or the other a moment, and again leaping 
			suddenly higher up.&nbsp; There was a constant muffled roar.&nbsp; It was like 
			the biggest oil refinery in the world burning up on the mountain 
			top.&nbsp; There was a tremendous explosion about 7:45 soon after we got 
			in.&nbsp; The mountain was blown to pieces.&nbsp; There was no warning.&nbsp; The 
			side of the volcano was ripped <span class="GramE">out,</span> and 
			there hurled straight towards us a solid wall of flame.&nbsp; It sounded

			huge whirlpools that careened toward the open sea.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Lightning and Thunder 
			such as had never been known</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another common feature of 
			explosive volcanic eruptions is lightning and thunder.&nbsp; These 
			lightning displays and associated thunder, along with other noises 
			caused by explosions near a volcano, can be extraordinary and 
			unusual. The lightning is caused by the friction between the 
			exploding ash and the air.&nbsp; This friction generates enormous 
			quantities of static electricity that is then discharged as 
			lightning.&nbsp; The thunder from the lightning is supplemented by the 
			explosions from the volcano and the earthquakes that occur almost 
			continuously during some eruptions.&nbsp; Here are a few pictures of 
			these lightning displays over erupting volcanoes.&nbsp; Many eyewitnesses 
			mention this phenomenon.&nbsp; For example, Captain Logan<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">=</span>s 
			on board the ship <span class="SpellE"><i>Berbice</i></span><i> </i>
			in the <span class="SpellE">Sunda</span> Straits recorded the 
			following:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">A</span>The 
			lightning and thunder became worse and worse; the lightning flashes 
			shot past and around the ship; fire-balls continually fell on the 
			deck, and burst into sparks.&nbsp; We saw flashes of lightning falling 
			quite close to us on the ship; heard fearful rumblings and 
			explosions, sometimes upon the deck and sometimes among the 
			rigging.&nbsp; The man at the wheel felt strong electric shocks on one 
			arm.&nbsp; The copper sheathing of the rudder became glowing from the 
			electric discharges.&nbsp; Fiery phenomena on board the ship manifested 
			themselves at every moment.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">During the eruption of 
			Mount St. Helens in 1980,
			<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">A</span>lightning 
			and other electrical phenomena associated with the eruption were so 
			spectacular that many witnesses mentioned them.....Beneath any part 
			of the eruptive <span class="GramE">cloud,</span> radios became 
			useless because of static...Someof the lightning appeared red.&nbsp; It 
			wasn't normal lightning<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">C</span>first 
			a white dot appeared in the cloud, and then a bolt would shoot out 
			from it.&nbsp; [Other] lightning was in ball form streaking toward the 
			ground, connected neither with the cloud nor the ground...[One 
			eyewitness said that] after the cloud passed overhead, lots of 
			lightning started 600-800 ft in the air and formed big balls, big as 
			a pickup [truck] and [then it] just started rolling across the 
			ground and bouncing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One additional thing we 
			learn from the descriptions and photos of lightning and thunder 
			around explosive volcanic eruptions is that these phenomena often 
			occur without rainfall, so that the wood for fires could still be
			<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">A</span>exceedingly 
			dry,<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">@</span> as 
			mentioned in the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; The reason the fires could not be 
			lit is because of the smothering effect of the falling volcanic 
			ash.&nbsp; Rapidly falling ash can accumulate to several inches thick in 
			a few minutes, even at considerable distances from the erupting 
			volcano.&nbsp; In 1883, when Krakatau erupted, the <span class="SpellE">
			Beyerinck</span> family was living in a village about 15 miles from

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The thunderous noises 
			produced by an eruption may carry for distances of several hundred 
			miles.&nbsp; &quot;In April, 1815, one of the most frightful eruptions 
			recorded in history occurred in the mountain <span class="SpellE">
			Tambora</span>, in the island of SumbawaThe sound of the explosions 
			was heard in Sumatra, at the distance of 970 geographical miles in a 
			direct line, and at Ternate in an opposite direction, at the 
			distance of 720 miles.&nbsp; The area over which tremulous noises and

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Shaking of the earth 
			for several hours</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The shaking of the earth 
			was observed by the Book of Mormon peoples, but is not mentioned in 
			Exodus.&nbsp; This is probably because the Book of Mormon peoples were 
			much closer to the actual eruption.&nbsp; Shaking for several hours is 
			not unusual in large volcanic eruptions.&nbsp; Several hours of shaking 
			are too long a time period to have been produced by a single large 
			earthquake; however, it is a very reasonable amount of time for the 
			initial stages of a volcanic eruption.&nbsp; We might call this the
			<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">A</span>throat-clearing 
			stage<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">@</span> of 
			the eruption.&nbsp; It is when the volcano is cleaning out its vent of 
			the rock and debris that has plugged it up.&nbsp; During this time 
			frequent explosions and earthquakes occur.&nbsp; Once the vent is 
			cleared, the volcano may continue to erupt for several hours or days 
			without additional significant earthquakes.&nbsp; For example, during the 
			eruption of Krakatau the shaking of the earth lasted throughout the 
			night on August 26, 1883 and on into the next morning.&nbsp; The power 
			released in the Krakatau eruption has been estimated to be the 
			equivalent of 20,000 atomic.</font></p>

			Destruction of Cities by burial, drowning, fire, etc.</i></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are many ways 
			cities and towns can be destroyed around an explosive volcanic 
			eruption.&nbsp; As I noted earlier, the city of St. Pierre was destroyed 
			by the winds generated in the explosive blast of the volcano.&nbsp; In 
			many eruptions, landslides, volcanic mudflows, and the fall of 
			volcanic ash can destroy cities both near the volcano and even 
			several tens of miles distant from the volcano.&nbsp; Pompeii, for 
			example, was buried in the fall of volcanic ash preserving these 
			casts those who did not heed the warnings to leave.
			<span class="GramE">the</span> city of <span class="SpellE">Armero</span> 
			in Colombia was buried under a volcanic mudflow killing 26,000 
			people in the city.&nbsp; During the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, an island 
			volcano off the coast of Java, 165 villages were completely, and 132 
			partly, destroyed by tsunami, killing approximately 33,000 people. 
			Waves crashing on the shores near Krakatau reached heights of over 
			130 feet.&nbsp; One elderly Dutchman saw the wave approaching and left 
			this account:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The eruption began 
				on the Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; We did not take much notice at first, 
				untilwe noticed that Krakatau was completely enveloped in 
				smoke.&nbsp; Afterwards came on the thick darkness, so black and 
				intense that I could not see my hand before my eyesAlthough
				<span class="SpellE">Krakatoa</span> was twenty-five miles away, 
				the concussion and vibration from the constantly repeated shocks 
				was most terrifying.&nbsp; Many of the houses shook so much that we 
				feared every minute would bring them down.&nbsp; There was little 
				sleep for any of us that dreadful night.&nbsp; Before daybreak on 
				Monday, on going out of doors, I found the shower of ashes had 
				commenced, and this gradually increased in force until at length 
				large pieces of pumice-stone kept falling around.&nbsp; About six 
				a.m. I was walking along the beach.&nbsp; There was no sign of the 
				sun, as usual, and the sky had a dull, depressing look.&nbsp; Some of 
				the darkness of the previous day had cleared off, but it was not 
				very light even then.&nbsp; Looking out to sea I noticed a dark black 
				object through the gloom, traveling towards the shore.&nbsp; At first 
				sight it seemed like a low range of hills rising out of the 
				water, but I knew there was nothing of the kind in that part of 
				theStrait.&nbsp; A second glance<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">C</span>and 
				a very hurried one it was<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">C</span>convinced 
				me that it was a lofty ridge of water many feet high, and worse 
				still, that it would soon break upon the coast near the town,&nbsp; 
				There was no time to give any warning, and so I turned and ran 
				for my life.&nbsp; My running days have long gone by, but you may be 
				sure that I did my best.&nbsp; In a few minutes I heard the water 
				with a loud roar break upon the shore.&nbsp; Everything was 
				engulfed.&nbsp; Another glance around showed the houses being swept 
				away and the trees thrown down on every side.&nbsp; Breathless and 
				exhausted I still pressed on.&nbsp; As I heard the rushing waters 
				behind me, I knew that it was a race for life.&nbsp; Struggling on, a 
				few yards more brought me to some rising ground, and here the 
				torrent of water overtook me.&nbsp; I gave up all for lost, as I saw 
				with dismay how high the wave still was.&nbsp; I was soon taken off 
				my feet and borne inland by the force of the resistless mass.&nbsp; I 
				remember nothing more until a violent blow aroused me.&nbsp; Some 
				hard firm substance seemed within my reach, and clutching it I 
				found I had gained a place of safety.&nbsp; The waters swept past, 
				and I found myself clinging to a cocoanut palm-tree.&nbsp; Most of 
				the trees near the town were uprooted and thrown down for miles, 
				but this one fortunately had escaped and myself with it.&nbsp; The 
				huge wave rolled on, gradually decreasing in height and strength 
				until the mountain slopes at the back of <span class="SpellE">
				Anjer</span> were reached, and then, its fury
				<span class="GramE">spent,</span> the waters gradually receded 
				and flowed back into the sea.&nbsp; The sight of those receding 
				waters haunts me still.&nbsp; As I clung to the palm-tree, wet and 
				exhausted, there floated past the dead bodies of many a friend 
				and neighbor.&nbsp; Only a mere handful of the population escaped.&nbsp; 
				Houses and streets were completely destroyed, and scarcely a 
				trace remains of where the once busy, thriving town originally 
				stood.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If I had time, I could go 
			on and provide you with modern eyewitness accounts of explosive 
			volcanic eruptions that describe every one of the features in the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
			Nephi and Exodus accounts.&nbsp; But what is the real point here?&nbsp; Today, 
			more than ever, those who want to destroy your testimony, those who 
			want to extinguish the light within you and plunge you into 
			darknessand there are more than a few who desire to do thisthese 
			people are attacking the Book of Mormon and questioning its 
			historicity.&nbsp; So what is so remarkable about the account of a 
			volcanic eruption in the Book of Mormon?&nbsp; No doubt the nay-<span class="SpellE">sayers</span> 
			could propose that Joseph Smith simply read an account of a volcanic 
			eruption and thought it would make a nice backdrop for the 
			destruction he envisioned occurring at Christ<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">=</span>s 
			death.&nbsp; They might even point out the similarities to the Exodus 
			account.&nbsp; However, I would answer that the Book of Mormon account is 
			remarkable for its detail and accuracy; that it is quite different 
			from the Exodus account in so many ways; and that such an account 
			would have been impossible for an uneducated, young man to write in 
			1830.&nbsp; Volcanoes were not well understood nor well documented in the 
			early 1800's.&nbsp; Geology was a science still in its infancy.&nbsp; The 
			first real textbook of geology was published the same year as the 
			Book of Mormon, 1830, by Charles Lyell in Great Britain.&nbsp; But 
			Lyells descriptions of volcanic eruptions, as well as the few other 
			accounts available in Joseph Smith<span style="font-family: WP TypographicSymbols">=</span>s 
			day, are incomplete and do not include all the features found in the 
			Book of Mormon account, features that are now known to regularly 
			occur with large explosive eruptions.&nbsp; For me, this strengthens my 
			testimony of this wonderful book.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I believe that there is 
			an even greater lesson to be learned here, however.&nbsp; When you leave 
			this great university, you will be challenged many times throughout 
			your life by those who do not believe.&nbsp; You may be tempted to join 
			them.&nbsp; If you do, I can promise you that the light of the spirit 
			that burns so bright within you <span class="GramE">today,</span> 
			will turn to darkness.&nbsp; It is a darkness that can be feltfelt by 
			you and by those who know and love you. It is a terrible thing to 
			see that light go out in someone you loveand it is not death that 
			extinguishes itit is sin and doubt and anger and envy.&nbsp; I have seen 
			it happen in the lives of some of my own close friends.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On the other hand, if you 
			keep your testimony strong, if you stay close to the spirit, others 
			will see the gospel light in your faces and it will be a beacon to 
			the world.&nbsp; It is a light that can dispel the darkness.&nbsp; You can be 
			an incredible force for good in this world, just by being who you 
			are.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Forgive me for taking 
			just a moment to emphasize with a personal example the power of your 
			light to those in the world who are not members of the church, and 
			in many cases have never seen young people like you.&nbsp; My wife and I 
			do not watch very much TV; we simply dont have time.&nbsp; However, we 
			have enjoyed watching American Idol for the past few years.&nbsp; This 
			past year, two wonderful young LDS singers were in the competition.&nbsp; 
			I was so proud of the way they performed.&nbsp; Both Brooke White and 
			David Archuleta represented the church well.&nbsp; Now, I do not know 
			either of these two young people well, but my wife and I have become 
			acquainted with David Archuletas family and friends.&nbsp; David is a 
			17-year-old active member of the Church from Murray, Utah and is 
			normally somewhat shy.&nbsp; He is also a humble, caring, and polite 
			young man.&nbsp; Even with all the accolades he has received, he still 
			finds it hard to believe that anyone really likes to listen to him 
			sing.&nbsp; During the American Idol competition, and as he has toured 
			the country, many, many people have been drawn to him because they 
			saw something in David that they didnt quite understand.&nbsp; Just like 
			most of you, David glowsone of the judges, during the competition, 
			even commented that he had a glorious aura about him.&nbsp; I dont 
			have time to go into details here, but just with our limited 
			knowledge of events, my wife and I know of a middle-aged woman in 
			New York who was so touched by David that she let two Mormon Elders 
			into her home, not knowing at the time that they belonged to the 
			same faith as David did.&nbsp; She was baptized in May and spent a week 
			with us in July.&nbsp; We know of a talented young man the same age as 
			David from Arizona who grew up without a father and with very little 
			guidance from his motherbut he found a way to get to Utah, to find 
			and be taken in by Davids family and friends.&nbsp; He was baptized in 
			July in Murray at a service we were privileged to attend.&nbsp; We know 
			of a 25-year-old young lady in Mississippi who grew up in an abusive 
			home and knew nothing about religion, but saw something she could 
			not explain in David.&nbsp; She stayed with us for a few days in May and 
			is currently taking the missionary discussions.&nbsp; We know of a 
			35-year-old man from Texas, a middle-aged lady from Arizona, a young 
			college student in Tennessee, a woman in Canadaall now either 
			investigating the Church or already baptized because they saw 
			something different in David.&nbsp; None of these people fall into the 
			category of young, teen-aged girls that the news media tell us
			<span class="GramE">comprise</span> the bulk of Davids fans.&nbsp; To 
			accomplish this, all David has done is be himself remain true to 
			himself.&nbsp; He hasnt been preachy or pushy about the gospel; in fact 
			he has hardly mentioned the Church, except when asked specifically 
			about it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I share this with you, 
			because I believe that each of you, by staying true to the 
			principles of the gospel, by allowing your light to shine, can and 
			will have this same kind of impact on those you work with and meet 
			throughout the world.&nbsp; The world today is in darkness and, according 
			to what I read in the news, its getting darker.&nbsp; More than ever, 
			your light is needed to shine forth as a rescue beacon for those who 
			are seeking the truth.&nbsp; I know, and I want you to know, that the 
			Book of Mormon is a true record, that Joseph Smith was a true 
			prophet of God, and that we have a great giftthe light of the 
			gospel that we can and must share with those not of our faith. The 
			Savior said, Ye are the light of the world &nbsp;If you let that light 
			shine, the darkness of the world cannot dim nor extinguish it.&nbsp; It 
			is my pray that we can all let our light so shine before men that 
			those who are in darkness may see. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Good afternoon, brothers and 
		sisters.&nbsp; It is a great pleasure for my wife and I to be here with you 
		today.&nbsp; It has been my privilege to speak at several devotionals over 
		the years, both when it was Ricks College, and then as BYUIdaho.&nbsp; In 
		fact, it has been long enough since we were last here that I could say, 
		if you were here the last time we were, unless you are faculty or staff, 
		it is time to choose a major, get your degree and get on with your life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I express appreciation to the 
		choir for that beautiful rendition of the text of Matthew 11:28-30.&nbsp; I 
		consider it to be one of the most beautiful and profound passages in all 
		of scripture.&nbsp; Since this scripture is the basis for my talk this 
		afternoon, I should like to read it to you again.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy 
		laden, and I will give you rest.&nbsp; Take my yoke upon you, and learn of 
		me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your 
		souls.&nbsp; For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light (Matthew 11:28-30).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The more I study and ponder 
		these words, the more significance I find in them.&nbsp; There are wonderful 
		insights to be found in every phrase.&nbsp; Let us analyze it together, to 
		see if we can come to a greater understanding of this remarkable 
		invitation.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first thing we note from 
		the opening phrase, <b>Come unto me</b>, is that this passage is 
		written in the first person.&nbsp; It is Jesus Himself speaking.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second thing to note is 
		the very first word, come.&nbsp; Though this is put in the imperative form, 
		it feels much more like an entreaty or an appeal than a command.&nbsp; The 
		tone is gentle and inviting, not demanding.&nbsp; It is not like, Come here, 
		Bill!, but more like a supplication, Come.&nbsp; I invite you to join me.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next phrase answers an 
		important question. To whom is the Savior speaking?&nbsp; The answer is 
		clear:&nbsp; Come unto me, <b>all ye that labour and are heavy laden.&nbsp; </b>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Note His use of the word, 
		all.&nbsp; That is a sweeping inclusion, and worthy of further 
		examination.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I suppose that for most of 
		you wonderful young adults here in Rexburg, life is good.&nbsp; You're young 
		and healthy.&nbsp; Your parents are paying most, if not of all your 
		expenses.&nbsp; You have comfortable housing and plenty to eat.&nbsp; (If you 
		happen to be cooking your own food, well, that may be another matter.)&nbsp; 
		Rexburg and its surrounding communities provide a wonderful place to 
		live.&nbsp; There is very little crime.&nbsp; There is a new temple next door.&nbsp; 
		And, of course, there are always the brisk, invigorating winters.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But I am very sure there are 
		some in this audience todayand not just us older oneswho found 
		yourself nodding when I read the words of the Savior.&nbsp; I thought I heard 
		a chorus of inner voices saying something like, Yes, that's me.&nbsp; Life
		<i>is </i>a labor.&nbsp; The load I carry is almost more than I can bear.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Years ago, when I was serving 
		as a new bishop in Bountiful, Utah, I received some wonderful advice 
		from a good friend and experienced priesthood leader.&nbsp; I shall quote him 
		as best as I remember it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was a new bishop, he 
		said, I used to sit on the stand in sacrament meeting and look out over 
		my congregation.&nbsp; I would notice a new family sitting near the back and 
		think to myself, Oh, that must be the Jones family who just moved in by 
		the Browns.&nbsp; I wonder what we could call them to do.&nbsp; But after I had 
		been a bishop for a year or so, he went on, I would sit on the stand 
		and look out and see a new family, and say to myself, Oh, a new 
		family.&nbsp; I wonder what problems they have?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At first I thought his 
		statement was a bit of an exaggeration.&nbsp; When he said that everyone had 
		problems, I thought he was talking about spiritual problems. But as 
		my service as a bishop continued, I quickly learned something.&nbsp; I could 
		drive through my ward and point to virtually any house and name a 
		problem that family, or individuals in that family, were facing.&nbsp; Aging 
		parents; wayward children; some kind of health crisis; depression or 
		anxiety; mental health challenges; a crumbling marriage; family members 
		struggling with addiction; loss of employment and the resulting 
		financial crisis; The list of possibilities is virtually endless.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I'm not 
		trying to sound grim.&nbsp; I love life.&nbsp; I find it to be a wonderful gift.&nbsp; 
		Like many of you, my wife and I can also say, Life is good.&nbsp; But we 
		have also learned why the Lord told Adam and Eve that outside the Garden 
		it was a lone and dreary world.&nbsp; Paradise was all fruits and flowers 
		growing spontaneously.&nbsp; No mosquitoes, cockroaches, bedbugs, or other 
		such telestial creatures.&nbsp; (That last is an assumption on my part of 
		course.)&nbsp; There was no death, no cancer, no briars or noxious weeds, no 
		war, no terrorists, no drug cartels.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We were born into a fallen 
		world where all of the things I have just described are not only 
		realities but seem to be closing in more and more around us.&nbsp; Such a 
		world is necessary for our progression, but sometimes this educational 
		experience just ain't much fun, is it.&nbsp; As a good friend of mine put 
		it, The thing I have noticed about life is that it is so. . . 
		relentless.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To whom was Jesus speaking 
		when He said, Come unto me?&nbsp; He was speaking to you and me; to our 
		neighbors across the street or in the upstairs apartment; to kings and 
		paupers, beggars and tycoons.&nbsp; Come unto me, ALL ye that labour and are 
		heavy laden.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Next comes a promise.&nbsp; To 
		those who are burdened and labor much, He says:&nbsp; <b>I will give you 
		rest.</b>&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Rest from what?&nbsp; That is not 
		a simple question to answer.&nbsp; When we have worked hard, there is great 
		satisfaction in putting down the pick and shovel, turning off the 
		computer, or stripping off the surgical gloves and mask, and just 
		quitting our labor.&nbsp; Could that be what Jesus meant?&nbsp; That if we come 
		unto Him, He will take away the burdens?&nbsp; Fruits and flowers will start 
		spontaneously bursting out all over lives?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll 
		speak more on this later. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next phrase is our 
		scriptural passage contains another directiveactually two more 
		directives.&nbsp; <b>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 5.0pt"><font color="#000080">
		Yoke is a most fascinating choice of words here, and is worthy of 
		further exploration.&nbsp; Webster defines a yoke in two ways: It is first, 
		a wooden bar or frame by which two draft animals (such as oxen) are 
		joined together for working purposes. Here is a yoke, or span, of 
		oxen.&nbsp; You can see how they are joined together by the yoke, which fits 
		around their neck. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second definition is 
		similar, but refers to people and not animals.&nbsp; A yoke is a frame 
		fitted to a person's shoulders to help them carry a load in two equal 
		portions. Here is a woman using a yoke to carry water.&nbsp; Notice that it 
		too fits around her neck and distributes the weight to her shoulders.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Did you notice that both 
		definitions have something in common.&nbsp; A yoke is a device used to help 
		people or animals carry or pull their burdens more easily.&nbsp; So to put 
		the scripture in more modern terms, the Savior is saying, Come unto me, 
		all ye who labor under a heavy load, and let me provide the help you 
		need to carry it.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here is another thing about 
		yokes that I find interesting.&nbsp; Jesus doesn't ask us to take just any 
		yoke upon us.&nbsp; He says, Take <i>my </i>yoke upon you.&nbsp; Many of us 
		already feel yoked to our problems, to our addictions, to our 
		weaknesses, to our adversities.&nbsp; Our first reaction may be, The last 
		thing I need is another yoke of any kind.&nbsp; But <i>My </i>yoke?&nbsp; That is 
		another matter indeed.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In our modern, industrialized 
		countries, we don't see many yokes any more.&nbsp; Did you know that each 
		yoke has to be fit to the person using it or the animals that will wear 
		it. Here again is the picture of the woman wearing a yoke.&nbsp; See how it 
		is carved exactly to fit her shoulders and neck. Compare that to this 
		yoke a man is Asia uses to carry goods to and from market.&nbsp; They are 
		very different because the loads are different and the individuals 
		wearing the yokes are different.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Look more carefully at this 
		span of span of oxen yoked together.&nbsp; They are not a perfectly matched 
		pair.&nbsp; Aside from the coloration, the near ox is maybe half a hand span 
		shorter than the other.&nbsp; If you look closely, you can see how the yoke 
		has been carved to accommodate that difference.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If the yoke is 
		not adjusted to the difference between them, when they pull the load, 
		the larger ox will tend to drag the smaller one to some extent.&nbsp; As with 
		people, the yoke has to be tailored to each specific animal. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I love that concept.&nbsp; When I 
		come to the Savior with my burdens, my problems, my challenges, He 
		doesn't hand me an off-the-shelf, one size-fits-all yoke.&nbsp; He knows me 
		intimately.&nbsp; He loves me infinitely.&nbsp; Therefore, the help that He offers 
		me will be perfectly fitted to my needs, my abilities, and my 
		circumstances.&nbsp; How profound are those words. Take <b>my</b> yoke upon 
		you.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The injunction to take His 
		yoke upon us is coupled with another.&nbsp; <b>And learn of me.</b>&nbsp; What 
		does that mean?&nbsp; It is very simple.&nbsp; To learn of Jesus we must be taught 
		by Him.&nbsp; We must receive what He wants us to know. He tells how to do 
		it.&nbsp; First, <b>Come unto me.&nbsp; </b>Second, <b>Take my yoke upon you.&nbsp; </b>
		Third.&nbsp; <b>Learn of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come.&nbsp; Take.&nbsp; Learn. </b>&nbsp;Here is an 
		interesting related concept.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the scriptures, pride is 
		often described as being stiffnecked.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; If we are 
		stiffnecked, we refuse to bow our heads, as we do in prayer, which is a 
		sign of submission. And where does the yoke fit, in both animals and 
		humans.&nbsp; On the neck.&nbsp; As you saw in the picture, to receive the yoke, 
		the oxen have to bow their necks so the yoke can be fitted over their 
		heads.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A condition closely related 
		to stiffneckedness is hardheartedness.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because if we are too 
		proud to bow our heads in submission to God, it is because our hearts 
		are hardened against Him. And when we are stiffnecked and hardhearted, 
		we cannot be taught by the Lord.&nbsp; In the Book of Mormon, one prophet 
		directly tied being stiffnecked to learning by the Spirit. And there 
		are many among us who have many revelations, for they are not all 
		stiffnecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith, have 
		communion with the Holy Spirit (Jarom 1:4).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And another prophet tied 
		revelation directly to the condition of our hearts.&nbsp; Because of 
		meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost 
		(Moroni 8:26) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Before we can learn of Him, 
		we have to humble ourselves, come unto Him, and be willing to take His 
		yoke upon us.&nbsp; <b>Come, take, and learn.&nbsp; </b>It is simple enough, what 
		He asks.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let us move on to our next 
		phrase.&nbsp; <b>For I am meek and lowly of heart.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I was reading this again 
		the other day, one word there suddenly struck me as it never had 
		before.&nbsp; It is the word <i>for.&nbsp; For</i> is a preposition that is used 
		in many different ways.&nbsp; One of those ways is in the same sense as <i>
		because.&nbsp; </i>Here is a sentence that uses <i>for </i>in the sense of 
		because.&nbsp; I felt I had to pay my debt to her, for [or because] it was 
		the right thing to do.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I think that is how the 
		Savior used <i>for </i>in this scripture.&nbsp; Look what happens when we 
		substitute <i>because</i> here:&nbsp; Take my yoke upon you and learn of me
		<i>because </i>I am meek and lowly of heart.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But what does His being meek 
		and lowly of heart have to do with us taking His yoke upon us so we can 
		learn of Him?&nbsp; Let me use a scriptural chain to try and explain what I 
		think He is trying to teach us.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First scripture.&nbsp; In the 
		spring of 1839, Joseph Smith was languishing under the most deplorable 
		of conditions in Liberty Jail.&nbsp; Talk about being heavy laden.&nbsp; His 
		people had just gone through the horrors of Haun's Mill and the fall of 
		Far West.&nbsp; They were driven out of Missouri in the dead of winter, 
		leaving footprints in the snow from bare, bleeding and cracked feet.&nbsp; 
		His own family was among the fleeing refugees.&nbsp; Emma had to cross the 
		Mississippi River on ice, with two children in her arms and two more 
		clinging to her skirts.&nbsp; And all the while Joseph sits helplessly in 
		jail.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that this cry was torn from his lips:&nbsp; O God, 
		where art thou?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is in the Lord's answer to 
		that cry that we gain a marvelous insight about the Savior and His 
		meekness and lowliness of heart.&nbsp; After telling Joseph that even if he 
		should be cast into the hands of murderers and have a sentence of death 
		passed upon him; even if the heavens were to gather blackness and the 
		very jaws of hell should gape open its mouth at him, he should know that 
		all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy 
		good.&nbsp; Then followed a question that has stunning implications for each 
		of us: The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater 
		than he?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Few of us will ever carry a 
		burden equal to what Joseph Smith did, but even Joseph couldn't say to 
		the Lord.&nbsp; You don't understand what I am facing.&nbsp; You don't know how 
		hard this is.&nbsp; If You did, You would take this burden from me.&nbsp; What a 
		humbling concept.&nbsp; There is nothing that we can bring to Christ that He 
		has not personally experienced.&nbsp; There is no sickness, no suffering, no 
		adversity but what He has descended below them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Let me return to my 
		experience as a bishop to help you understand what the Lord is 
		suggesting. My wife and I had been in the ward only about a year, so 
		while we knew who people were, we didn't know them that well.&nbsp; One day I 
		got a call from one of the families in the ward asking if I would come 
		up to the University Hospital and give a blessing to their daughter, 
		Christy.&nbsp; I, of course, said I would be happy to do so, though I had not 
		heard of there being a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I arrived, I was 
		directed to a room on the third floor.&nbsp; As I got off the elevator, I saw 
		a sign indicating this was the center for Cystic Fibrosis.&nbsp; I didn't 
		give it much thought.&nbsp; I had no idea what cystic fibrosis was, nor did I 
		make the connection to Christy.&nbsp; When I walked into the room, however, a 
		shock awaited me.&nbsp; Christy, who was eighteen at the time, was sitting up 
		in her bed.&nbsp; Her mother was standing over her and pounding up and down 
		her back with her fists.&nbsp; Christy held a cup and was coughing up bloody 
		mucus into it.&nbsp; On the hospital tray beside her there were three more 
		cups, all filled with the same bloody mucus.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I learned later that cystic 
		fibrosis is a hereditary disease that causes a fibrous mucus to form in 
		the lungs.&nbsp; Regular thumping on the back helps break up the congestion 
		so the individual can breathe.&nbsp; That was my beginning experience with 
		Christy.&nbsp; Over the next three years I was privileged to come to know her 
		very well.&nbsp; We spent many hours talking together and many blessings were 
		given.&nbsp; She was amazing.&nbsp; She was always cheerful and happy.&nbsp; There was 
		not one iota of resentment in her about this burden which had been 
		laid upon her, or the labor it took for her to stay alive.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">She desperately wanted to 
		serve a mission.&nbsp; It was not to be.&nbsp; She desperately wanted to be a wife 
		and mother.&nbsp; That was not to be either.&nbsp; One day, she asked if it would 
		be possible for her to be endowed in the temple, even though she was 
		single.&nbsp; Happily, the stake president concurred with my recommendation, 
		and I was privileged to be with her and her family when she received 
		that sacred ordinance.&nbsp; And less than a year later, I was honored and 
		deeply humbled when she requested that I speak at her funeral.&nbsp; She died 
		not long after her twenty-first birthday.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I thought about her and 
		her life, I felt guilty.&nbsp; My health has always been good.&nbsp; Why was she 
		given such a handicap?&nbsp; Her life seemed so much purer and more righteous 
		than mine.&nbsp; Yet I got to go on a mission.&nbsp; I got to marry and have a 
		family.&nbsp; I got to run and walk and play without even thinking of the 
		gift of breathing.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I can remember thinking one 
		day that if I were Christy, when I got up to the judgment bar, I would 
		be strongly tempted to step forward and say, It isn't fair.&nbsp; What did I 
		do that I should have been denied these righteous blessings?&nbsp; What did I 
		do that earned me a life of handicap and pain? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And then one day I found the 
		answer.&nbsp; It comes from Alma, and helps explain what the Savior meant 
		when He said that He had descended below all things.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Alma begins by saying, And 
		behold, he shall be born of Mary (Alma 7:10).&nbsp; That is a quick reminder 
		of an important point.&nbsp; Jesus was the Son of God, but He was also the 
		son of Mary.&nbsp; He was born a mortal.&nbsp; He too came into a fallen world.&nbsp; 
		As a baby He was totally dependent on others for His care.&nbsp; He had to 
		eat and drink each day.&nbsp; Even though He had once been a God, now He had 
		to sleep at night.&nbsp; If He hit his thumb in the carpenter shop, it hurt 
		and His thumbnail turned black.&nbsp; In a word, He was one of us.&nbsp; With that 
		established, here is what Alma says next.&nbsp; I have emphasized some key 
		words.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">And 
		he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of 
		every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith <b>he 
		will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people</b>.&nbsp; And 
		he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which 
		bind his people; and <b>he will take upon him their infirmities</b>, 
		that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, <b>
		that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people 
		according to their infirmities</b> (Alma 7:11-12).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here is what Elder Neal A. 
		Maxwell had to say about this passage:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">
		Jesus' daily mortal experiences and His ministry, to be sure, acquainted 
		Him by observation with a sample of human sicknesses, grief, pains, 
		sorrows, and infirmities. . . .But the agonies of the Atonement were 
		infinite and first-hand! Since not all human sorrow and pain is 
		connected to sin, the full intensiveness of the Atonement involved 
		bearing our pains, infirmities, and sicknesses, as well as our sins 
		(Neal A. Maxwell, <i>&quot;Not My Will, But Thine&quot;</i>, p. 51). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Think again of what Joseph 
		was taught in Liberty Jail.&nbsp; The Son of Man hath descended below them 
		all.&nbsp; Elder Maxwell again:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><font color="#000080">
		Can we, even in the depths of disease, tell Him anything at all about 
		suffering? In ways we cannot comprehend, our sicknesses and infirmities 
		were borne by Him even before they were borne by us. . . . .We have 
		never been, nor will we be, in depths such as He has known. Thus His 
		atonement made perfect His empathy and His mercy and His capacity to 
		succor us (Neal A. Maxwell, <i>Even As I Am</i>, pp. 116-17.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That is an astonishing 
		concept.&nbsp; Not only did He make infinite payment for all the wrongs and 
		injustices on earth, but He also gained infinite empathy for each of 
		us.&nbsp; Somehow, in a way that is unfathomable to us, He knows exactly what 
		Christy endured.&nbsp; He knows what it is like to suffer with terminal 
		cancer.&nbsp; He knows the loneliness of depression.&nbsp; He understands the 
		feelings utter hopelessness that can come with some mental illnesses.&nbsp; 
		There is no burden, no sorrow, no suffering that He doesn't fully 
		understand.&nbsp; And because of that, there is nothing we can take to Him 
		that brings a response of, I'm sorry.&nbsp; I don't understand.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Why would He willingly offer 
		Himself as such an infinite sacrifice.&nbsp; It was because He was meek and 
		lowly of heart.&nbsp; He was submissive to the Father.&nbsp; Even in the hour of 
		His darkest need, pleading to escape from the bitter cup that lay ahead, 
		He immediately added these words to His prayer.&nbsp; Nevertheless, not as I 
		will, but as thou wilt (Matthew 26:39).&nbsp; Thus, as Abinadi taught, His 
		will was swallowed up in the will of the Father (see Mosiah 15:7).&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I cannot picture Christy ever 
		demanding to know why life wasn't fair, but if she did, I think I know 
		the answer she would receive.&nbsp; I think the Savior would embrace her and 
		tell her that not only did He understand what she had given up, but that 
		He had paid for it all, that He had made it all right.&nbsp; The blood He 
		shed in Gethsemane and on the cross had paid her debt as well.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear young brothers and 
		sisters, I wish we had time to continue our examination of this 
		profoundly beautiful passage of scripture, but we don't.&nbsp; So I should 
		like to leave you with one other insight.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is a wonderful story in 
		the Book of Mormon about yokes, and burdens and blessings.&nbsp; Before I we 
		talk about that, let me show you a special kind of yoke.&nbsp; This is what 
		in Spanish is called a <i>mecapal.&nbsp; </i>It is a head band used to help 
		an individual carry a heavy load on his or her back.&nbsp; Head bands, or 
		head yokes, are used around the world.&nbsp; This <i>mecapal</i> comes from 
		Gautemala. Here is a dramatic photo of a man in Guatemala using a <i>
		mecapal</i> to bring in wood.&nbsp; I once saw a man in the Old City of 
		Jerusalem carrying a refrigerator on his back, using a woven head band.
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now to the story.&nbsp; Two groups 
		of people fled from the tyranny of King NoahLimhi's people, and the 
		followers of Alma.&nbsp; In both cases they were discovered and placed into 
		bondage by the Lamanites.&nbsp; The people of Limhi had heavy burdens [put] 
		upon their backs, and [they] did drive them as they would a dumb ass (Mosiah 
		21:3).&nbsp; Knowing how old the traditions are in Central America, it is 
		very likely that they used some kind of head band, or <i>mecapal, </i>to 
		carry those burdens<i>.&nbsp; </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the case of Alma's people, 
		we are told that after they were captured, the Lamanites did put tasks 
		upon them, and did put taskmasters over them (Mosiah 24:9).&nbsp; Note that 
		it doesn't say that they were given tasks to do, but that they had tasks 
		put <i>upon</i> them.&nbsp; Again this could suggest they carried burdens on 
		their backs and possibly used head bands to do so. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now let me divert for just a 
		moment to a modern story.&nbsp; Two of my colleagues in the Church 
		Educational System were in the highlands of Guatemala training our 
		seminary teachers.&nbsp; They happened upon a man very much like the one in 
		the picture.&nbsp; He had a large bundle of firewood strapped on his back.&nbsp; 
		They stopped and spoke with him for a time, then one asked if he would 
		mind if they took his picture with the other.&nbsp; He was pleased to do so.&nbsp; 
		As they stood for the photo, the photographer saw that the Guatemalan, 
		who was quite a bit shorter than the America, had his face in shadow.&nbsp; 
		Ask him if he will raise his head a little, he called.<b> </b></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What do you think happened 
		next as this little man raised his head and smiled?&nbsp; That's right, he 
		nearly fell over backwards.&nbsp; With a <i>mecapal</i> you always have to 
		keep your head down, looking at the ground.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Back to Alma and his people.&nbsp; 
		It must have been a terrible time.&nbsp; They were righteous.&nbsp; They had left 
		the life of Noah's court, but as Mormon noted: The Lord seeth fit to 
		chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.&nbsp; 
		Then he added, And none could deliver them but the Lord their God (Mosiah 
		23:21, 23).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Under Alma's leadership, his 
		people were totally submissive to the Lord's will and finally the time 
		came for their deliverance.&nbsp; The Lord said to them: <i>Lift up your 
		heads </i>and be of good comfort. . . .I will covenant with my people 
		and deliver them out of bondage.&nbsp; And I will also <i>ease </i>the 
		burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel 
		them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage, . .that you may 
		know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their 
		afflictions (Mosiah 24:13-14).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What happened when that 
		Guatemalan laborer lifted up his head?&nbsp; To someone carrying a heavy 
		burden on their back, lifting their head is counterintuitive.&nbsp; It is 
		exactly the opposite of what nature requires.&nbsp; And to suggest to someone 
		who carries a heavy burden in life that they lift their heads and look 
		to Savior as a way to lighten their load seems counterintuitive too.&nbsp; 
		But this is His message.&nbsp; Lift up your heads.&nbsp; Look to me.&nbsp; Look up 
		from the endless treadmill of life and see that I am here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Please don't misunderstand, I 
		am not suggesting that those with physical or emotion disabilities turn 
		away from competent medical or clinical care, and just have faith.&nbsp; In 
		my work with the Missionary Department these last two years, I often 
		felt like weeping when I learned of missionaries who stopped taking 
		prescribed medications because they felt like this was how they could 
		demonstrate greater faith.&nbsp; Instead, we had to bring them home until 
		they could be stabilized again.&nbsp; It is important to remember that in 
		this example, the Lord didn't remove their burdens or deliver them from 
		bondage at first, He only eased them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Which brings us to the 
		closing promises of our theme scripture.&nbsp; If we who labor and are heavy 
		laden come unto Him, and if we do so because we understand that His 
		meekness and lowliness of heart brought about the atonement; and if we 
		take His yoke upon us and learn of Him, then the promise is very clear:
		<b>And you shall find rest unto your souls.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here again is the promise of 
		rest, but here we learn that this rest is not just for the body, not 
		just for the mind, but for the soul.&nbsp; The soul is the whole man, the 
		body and the spirit knit together.&nbsp; It is our physical, emotional, 
		mental and spiritual dimensions all wrapped together.&nbsp; What a promise.&nbsp; 
		Ye shall find rest unto you souls.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, I 
		testify that in the Savior Jesus Christ we can find rest to our souls.&nbsp; 
		We can have our burdens lifted.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I testify of the Master who 
		suffered in both body and spirit until He cried out from the cross, It 
		is finished. I testify that He understands our needs, our sorrows, our

<span style="color: #000080">I express my love and appreciation for each

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Let me explain. We are here in mortality

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">How do we get from here to there? There is 
		only one way and that is through Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Only 
		Jesus can get us from here to there. I testify that He came to Earth and 
		in love laid down His life in the great atoning sacrifice which overcame 
		death and sin and makes eternal life possible for us. Cant you hear Him

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Would you please repeat with me the Fourth 
		Article of Faith?&nbsp;&nbsp; You all have the clue that it begins with we 
		believe. So lets start: <i>We believe that the first principles and

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Can you see why&nbsp; Faith in the Lord Jesus 
		Christ is the first principle of the Gospel? That is where everything 
		begins. Our being here on this earth and having the opportunity to grow 
		and progress and return with added joy and glory to live with our Father 
		and Jesus depends on our faith in Jesus Christ. Everything good both 
		here and hereafter, comes from Him. (Moroni 7:12) We all want good 
		things to happen in our lives and in the lives of our loved ones. I know 
		that good things do happen as we have faith and increase that faith, in 
		the Lord Jesus Christ  including the best thing of all- </span></p>

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">I know that Jesus lives and loves us - that 
		He desires with all of His heart to bless us, which He can only do as we 
		are prepared to receive those blessings. Any perceived lack of blessings 
		is never because He is not willing or able, it is because we dont have 
		sufficient faith and thus lack the capacity needed to receive those 
		blessings. How do we increase our faith in Him? There is no other way 
		than to obey. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Faith is not a passive thing, but a vibrant

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">We start where we are and move towards the

<span style="color: #000080">What a promise! Can you feel with me that 
		bursting desire to increase our faith, trust, and confidence in Him,

		do all things.&nbsp; Without it we can do nothing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">One of the main purposes of this great

		If it does that, which I am confident it will, whatever else it does, 
		though valuable, will be of secondary importance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same is true of 
		our being here on this earth.&nbsp; If our experiences here increase our 
		faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, our lives have been worth it no matter 
		how long or short, or filled with mortal challenges they are.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">We increase our trust in Him as we remember

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Think with me back to those eons ago when, 
		as the scriptures tell us, we shouted for joy not only for the 
		opportunity to come to this earth, but for the victory Jesus had won in 
		the great battle in heaven and for His promise to come and help us 
		here.&nbsp; Because a veil has been drawn over our memories, we do not know 
		for sure what challenges we faced there, but we<i> </i>do know that with 
		the Saviors help we overcame those challenges.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Likewise, we do not know for sure what 
		kinds of challenges we will face here, but we do know that with His help

		we succeeded there; with His help we will succeed here! We trusted Him 
		then, let us trust Him now. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Reading the scriptures also helps increase 
		our faith in Him. Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to 
		be there when the Savior walked the earth? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">I will refer to three events from that

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Event #1: A woman who had been ill for many 
		years felt that if she could only touch the hem of the Saviors robe she 
		would be healed. The instant she touched his robe, the Savior perceived 
		that <i>virtue had gone out of Him,</i> and He asked who had touched 
		him. The disciples were incredulous and said: <i>Look at this large 
		thronging crowd, nearly everyone has touched you.</i> But He persisted 
		and soon the woman came forth and said she was the one. Can you feel the 
		Saviors love as he looked into her eyes and tenderly said<b>: <i></i></b><i>Daughter, 
		thy faith hath made thee whole, go in peace.'</i> [Mark 5:34]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Undoubtedly there were other sick people in 
		that crowd  so it was not just touching Him, it was touching Him in 
		Faith. Where would we have been? Where are we now?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Event #2: A blind man cried out as the 
		Savior passed by. The Lord stopped and asked: <i>What wilt thou that I 
		shall do unto thee?&nbsp; And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And 
		Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: Thy faith hath saved thee.</i> 
		[Luke 18:41-42] </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">I am confident that there were other blind

<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Event #3: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">The Savior visited the more righteous 
		Nephites and Lamanites in America. As He looked at them with compassion 
		on them He made this beautiful and thought-provoking statement: <i>I 
		see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you. . . and he did 
		heal them every one.</i> [3 Nephi 17:8]&nbsp; Is our faith sufficient that 
		He can heal us also? We hope we would have gone to Him and been healed 
		as those folks were.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">But think of this question: If we hesitate 
		to go to our Bishop now to be healed, would we really have gone to the 
		Savior then?&nbsp; It took faith to be healed then, it takes faith to be 
		healed today. And remember, physical healing is only a small part of the 
		Saviors healing powers! There is so much we need to be healed from.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">For every challenge there is a solution. 
		The Savior is the only one who completely understands every aspect of 
		our individual challenges, and He is just as anxious to bless us now as 
		He was to bless those people then. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Since He understands everything, His answer 
		may be different from our requests.&nbsp; Remember, Paul had great faith, but 
		after asking three times for relief, his <i>thorn in the flesh</i> 
		remained. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">See if you can identify with some of these 
		challenges: illness, shortage of money, family concerns, lack of dates, 
		school problems, being overweight, feeling under-appreciated, lacking 
		confidence, feeling discouraged, needing to make hard decisions, being 
		single, going through the death of a loved one, being unsure of our 
		faith, experiencing fear or uncertainty about the future, and on and on. 
		Faith in the Savior is the key that opens doors which contain the 
		solution to every conceivable challenge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">It is fine to seek counsel from others, but 
		remember, ultimately it is the Lords counsel that counts. He will not 
		only show us the things we need to do, but will give us the strength and 
		confidence to do them. Each time we overcome a challenge, even a small 
		one, we experience an increase in our faith and confidence to overcome 
		other challenges.&nbsp; That is what growing from strength to strength 
		means.&nbsp; On the other hand, when we let a challenge overcome us, we 
		experience a decrease in faith and confidence. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">How grateful we should be for the Savior 
		who has made it possible that when we make mistakes we can change course 
		&nbsp; called repentance  and through faith in Him be forgiven and get back 
		on the right path.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Another way we increase our faith is found 
		in the 121st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants where the Lord says:
		<i> . . . let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy 
		confidence wax strong in the presence of God . . .</i> (D&amp;C 121:45)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">Jesus is the epitome of virtue, so as we

<span style="color: #000080">Let me demonstrate this principle by using 
		a brief clip from the film The Other Side of Heaven. When I served there

<span style="color: #000080">Recently while visiting with a wonderful

		Then towards the end of his time as stake president, a few young sisters 
		came to him and asked him what went wrong. They had been married in the

		did what you asked, so why has this happened?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: #000080">He prayed a lot about it and finally 
		received this impression: Teach them the importance of Temple Living. As 
		he pondered that thought, he realized that Temple Living is really what 
		the Temple is about. The ordinances, such as Temple Marriage, are vital 
		and should always be taught and emphasized  but the goal for everyone - 
		including these young divorcees, widows, everyone whether married or 
		single, is Temple Living. If we would all make Temple Living our way of

		that you can know that, too. I know that He gives you joy and happiness. 
		To me one of the main reasons for increasing our faith in Him is to 
		better be able to express gratitude and love to Him. Not only for what

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I remember thinking when I

		that very moment, something hit me and I said, No, no, no, please, Im 
		sorry. Leave it as it is. I trust. I trust Thee. I trust thee ways.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have learned for myself

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As our faith and confidence

		know that He is in His temple. I know that He loves you and me. That He

		eternal life. I testify that He is our Lord and Savior, our ever present

		President Monson is Gods mouthpiece on the earth today. I leave my love

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My earliest recollection 
		concerning temple work came when I was a young boy.&nbsp; Some of my friends 
		and I were driven to the Logan Temple to do baptisms for the dead.&nbsp; I 
		dont remember very much about the day, except that it was emphasized we 
		were doing baptisms for some important people.&nbsp; My friend was baptized 
		for a famous man, Cyrus McCormick, who was the inventor of the reaper.&nbsp; 
		Likewise, I remember having the baptism done for the mayor of Boston.&nbsp; 
		This impressed me, and since that time I recall that day whenever I 
		drive by a field of grain and a reaper or combine is harvesting the 
		crop. Cyrus McCormick changed the world with his genius, and we changed 
		his life by offering him an invitation to the Lords kingdom.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I was in college getting 
		ready for my mission, a good friend and I received our recommends and 
		decided to attend the temple to take out our endowments.&nbsp; We didnt 
		realize that family and friends should be invited as well.&nbsp; Upon 
		arriving at the temple, we were asked to participate in an opening 
		devotional, at which both of us were invited to speak.&nbsp; I received a 
		frightening impression that each time you went to the temple you might 
		be asked to talk.&nbsp; That was a wonderful experience and we left the 
		temple that day feeling more grown up, more in tune with our Father in 
		Heaven, and more committed to keep his commandments.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I attended a temple session 
		during my mission in Cardston, Alberta, Canada.&nbsp; I recall on that 
		occasion having a member of the temple presidency tell a very inspiring 
		story. Years before, Brother Edward Wood served as temple president.&nbsp; He 
		was a spiritual man and had unusual experiences.&nbsp; On one occasion he 
		invited a family to participate in a sealing.&nbsp; A mother, father, and 
		some children were present.&nbsp; As he moved to the part of the ceremony 
		where the children were to be sealed, he stopped and asked the parents, 
		Does this sheet contain the names of all your children?&nbsp; The parents 
		replied that it did.&nbsp; He moved again to that point where the children 
		were to be sealed and asked the question, Are you sure all the names of 
		your children are on this list?&nbsp; A third time he stopped and asked the 
		same question.&nbsp; With that, the parents took the list, reflected back and 
		realized that they had left off the name of a child who died at birth.&nbsp; 
		The name was added and the ceremony continued to its completion.&nbsp; 
		Afterward, President Wood indicated that as he arrived at the moment 
		when the sealing was to take place with the children, a voice came to 
		him each time which said, Dont forget me.&nbsp; Once the named was added 
		to the list, the sealing was completed and the voice was not heard 
		again.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was in a conference a few 
		years ago and shared that experience. &nbsp;Afterward, a woman came to the 
		stand to say that she was a missionary in Canada, and the family to 
		which I referred was one of her contact families that she helped 
		reactivate.&nbsp; She was in the temple and witnessed that experience and 
		confirmed that the Lord did prompt President Wood to ensure the family 
		was totally sealed together.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In our family we have had a 
		tradition of temple work.&nbsp; I think part of that comes from the 
		delightful story that is told of my relative, Thomas G. Lowe, of 
		Franklin, Idaho.&nbsp; Brother Lowe was asked to prepare the gold balls that 
		now sit at the top of the Logan Temple.&nbsp; They were to be 36 inches in 
		diameter.&nbsp; In order to prepare them, he nailed planks into a cube, and 
		then using a chisel and hammer he whittled down the wood to the 36 inch 
		diameter.&nbsp; On the ball that sits at the west end of the temple, he 
		worked for many days until he got the ball to 38 inches.&nbsp; It was almost 
		impossible to bring it down to the size specified.&nbsp; He called to Brother 
		Angel, the architect, and asked if he must do the work according to the 
		drawing.&nbsp; Brother Angel confirmed the fact that the ball must be 36 
		inches.&nbsp; When the architect was out of sight, Brother Lowe went to the 
		top of the temple and placed the ball, even though it was two inches too 
		large.&nbsp; The second ball that sits at the east end of the temple was 
		whittled down to 36 inches.&nbsp; He then went to Brother Angel after some 
		days and said, I finally finished my job.&nbsp; How does it look now?&nbsp; 
		Brother Angel looked up to say, Its fine.&nbsp; It always pays to build 
		like the architect says.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">While putting the second ball 
		in place, Brother Lowe fell off the north side and it took 20 minutes to 
		get a ladder to him.&nbsp; His fingers were stiff for awhile but there was no 
		other problem associated with the near-fatal fall.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These stories, along with 
		many other experiences, have drawn me closer to the temple over the 
		years.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Temple building in the 
		latter-days began in Kirkland, Ohio.&nbsp; On&nbsp; April 3, 1836,&nbsp; a week after 
		the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, a sacrament meeting was held in 
		the Temple.&nbsp; The Prophet described that afternoon in these simple terms: 
		In the afternoon I assisted the other presidents in distributing the 
		Lords Supper to the Church, receiving it from the Twelve whose 
		privilege it was to officiate the sacred task this day.&nbsp; After having 
		performed this service to my brethren, I retired to the pulpit, the 
		veils being dropped, and bowed myself, with Oliver Cowdry in solemn and 
		silent prayer.&nbsp; It was on this occasion that a beautiful revelation was 
		given of the Savior, contained in Section 110 of the Doctrine and 
		Covenants. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding 
		were opened.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">We 
		saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and 
		under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like 
		the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; 
		and his voice was as the sound of rushing of great waters, even the 
		voice of Jehovah, saying:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I 
		am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I 
		am your advocate with the Father. (D&amp;C 110:1-4)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: .5in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many prophets from the 
		beginning of time attempted to describe the physical characteristics of 
		the Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This description is probably the most 
		inspiring of them all.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Kirkland Temple stands as 
		a symbol to members of the Church, for it was in this temple that Moses 
		and Elijah appeared.&nbsp; The prophet received a vision of the celestial 
		kingdom where his brother Alvin was shown to him.&nbsp; Much of the early 
		beginning of the Church and some of the great revelation had their 
		origin in this temple and in the Kirkland area.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we think about temple 
		work, the focus is on those ancestors who cannot do the work 
		themselves.&nbsp; But the great blessing of participating in the temple 
		ordinances and receiving your endowment comes to those who are living.&nbsp; 
		A beautiful prayer was offered at the dedication of the temple in which 
		Joseph Smith outlined a number of the blessings that come to people who 
		attend regularly.&nbsp; Section 109 of the Doctrine and Covenants outlines 
		these blessings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here is a summary of the 
		blessings for those who attend the temple regularly:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">
<font color="#000080">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will receive a fullness of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We are now blessed to have a 
		beautiful temple here in Rexburg, serving the needs of the saints in the 
		upper Snake River Valley and the faithful students at BYUI.&nbsp; I recently 
		wrote an article about the temple for the BYUI magazine Perspective, 
		which provides a public forum on many topics.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I noted that most of my 
		professional life took place in Logan, Utah, where I worked as an 
		administrator at Utah State University.&nbsp; Ruth Ann and I enjoyed the 
		benefits of working in a university atmosphere among lively and 
		dedicated students.&nbsp; The call to serve the Lord in Rexburg seemed quite 
		natural in many ways.&nbsp; After arriving here, I was pleased to learn that 
		the pioneers who settled this area also came from Cache Valley.&nbsp; Early 
		settlers, such as Thomas E. Ricks, William F. Rigby, Francis Gunnell, 
		Fred Smith and others moved from Logan in the late 1800s.&nbsp; The weather 
		and college atmosphere in Rexburg and Logan are similar.&nbsp; Having 
		traveled to the area many times over the years to visit the campus and 
		family members allowed us to be comfortable with the assignment to serve 
		the Lord for a few years in the lovely upper Snake River Valley. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This beautiful valley reminds 
		me of the words from Deuteronomy 8:7-9: A land of wheat, and barley and 
		vinesA land of honeyA land wherein thou shalt eat bread without 
		scarcenessThou shalt not lack anything in it.&nbsp; This was confirmed to 
		me with the comments of Don C. Driggs who in 1888 offered these words as 
		he viewed the Teton Valley:&nbsp; I shall never forget our reaching the 
		summit beyond Canyon Creek where we could look into the valley (Teton 
		Valley) .&nbsp; The vision we beheld was overpowering.&nbsp; Indeed, it looked 
		like the promised land.&nbsp; His thoughts were reinforced years later by 
		Hyrum Manwaring, the 7<sup>th</sup> president of Ricks College who 
		offered these observations:&nbsp;&nbsp; On the evening of July 23<sup>rd</sup>, I 
		came to Rexburg to deliver the oration at the 24<sup>th</sup> of July 
		celebrationRicks Academy seemed nothing but a massive stone building 
		standing in the center of a rugged ten acre plot of ground (with) 
		sagebrush and lava rockI stood lonely and very depressed and silently 
		shed tears to think I was bringing my dear wife and children to this 
		place to try to make a home.&nbsp; I climbed further up the slope and looked 
		farther over the great valley; I suddenly seemed to catch the spirit of 
		the pioneers, and to dream of the great potentials that lay before me.&nbsp; 
		I saw the future of a fine residential city and a great college.&nbsp; Later 
		that morning when I went to the new tabernacle to deliver my speechI 
		was inspired as I have seldom been and made a speech that was full of 
		hope and enthusiasm.&nbsp; As I gave courage and determination to my eager 
		listeners, I received ten fold of &nbsp;that spirit for myself.&nbsp; I finished 
		that day full of the </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">old pioneer spirit that 
		builds empires.&nbsp; I left Rexburg happy.I felt that I had found a 
		challenge for my young mind, heart, and muscles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What makes this place 
		productive and beautiful are the faithful saints and their wonderful 
		neighbors.&nbsp; I think, Alma, when speaking to the saints in Gidion, may 
		have been referring also to the dedicated members in this valley:&nbsp; For 
		I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness:&nbsp; I perceive that 
		ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive 
		that ye are making his paths straight. (Alma 7:19).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Idaho has another gem to 
		compete with Old Faithful for the most photographed location in the 
		area.&nbsp; There were a number of predictions that many temples would come 
		to the area.&nbsp; In an address delivered by President J. Reuben Clark at 
		the ceremony marking the laying of the cornerstone and dedication of the 
		Idaho Falls Temple, October 9, 1940, he stated, This is the first 
		temple in Idaho, but as surely as we are here we shall build other 
		temples in Idaho.&nbsp; (Idaho Falls: 1945, Boise: 1984; Rexburg and Twin 
		Falls; 2008)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It was on September 30, 1949, 
		that Mayor J. M. Parkinson and city clerk Loretta M. Rigby verified the 
		sale of this land on which the temple is located.&nbsp; The purchased price 
		was $5500.&nbsp; The land was used for many years to raise farm crops.&nbsp; There 
		were always a hope and prayer that it might be used some day as the site 
		for a temple.&nbsp; When President Hinckley announced that a temple would be 
		built in Rexburg, many saints rejoiced to know that it would sit on this 
		prominent spot in the city, next to the campus of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; It is 
		viewed from at least 10 miles away in every direction, especially at 
		night.&nbsp; President Boyd K. Packer provides a perfect description for the 
		temple: The temple itself becomes a symbol.&nbsp; If you have seen one of 
		the temples at night, fully lighted, you know what an impressive sight 
		that can be.&nbsp; The house of the Lord, bathed in the light, standing out 
		in the darkness, becomes symbolic of the power and inspiration of the 
		gospel of Jesus Christ standing as a beacon in a world that sinks ever 
		further into spiritual darkness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The process of opening the 
		temple in Rexburg has been a humbling experience.&nbsp; Over the past few 
		months, at least 1500 members have been interviewed, called and many 
		have been set apart to serve as temple workers.&nbsp; Everyone accepted the 
		invitation to serve with faith and devotion.&nbsp; The response to the Open 
		House and dedication was impressive.&nbsp; The thousands of volunteers who 
		assisted with these events brought much appreciation and admiration from 
		leaders.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There was an early plan to 
		build a large temple in Rexburg, but to operate it with a small temple 
		philosophy.&nbsp; We were authorized to have a small professional staff to 
		supervise key functions, such as recoding, engineering and custodial 
		duties.&nbsp; The majority of the temple workers would be volunteers, called 
		from the local wards and stakes.&nbsp; The saints in the area have responded 
		to the call to serve in the temple.&nbsp; Many are giving numerous hours of 
		their personal lives to ensure that the temple operates with efficiency 
		and success.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At the Logan Temple 
		cornerstone dedication, President George Q. Cannon made this statement:&nbsp; 
		Every foundation stone that is laid for a Temple and every Temple 
		completed according to the order the Lord has revealed for his holy 
		Priesthood lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the 
		power of God and godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our 
		behalf, invokes and calls down upon us the blessings of the Eternal Gods 
		and those who reside in their presence.: (Millennial Star, 12 Nov. 1877, 
		p. 743).&nbsp; Already we note the fulfillment of that promise as the saints 
		come to the temple in large numbers.&nbsp; The youth occupy the baptistry 
		from 6:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m.&nbsp; Families are sealed for eternity, and 
		couples are enjoying the blessings of eternal marriages.&nbsp; The work for 
		the dead remains a high priority for the members.&nbsp; Enthusiasm for the 
		temple and its saving ordinances is bringing patrons to the temple in 
		large numbers, &nbsp;and we believe the spirituality of the members is 
		enhanced among the wards and stakes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The temple brings peace and 
		joy to those who attend.&nbsp; From the helpful pamphlet, Preparing to Enter 
		the Temple we read:&nbsp; Sometimes our minds are beset with problems, and 
		there are so many things clamoring for attention at once that we just 
		cannot think clearly and see clearly.&nbsp; At the temple the dust of 
		distractions seems to settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift and 
		we can see things that we were not able to see before and find a way 
		through our troubles that we had not previously known. &nbsp;(Preparing to 
		Enter the Holy Temple (2202), 56).&nbsp; I watch as couples enter the temple 
		for proxy endowment sessions.&nbsp; Many of them are in a rush because they 
		are late.&nbsp; Others reflect frustration with each other.&nbsp; Many bring the 
		activities and difficulties of a busy life at work and home still in 
		their minds.&nbsp; It is a joy to watch these same couples leave the 
		Celestial room after a session at the temple.&nbsp; They often hold hands and 
		reflect an obvious love for each other.&nbsp; The frustrations have subsided, 
		and they return home with more determination to love their family and to 
		serve the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As they walk together out of 
		the temple, Im reminded of President Gordon B. Hinckleys thoughts: 
		Can anyone believing in eternal life doubt that the God of Heaven would 
		grant his sons and daughters that most precious attribute of life, the 
		love that finds its most meaningful expression in family relationships?&nbsp; 
		No, reason demands that the family relationship shall continue after 
		death.&nbsp; The human heart longs for it, and the God of Heaven has revealed 
		a way whereby it may be secured.&nbsp; The sacred ordinances of the house of 
		the Lord provide for it. (Why These Temples?  Temples of the Church 
		of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1999), 17).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I invite everyone to come to 
		the temple.&nbsp; Its beauty draws attention to the spiritual influence it 
		will have in this valley.&nbsp; The words of the lord to the saints at the&nbsp; 
		dedication of the Kirkland Temple have application here:&nbsp; And the fame 
		of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning 
		of the blessings which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people. 
		(D&amp;C 110:10)&nbsp; This is especially true for the saints who live in the 
		upper Snake River Valley.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What can we do to show our 
		love to God for giving us the glorious blessing of having a temple in 
		Rexburg? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">1. 
		We can return often to the temple to provide the same blessing for 
		someone else.&nbsp; This is a selfless service since the person cannot even 
		say thanks for the work you provide.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">2. 
		We can return often to seek a sense of peacefulness, quietude and 
		serenity.&nbsp; Its in the temple that you put aside all the cares of the 
		world and take time to reflect upon Gods blessing and to feel His 
		spirit and to receive answers to your prayers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">3. 
		We can return often to seek a more clear meaning of the message.&nbsp; What 
		do the symbols means?&nbsp; What new insight can I gain?&nbsp; Not every time I 
		attend do I receive additional inspiration, but there have been a few 
		sessions where new thoughts about Gods love have come as I more 
		completely understood what was being said through the symbolic reference 
		to our Heavenly Fathers work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">4. 
		We can pledge again an obedience to covenants and to the gospel of Jesus 
		Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">5. 
		We can enjoy the wonderful feeling of love and support received from the 
		presidency and the workers in the temple. A few days ago I counted at 
		least 15 people who greeted me warmly before I sat down to prepare for 
		the temple session.&nbsp; Most people go all week long at their work or other 
		places without having 15 people greet them warmly.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Boyd K. Packer said 
		this about temple work: The ordinances and ceremonies of the temple are 
		simple.&nbsp; They are beautiful.&nbsp; They are sacred.&nbsp; They are kept 
		confidential least they be given to those who are unprepared.&nbsp; Curiosity 
		is not a preparation.&nbsp; Deep interest is not a preparation.&nbsp; Preparation 
		for the ordinances includes preliminary steps:&nbsp; faith, repentance, 
		baptism, confirmation, worthiness, maturity and dignity worthy of one 
		who comes invited as a guest into the House of the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is my prayer that we may 
		all understand the importance and the beauty of &nbsp;Latter-day Saint temple 
		work.&nbsp; Again, it is not a blessing that comes just to those who have 
		gone before.&nbsp; But it is primarily a blessing provided for those who are 
		living.&nbsp; Return often to the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 109, to 
		read the promised blessings.&nbsp; This will motivate all of us to return to 
		the temple as often as possible in order to receive those great 
		blessings in our lives.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is an honor to serve the 
		Lord in the Rexburg Idaho Temple.&nbsp; The faithful saints in the valley are 
		enjoying the spiritual growth that comes from participating in the 
		ordinances provided in the house of the Lord.&nbsp; The Lord is pleased with 
		the overwhelming response from the saints as they visit the temple in 
		large numbers.&nbsp; There is every indication that the members will continue 
		to be blessed by the Lord.&nbsp; May the Lord open the way for you to visit 
		His Holy House often.&nbsp; I offer my testimony that temple work is 
		uplifting and divine.&nbsp; May the Lord bless you to obtain your own witness 
		of this inspired work, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </font>

		Good afternoon brothers and sisters. It is an honor to be with you today 
		I feel overwhelmed with humility in being asked to speak to you over

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		One winter day a few years ago, I was getting out of the SUV I drive to 
		accommodate my six children. Now, SUVs are large and there was a decent 
		first step from the car door to the frosty ground below. I slid across 
		the seat, shifting all of my weight onto the supporting leg. Oblivious 
		to the glossy sheen below me, my foot made contact with the icy surface, 
		and the ground began to move. I tried digging in with my heels in an 
		effort to unearth enough traction to prevent a stumbling fall on the 
		polished city street, but before I knew it, I was treating the 
		spectators around me with a delightful rendition of the crazy leg dance; 
		you know the one, where you dramatically shuffle in place and swing your 
		arms with an odd expression of anxiety on your face. You look absolutely 
		ridiculous until gravity prevails, control is lost, and you find 
		yourself on the ground, void of any remaining dignity. Now while this 
		was happening, I was laughing uncontrollably, which made it even harder 
		to maintain my balance or plan for a graceful landing. In addition, to 
		provide the perfect climactic ending, I had stopped by Jamba Juice on 
		the way to work to pick up a smoothie, and well, you can see where this 
		is going. As my weight veered back, my arms were thrown forward 
		instinctively which released the full force of the smoothie into the 
		air. As I landed face up I could see my Orange Sunrise smoothie, filled 
		with fruit and cream and topped off with an immunity boost, orbiting 
		through the sky above me. As quickly as it happened the performance was 
		over and I lay in the parking lot covered in my breakfast and laughing 
		to myself thinking, boy I wish one of those people watching me had a 
		video camera. </span></font></p>

		Once again I am grateful for the experiences of my childhood and the

		cone machine. When they came home with this glorious invention and 
		plugged it in, my family and I watched with anticipation as the ice was

		salivate as I thought to myself, Snow cones anytime we want. Mom and 
		dad youre the best!! That was before I realized there was a catch. Not 
		only would we be eating the snow cones, we would be selling them to. Now 
		let me paint a picture for you. Imagine the summer months in Mesa, 
		Arizona. On average the temperature would rise to 110 degrees. My 
		siblings and I mounted a three wheeled bike with a large basket attached 
		in the back, a cooler filled with crushed ice, the stickiest syrup you 
		can imagine, oh, and dont forget a whistle to blow to let everyone know 
		we were coming. We were told to head to the ball fields, where we spent 
		many hours in the hot sun selling these snow cones. Today they have 
		child labor laws, but back them I think the motto was, Anything that 
		doesnt kill them will make them stronger. This experience taught me to 
		work and work hard. It made every subsequent job seem like a piece a 
		cake. NO job was beneath me, as long as it was in an air- conditioned 
		room. It instilled a work habit that enabled me to assist in supporting 
		my family especially during those early years of marriage when the jobs

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As President Clark mentioned, 
		Jill and I had the sweet opportunity to be deeply involved in many of 
		the events leading up to the dedication and opening of the Rexburg 
		Temple. During the open house, over 206,000 visitors toured our 
		beautiful temple. When mid January arrived, the students of BYUIdaho 
		returned from Christmas break. Engrained upon my memory forever will be 
		the great excitement and reverent spirit which I witnessed as thousands 
		and thousands of you came for a glimpse of the temple. Many of you came, 
		arm in arm, time and time again. It was as though you felt at home 
		there. I thank you for that sweet memory.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am so glad Jill is here 
		today. We met some 30 years ago here upon the campus of BYUIdaho, then 
		Ricks College. It was a blind date. I remember going to pick her up. It 
		was apartment #22 of Hillcrest Apartments, then called Mansard Village. 
		Jill answered the door. I remember how beautiful she was, her wonderful 
		smile and sparkle in her eyes. I hoped that this was indeed Jill Anstead. 
		I told her I was Richard and that I was here to pick up Jill. She 
		sweetly smiled, looked me straight in the eye and told me that Jill had 
		left 15 minutes ago. Luckily her roommates started laughing in the 
		background. That day, I received the first taste of her unique sense of 
		humor. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">She is my friend  my best 
		friend  I am so thankful that our paths crossed here at Ricks College 
		so many years ago. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, the 
		reason I share these accounts with you, is that years from know, it will 
		be times like these at BYUIdaho which you will remember. It will be of 
		being in the temple, going to Church, walking through campus on a sunny 
		fall day. It will be your relationships with roommates, ward members, 
		faculty and those you date. These very personal experiences will be the 
		source of fond and rich memories which you will draw on in years to 
		come. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Today, I wish to speak of 
		friends  and brief acquaintances  and the powerful impact they have 
		upon us and we upon them. As I do this, I would like to share a couple 
		of scriptures with you which will lay a foundation for what I have to 
		share.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our Savior, Jesus Christ,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the 25<sup>th</sup> 
		chapter of Matthew, the Savior describes an event that will take place 
		at His coming as he returns to the earth. I love these verses and 
		perhaps I may take this account too literally. It begins in the 31<sup>st</sup> 
		verse and describes that when the Savior returns to the earth with His 
		holy angels He shall sit upon his throne. He will gather the inhabitants 
		of all nations before Him and will separate them. Some on His right and 
		some on His left. To those on his right, verse 34 reads:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-left: 1.0in">

<span style="color: #000080">35</span><font color="#000080"> For I was

		Somewhat confused, those gathered on His right hand respond by saying, 
		Lord, we do not remember. We do not remember a time when we saw thee an

		you as a stranger and took thee in? or naked and clothed thee? Or sick 
		or in prison and came unto thee? Then in verse 40 the defining remark of 
		the Savior as to how important we all are to Him:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To the Savior, the poor, the

		all are individually important to the Savior. So special are we to Him,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, always

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In that regard, I wish to 
		share with you a letter which I received while I was serving in the BYUIdaho 
		First Stake. It was a letter from the mother of a young man sent to his 
		bishop in our stake. It was received during the week we were about to 
		call a new bishop. With the permission of this mother, I will share some 
		of her thoughts about her son. I will not refer to him by his real name, 
		but today we will call him Wilbur.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Dear Bishop,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I 
		am writing in hopes of receiving whatever help you might be able to give 
		me in regards to my son, Wilbur who is presently in your ward at BYUIdaho.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I 
		have prayed and fasted for guidance and thought to write to you in case 
		you might know how to reach him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">His 
		dad and I spoke to him on the phone last night at which time he informed 
		us that he is coming home at the end of the semester. He has planned to 
		try to live with friends so that he can get away from the influence of 
		the Church in his life. He says that he has prayed several times to know 
		if the gospel is true and claims he has never received an answer. So 
		now, he says, I give up. Im not going to try anymore. He says it is 
		misery to be around so many people there at school who say they know it 
		is true and that their prayers are answered while his are not. 
		Therefore, he says, he is rejecting it all.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Bishop, Wilbur has been struggling with this for several years. Somehow 
		he is unable to recognize the still small voice and perhaps expects a 
		lightning bolt or a vision. He has made some mistakes in his life . . . 
		hanging around hard rock musicians who put no pressure on him to try to 
		better himself and who are therefore, easy to hang out with because 
		they have no expectations of him. Whereas, he feels that to be a 
		faithful member of the Church requires so much obligation, more than he 
		can stand without a testimony.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Though rebellious, we know our beloved son is valuable and that his soul 
		is of great worth to the Lord. We love him tremendously and know that 
		the Lord would not have us give up on him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">If 
		there is anything you can do to reach my sons heart or to help him with 
		this struggle of faith, I would be eternally grateful.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I mentioned, the Bishop 
		handed me the letter near the day of his release. I immediately tried to 
		contact this young man and found that he had checked out of school early 
		and returned home. I called his mother to see what might be done  to 
		see if there was something we might do to help him return. Wilbur had 
		moved on, joining those who had little expectations of him</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Later I contacted his mother 
		to see how Wilbur was doing. During the conversation, she shared with me 
		that she felt that things could have been so different if Wilbur had 
		simply chosen to associate with different types of friends in his life  
		good friends as she described them. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have thought a lot about 
		that comment since then and about some of the comments the mother had 
		written in her letter. Might I point two observations which this very 
		insightful mother suggested would have been of great benefit to her son:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Wilbur needed to be with 
			those who genuinely cared about him. Unlike Wilburs friends 
			mentioned in his mothers letter, friends who truly care do have 
			expectations of us. Expectations which are not critical or intended 
			to be overwhelming or burdensome; but a simple assumption that <i>
<b>the best we can be is really who we are. </b></i>Associating with 
			those who expect little or nothing from us usually results in our 
			actions yielding just that  very little. On the other hand, as we 
			associate with those who recognize our potential, our true 
			character, our tender heart; their association instills in us a 
			desire to live according to our highest potential. We come to 
			realize, as they do, that the best we can be really is who we are.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Wilbur needed to be around people who not 
			only bear their testimony in Sacrament Meeting but actually lived 
			their testimony through their actions, their selfless deeds of 
			service and kind gestures. Through such examples, good friends 
			provide us with occasional snap shots of what it means to be 
			Christ-like. As we witness such qualities in others, the Spirit of 
			the Holy Ghost whispers to us that these qualities are genuine, 
			lasting, good and virtuous. We find ourselves wanting to incorporate 
			those qualities into our lives. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Because Wilbur, while here, 
		chose not to heed the promptings of the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, 
		Wilburs mother had prayed earnestly that his path would cross with 
		those who could provide an example, with those who could touch his 
		heart, with those willing and worthy to be instruments in our Father in 
		Heavens hand to deliver the message that God is mindful of him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Spencer W. Kimball 
		once remarked:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through 
		another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we 
		serve each other . . . In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read about how 
		important it is to succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, 
		and strengthen the feeble knees. (81:5) So often our acts of service 
		consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane 
		tasks  but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and 
		from small but deliberate deeds.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-left: 2.0in">
<font color="#000080">- President Spencer W. Kimball, Small Acts of 
		Service, Ensign, Dec 1974, 5</font></p>

<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In February of 2001, our 
		family was with a group who had the opportunity to spend the afternoon 
		with President Monson as we were hosting him to speak at a CES broadcast 
		originating from this campus. During the course of the afternoon, we 
		listened to him tell story after story about his life  about what he 
		does every day. Each story had one thing in common. Every account was 
		about service to others, not in terms of speaking to congregations of 
		thousands of people, but of individual acts by him or by others he knew 
		who had reached out to lift another. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we were preparing to leave 
		for the fireside, someone asked the final question: What one piece of 
		advice would you have for us as we part? I will never forget what he 
		said :. He contemplated for a moment then he remarked, Always remember, 
		You never know whose angel youre suppose to be.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I look at all of you, I 
		see angels. Angels in waiting. Waiting for the right moment to assist 
		our Father in lifting and helping one of His children who is in need. As 
		Elder Jeffrey R. Holland remarked in conference a few weeks ago,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">. . 
		. when we speak of those who are instruments in the hand of God, we are 
		reminded that not all angels are from the other side of the veil. Some 
		of them we walk with and talk withhere, now, every day.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I want you to think with me 
		for a moment and review our experiences of the past week. Please recall 
		fleeting thoughts of those we encounter. Our thoughts might range from a 
		warm smile at the shear thought or site of someone we really like to be 
		around, to; boy, I would really like to meet him or her, [perhaps he 
		is my eternal companion] to; there is that girl in our ward who has had 
		that tragic loss in her life, this time must be so difficult for her 
		to; Hmm . . . there is that young man again. I keep seeing him around 
		campus. He is always so very quiet and reserved. His spirit and 
		countenance doesnt seem to be smiling today, I wonder if something is 
		wrong? I wonder if there is anything I can do? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we encounter others and 
		witness our response, I would suggest that many of your impressions are 
		very subtle yet very distinct promptings of the Spirit of the Holy Ghost 
		to do something. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you are like me, when I 
		was in college, as I encountered someone who I was not familiar with or 
		not comfortable in approaching, often I would shrink from the 
		opportunity, moving on in my own busy life  afraid to put myself at 
		risk. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, there 
		is a better approach. To quote my daughter Dani, we need to put 
		ourselves out there What she means is to take the bold step to place 
		ourselves directly in the path of someone who needs us. Someone who we 
		are prompted to help. What she means is that we need to be deeply 
		engaged in the business of being angels  instruments in our Father in 
		Heavens hand to assist Him in delivering intended blessings to His 
		children.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As I prepared my remarks for 
		today, I again called Wilburs mother. I guess I was sort of surprised 
		that 6 years later she still had the same telephone number and that she 
		remembered who I was. She reported that although Wilbur had not yet 
		returned into full activity in the Church, that he was making great 
		progress. She expressed deep gratitude for BYUIdaho and the students, 
		ward members, faculty and priesthood leaders that are here. Given that 
		he hadnt had a very good experience here, I wondered why she had such 
		gratitude for this place? During our conversation, the answer became 
		clear. Because, as she said, he remembers. He remembers the associations 
		 although very brief  which he had while he was here. He remembers the 
		example of the people here. <i><b>He remembers their testimonies. </b>
</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">She said her prayers, unknown 
		to her at the time, had been answered. You see, Wilbur had been touched 
		by some wonderful caring angels while here at BYUIdaho. I am sure some 
		of them didnt even know it at the time, but they touched his heart 
		through their example. Even though he rejected them while he was here, 
		now he remembers. Six years later, he is now beginning to recognize the 
		influence for good which was here. As we were saying goodbye, she 
		remarked My prayers were answered before and I have faith they will be 
		answered again. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, you are 
		here gaining a wonderful education which will help you become a 
		productive, contributing member of society. Never lose sight of how 
		important it is while you are here  and always  to be constantly 
		learning how to become an angel. Angels on earth, instruments in the 
		hand of our Father in Heaven in helping him deliver intended blessings 
		to his children.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In closing, I would like to 
		read counsel given by President Gordon B. Hinckley to a group of 
		students in similar circumstances to yours. In a commencement address at 
		the University of Utah in 1998 he said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I 
		commend you on your accomplishments this day. I wish for you great 
		success in your chosen fields. I can only hope for you that yours may be 
		the rich and satisfying pleasure of going beyond your regular vocational 
		pursuits and pausing to do that which will help in some way someone in 
		distress to raise his or her eyes and look up to you and say, Thank 
		you. Thank you, for what you did for me.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">It

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is a bit intimidating to 
		be asked to speak at devotional. However, I know you are faithful young 
		people who are here listening because you want to live and do what the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In October general 
		conference, I had a distinct impression that we need to prepare now for 
		what is to come, so I want to visit with you about what may lie ahead in 
		for us this life. The Lord has said, To everything there is a season 
		and a time to every purpose under the heaven.<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup> 
		He has also admonished us to Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; 
		and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge 
		him and he shall direct thy paths.<sup><font size="1">2</font></sup> 
		Finally he has told us If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.<sup><font size="1">3</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am reminded of a story 
		retold by President Howard W. Hunter:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">It told of the less-than-spectacular career of a 
		quarterback on the football team of a small, rural high school. This 
		young man managed to make the team, but it was clear he was not going to 
		be all-state or all-American. Indeed, it didnt look like he was going 
		to be all-anything, except perhaps all battered and bruised. He was the 
		fourth of the four quarterbacks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">By seasons end he had never been called into a 
		game and had given up hope. During the final game of the year he pulled 
		off his shoes, wrapped himself in a blanket, and settled down on the 
		bench to watch his buddies play.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Midway through the game he heard the coach shout 
		his name. He was startled and wondered if he had been mistaken. Then it 
		came again, right from the coachs lips, Hey, you! Get in there and 
		move the ball!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">What should he do? His first impulse was to lapse 
		into a coma. His second was to pretend he didnt hear. His third was to 
		say, Wait, coach. Wait while I put on my shoes. He did the only manly 
		thing. Strapping on his helmet as he ran, he made straight for the 
		huddle; his white-stockinged feet were conspicuous to the players on 
		both teams, as well as to the spectators and the coach, who also must 
		have been ready to lapse into a coma.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">He called the play, but the shock of his first 
		game was obviously a little disconcerting. By the time he took the snap 
		from center he had forgotten the play he had called. His teammates moved 
		to the right, but he gamely went left. There, alone against the world, 
		he met the opposition head-on and was swallowed up in the snarl of the 
		onrushing linemen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">He said later, No one expected me to make a 
		touchdown. Even running the wrong way was understandable. But there was 
		no excuse for a quarterback without shoes.<sup><font size="1">4</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have felt impressed to talk 
		about preparing for what may be ahead for each of us on our road of 
		life. The challenge is that none of us can see far down the road. We can 
		choose the road that we start on but we cannot see where it leads. In 
		addition, there are detours in our road of life that sometimes force us 
		to choose a different path for a while. There are also forks in the road 
		that allow us to take different paths than the one we began on. I 
		believe that if we move forward with the right tools, we will be 
		successful on the paths our lives take, whatever those paths may be.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I would first like to visit 
		with you about some of the possibilities that lie ahead and then give 
		you some tools to take along so that you can take full advantage of the 
		opportunities that will come to you. All of you are here at school for a 
		purpose. Many of you have specific goals in mind and you are working to 
		achieve those goals. We need to have goals and we need to pursue those 
		goals. As you move ahead in life you will have to make choices as to 
		whether to change those goals and pursue other endeavors temporarily or 
		long term. Success in life is not necessarily determined by whether or 
		not we reach every goal we set. Most of you have heard the poem entitled 
		The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">Two

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">And

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">And 
		be one traveler, long I stood</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">And

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">To

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">And

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">I

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">And

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Unexpected opportunities will 
		come to each of us as we move down the road of life. The question is, 
		What will we do when we are faced with those opportunities? Sometimes 
		those opportunities come to us as invitations from the Lord to serve 
		others in unexpected ways. We must not only be prepared to recognize 
		those invitations but we must be prepared so we have the ability to make 
		a choice when those opportunities do come. Some of the choices we make 
		will bring worldly recognition and some choices will bring no 
		recognition at all from our fellow men. Opportunities to choose will 
		also come at times when we least expect them. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There will also be times in 
		our lives when we may not get to choose the road we travel for a time. 
		An example would be losing a job. But the opportunities for choice will 
		return, sometimes quicker than we expect and those opportunities may 
		come from unexpected directions. Remember  when the door of opportunity 
		appears, the chance for preparation is past.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another possibility on our 
		road is that Satan will try to put roadblocks up to divert us from the 
		path we should be following. Again, we must be able to recognize those 
		and have the tools to go around those roadblocks and stay on the road we 
		should be traveling. We live in the last days and the rate at which 
		things are happening will continue to increase. The work of the Lord 
		will move forward at an accelerating pace as will Satans attempt at 
		derailing or diverting us from that work. Satans distractions may not 
		come in the form of discouragement but in the form of worldly 
		recognition. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So the question is How do we 
		face this life of unknowns, with forks in the road and roadblocks and 
		sometimes transfers to roads we do not choose and still move ahead and 
		be contributors to the work of the Lord and to each other? First, Do 
		not pray for tasks equal to your abilities but pray for abilities equal 
		to your tasks.<sup><font size="1">6</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Preparation is essential, 
		living worthy of the spirit is essential but having every skill for 
		every responsibility and choice that will come our way is not essential. 
		We need to plan, prepare and work and move forward with purpose in our 
		lives but we cannot expect everything to happen as we have planned. We 
		must be open to those unexpected opportunities that will come to us from 
		time to time. In fact the Lord will often give us those opportunities 
		because we have what is needed to bless someone elses life or the 
		ability to move his work forward. As is often the case, these 
		opportunities may move us out of our comfort zone. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I propose that each of us 
		needs 3 essential tools in our tool belt so we can move forward with 
		confidence and make choices that will bring us joy, bless the lives of 
		those </font><span style="color: #000080">around us and move the work of 
		the Lord forward. These tools are: first, An Eye of Faith, second, A 
		Willing Mind, and third, A Humble Heart. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">My first tool for your 
		tool belt then is an Eye of Faith. This tool allows us to</span><font color="#000080"> 
		move down a path that may be dimly lit or only lit for a short way. As 
		we place our faith in the Savior, we will come to understand that he 
		will lead us onto those paths that can bless us and others. We may not 
		be able to see very far down the road but the Lord can and if we are 
		pursuing a path that will be destructive to us, the Lord will warn us. 
		Nephi exhibited this type of faith when he said that he would go and do 
		the things the Lord had commanded even though he was lead by the 
		spirit not knowing beforehand the things that [he] should do.<sup><font size="1">7</font></sup> 
		So, even though he could not see where the path led, he had faith to 
		follow that path.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pres. Monson

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Many years ago, on an assignment to Tahiti, I was 
		talking to our mission president, President Raymond Baudin, about the 
		Tahitian people. They are known as some of the greatest seafaring people 
		in the world. Brother Baudin, who speaks French and Tahitian but little 
		English, was trying to describe to me the secret of the success of the 
		Tahitian sea captains. He said, they are amazing. The weather may be 
		terrible, the vessels may be leaky, there may be no navigational aids 
		except their inner feelings and the stars in the heavens, but they pray 
		and they go. He repeated that phrase three times. There is a lesson in 
		that statement. We need to pray, and then we need to act. Both are 
		important.<sup><font size="1">8</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As we utilize this tool and 
		move ahead on the path that we have chosen, the Lord will light the way 
		ahead of us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego 
		also illustrated this when they defied the Kings order to bow to the 
		golden image. They said: </font></p>

<font color="#000080">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to

		set up.<sup><font size="1">9</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These 3 young men did not 
		know where the path would lead but they knew that they were on the path 
		the Lord wanted them on so they moved ahead with confidence and stayed 
		on that path just as Abinidi did with King Noah. Because they all stayed 
		on the path the Lord had asked them to be on, they were ultimately saved 
		even though the temporal outcome of Abinidis trials was different that 
		the outcome of the 3 young mens. As is also illustrated by these 
		examples though, faith must be joined with preparation. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My second tool for your tool 
		belt then i</font><span style="color: #000080">s a Willing Mind. This
		</span><font color="#000080">quality deals with our willingness to learn 
		all we can while we are in mortality and then act or choose to act on 
		that knowledge. In essence it is the preparation of our minds. We should 
		never stop learning and growing. We need to take advantage of 
		opportunities that come to us. The Lord has blessed us with a mind and 
		he expects us to use it. He also expects us to be up and doing and not 
		sitting around waiting for things to happen to us. This is acting and 
		not waiting to be acted upon. This quality involves learning but it also 
		involves actively making choices for ourselves. I think of Victor 
		Frankels experiences in the concentration camps of World War II. He 
		said this:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">We who lived in concentration camps can remember 
		the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their 
		last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer 
		sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: 
		the last of the human freedoms  to choose ones attitude in any given 
		set of circumstances, to choose ones own way.<sup><font size="1">10</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Those who acted faired much 
		better than those who were passive. The attribute of a willing mind 
		means that we are looking for ways to grow, that we are seeking and 
		striving. A passage in a book I read this past summer struck me. It 
		stated, </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;To have a goal is the important thing, and to 
		work towards it. Then if you decide you wish to do something different,

		will have been learning.<sup><font size="1">11</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I would add that even if you 
		do not decide to do something different. Even if you are asked to do 
		something different or forced to do something different, you will be 
		prepared because you will at least have been moving, you will have been 
		learning. Just remember that what you are doing and learning today will 
		determine what opportunities the Lord can give you in the future. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In D &amp; C 84:85 the Lord says: 
		Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life. Your time at 
		BYUIdaho is a precious time because it is a concentrated time of 
		learning. Do you have a willing mind? Willing to learn, willing to 
		experience, willing to stretch? The Lord has also said, Seek ye 
		diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of 
		the best books words of wisdom; seek learning even by study and also by 
		faith.<sup><font size="1">12</font> </sup>But remember that our ability 
		to learn comes from the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My third tool for your tool 
		belt then is</font><span style="color: #000080"> a Humble Heart. To</span><font color="#000080"> 
		me this entails not only the ability to accept the Lords will for us 
		but also the quality of being teachable and willing to accept course 
		correction from the Lord and from others. To accept correction without 
		being offended. It also means taking the challenges of life in stride. 
		This is beautifully illustrated by this story as told by President 
		Faust:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">This story is about the great scientist Henry 
		Eyring, who served on the Bonneville Stake high council. He was 
		responsible for the welfare farm, which included a field of onions that 
		needed to be weeded. At that time, he was nearly 80 and suffering from 
		painful bone cancer. He assigned himself to do weeding even though the 
		pain was so great that he pulled himself along on his stomach with his 
		elbows. The pain was too great for him to kneel. Yet he smiled, laughed, 
		and talked happily with the others who were there that day weeding that 
		field of onions. I now quote what [President] Eyring said of this 
		incident: after all the work was finished and the onions were all 
		weeded, someone [said to] him, Henry good heavens! You didnt pull 
		those weeds, did you? Those weeds were sprayed two days ago, and they 
		were going to die anyway. Dad just roared. He thought that was the 
		funniest thing. He thought it was a great joke on himself. He had worked 
		through the day in the wrong weeds. They had been sprayed and would have 
		died anyway. I asked him, Dad how could you make a joke out of that? 
		He said something to me that I will never forget . . . He said, Hal, I 
		wasnt there for the weeds.<sup><font size="1">13</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Humility is often mistaken as 
		thinking less of ourselves than others but it is not that. It is the 
		ability to not think about ourselves at all, to truly lose ourselves. 
		Elder Oaks illustrates this with the following story. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font color="#000080">Some modern pioneers receive their tests at 
		bedside. One sister wrote: my mother cared for her mother until 
		[Grandma] was ninety-eight. My dad now has Alzheimers disease, and my 
		mother patiently cares for him. . . . The amazing part of this is the 
		attitude of my mother. She always thought she would travel after she 
		retired. She has always kept a beautiful home, loving to entertain 
		others. She maintains her home as best she can, but has had to put aside 
		many things that bring her joy. The amazing part is the joy my mother 
		radiates. Her attitude is so beautiful. She finds real joy in the simple 
		things of life. She is the pillar of strength to the whole family as she 
		uplifts us all with her positive attitude. <sup><font size="1">14</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joseph Smith understood this 
		attribute of having a humble heart. He had many experiences that 
		required humility. The Lord corrected him on many occasions but he was 
		humble enough to know that the Lord was trying to help him be successful 
		so he learned to take correction. He learned from it and moved ahead. 
		The Lord can help us to move ahead on our path of life as we humbly go 
		to him and seek his guidance. He has said, Be thou humble; and the Lord 
		thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy 
		prayers.<sup><font size="1">15</font></sup> You see it really does not 
		matter where we serve in this world or in the kingdom of God but it 
		matters very much how we serve.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now let us look at all three 
		of these tools together. All of us have aspirations. We all want to be 
		something and most of us have started down the path that will allow us 
		to reach that goal we have set. However, because we cannot see what is 
		over the next hill, we do not know if the path we are on will have a 
		detour or road block in it or if there will be a fork in the road. The 
		Lord knows what the pathways of our lives have in store for us. He will 
		sometimes direct us to a fork in the road and allow us to choose which 
		path we take. He may also invite us to choose a particular path because 
		the growth we will experience will prepare us for something that will 
		come later in life or because of the service we can give. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Because life is not a smooth 
		road with no bumps or detours and because these bumps and detours can 
		help us grow to become more like our Heavenly Father, we need to have 
		the tools of faith, willingness, and humility available to us and ready 
		to use at all times. We cannot afford to forget these or put them aside 
		because we think we know best. Remember to be learned is good, if [we] 
		hearken to the councils of God.<sup><font size="1">16</font></sup> I 
		like to think of these tools </font><span style="color: #000080">as 3 
		blades on the propeller of an airplane. </span><font color="#000080">If 
		you have all three blades then the propeller is balanced and the plane 
		can get proper thrust and move forward at a rate that will allow it to 
		fly. If however, one of the blades is missing, then the propeller is out 
		of balance and progress is stopped or badly hampered and the plane 
		cannot fly. What will happen if one of these three tools or blades is 
		missing from your life?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Faith is not effective if you 
		do not have a willing mind and the works to accompany that faith. 
		Learning is only good in the eyes of the Lord if you accompany it with 
		humility. Humility is self-righteousness if you do not trust (or have 
		faith) in the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord wants to bless us 
		and help us. He wants us to grow and progress to become like him. He 
		really is in the details of our lives. He knows us perfectly.<sup><font size="1">17</font></sup> 
		He will not make life easy for us but he will provide a way for us to 
		move forward. It may not be easy but it will be possible as we have 
		faith, humility and a willingness to move forward. Think of Joseph Smith 
		and all the hard experiences he had. Remember what the Lord told him in 
		D &amp; C 122:7 know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee 
		experience, and shall be for thy good. The same is true for us. The 
		Lord has great things </font><span style="color: #000080">in store for 
		us. He wants us to have the riches of eternity. He said in D &amp; C 58:3 
		Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the 
		design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, 
		and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation. But it does 
		not have to be tribulation. It can simply be detours on</span><font color="#000080"> 
		what we consider to be our road of life. I will give you one example 
		from my life. I am an entomologist by training. I study insects. I love 
		this and biology in general. I love to teach biology. However, currently 
		I am serving as the Department Chair for Teacher Education. I have had 
		no specific training to be a department chair, and I have also not had 
		any specific training in teacher education. I never expected to be a 
		department chair and I really never expected that opportunity to come in 
		teacher education but the opportunity did come. It has been an amazing 
		learning experience. I have grown in ways that would not have been 
		possible in any other way. At this point in my life the Lord has invited 
		me to move out of my comfort zone and onto a different path for a time. 
		We may not know why the Lord directs us in certain ways or why we are 
		given certain opportunities. The reasons may not be made clear until 
		after this life but if we will trust in the Lord, He will lead us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we face a fork in the 
		path of life or a detour on what we consider to be our path or a 
		possible road block, instead of asking why me, we need to ask the Lord 
		for direction, we need to listen and then we need to act on what we 
		believe to be the right path at that point in our lives. We need to use 
		these three tools to move ahead. Do not be blinded by possible worldly 
		success or worldly recognition in the choices you make. It may be that 
		what we learned to this point is what the Lord needs but that it will be 
		on a path we would not normally choose and that it will not bring 
		worldly recognition. Do not be afraid of going in directions you had not 
		planned. Some of the experiences you will have on these other pathways 
		of life will be your most rewarding. You will go places and do things in 
		your life that you never dreamed of but many of these opportunities will 
		only come to you as you have faith, are willing and learning, and humbly 
		move forward. If the door opens, will you have the faith to go through 
		it? Will you be prepared to move through it? Will you humbly accept the 
		Lords invitation to change course? Sometimes we put on blinders so we 
		only see straight down the path we have selected. We blind ourselves to 
		other opportunities because we are not willing or close our eyes, ears 
		or minds to the spirit inviting us in other directions. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">These experiences will be 
		more exciting and will help you grow if you have these tools and your 
		propeller is complete, if you have, first, An Eye of Faith, second, A 
		Willing Mind, and third, A Humble Heart. I think the 23<sup>rd</sup> 
		Psalm says it better than I can.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and 
				sisters, Sister Maynes and I are truly grateful for the 
				opportunity to be with you today.&nbsp; It is both an honor and a 
				privilege for us to be in your presence. &nbsp;I am grateful to the 
				First Presidency for this assignment to address you at your 
				devotional today. &nbsp;I would also like to express appreciation to 
				President and Sister Clark for their wonderful hospitality 
				during our visit to your beautiful campus.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the Book of Mormon 
				16 different chapters of Isaiah are quoted between chapters 7 
				and 24 of 2 Nephi. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I find it interesting 
				to note the words of the prophet Nephi at the conclusion of 
				these Isaiah quotes.&nbsp; He states in 2 Nephi, chapter 25: Now I, 
				Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have 
				written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah.&nbsp; For 
				behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my 
				people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of 
				prophesying among the Jews.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For I, Nephi, have 
				not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; 
				for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were 
				doings of abominations. . . .</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Wherefore, hearken, 
				O my people, which are the house of Israel, and give ear unto my 
				words. . . .&nbsp; I shall prophesy according to the plainness which 
				hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem 
				with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto 
				my people, that they may learn. . . .</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">. . .I proceed with 
				mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I 
				know that no man can err. . . .&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is obvious that 
				Nephi recognized the importance of understandable communications 
				with his people.&nbsp; He stated the reason he communicated in 
				plainness was so his people would learn and not err.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is my desire today 
				that through the power of the Spirit I might communicate with 
				you in plainness, that we may all learn and not err.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Those of you who have 
				served missions and those of you who are planning on serving a 
				full-time mission are familiar with the Churchs guide to 
				missionary service entitled <i>Preach My Gospel</i>.&nbsp; On page 
				146 of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> it states, Your mission 
				president may establish standards of excellence or mission goals 
				intended to raise your vision and increase your faith.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Today I would like to 
				share with you a standard of excellence for your college years 
				intended to raise your vision and increase your faith during 
				this most critical time of your life.&nbsp; This standard is very 
				simple and composed of three basic principles.&nbsp; If you will do 
				your very best to understand this standard of excellence and 
				live the principles taught, you will successfully establish the 
				celestial foundation upon which you will build a life of 
				happiness, fulfillment, and spiritual growth.&nbsp; You will become 
				the person you want to become and the person the Lord expects 
				you to become.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first principle I 
				would like to share with you and which is included in the 
				standard of excellence is the principle of gaining basic gospel 
				knowledge.&nbsp; In order to reach your full potential as 
				individuals, full-time missionaries, and future parents, it is 
				very important to study and understand basic gospel principles.&nbsp; 
				Only with a clear understanding of gospel principles will you be 
				assured that you are living celestial law and that you are 
				properly preparing yourselves for the future.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is a fact we live 
				in a world filled with false traditions.&nbsp; One of the great 
				blessings of being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
				Latter-day Saints is our access to truth.&nbsp; The scriptures tell 
				us that truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they 
				were, and as they are to come and any deviations from the truth 
				are done through the influence of the wicked one who was a liar 
				from the beginning.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We therefore have a 
				sacred responsibility to study and learn gospel truths.&nbsp; How do 
				you go about fulfilling this responsibility?&nbsp; Your personal 
				study plan will ultimately <u>not</u> only have an eternal 
				impact on you, but on your future investigators and your future 
				spouse and children.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you are asking 
				yourself where to begin, I would suggest using the Churchs 
				guide to missionary service, entitled <i>Preach My Gospel</i>.&nbsp; 
				This inspired guide is a wonderful personal scripture study plan 
				as well as a missionary guide.&nbsp; Chapter 3 of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> 
				contains five lessons, The Message of the Restoration, The 
				Plan of Salvation, The Gospel of Jesus Christ, The 
				Commandments, and finally Laws and Ordinances.&nbsp; These five 
				lessons contain a total of 42 basic gospel principles.&nbsp; 
				Thirty-five of these principles need to be taught to 
				investigators before they are eligible for baptism.&nbsp; The 
				investigators not only need to understand the principles, but 
				they also need to live them prior to baptism.&nbsp; It seems it would 
				be appropriate for us as members to understand these same basic 
				gospel principles and the corresponding scriptures that support 
				them.&nbsp; The gospel principles and associated scriptures found in 
				chapter 3 of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> would make a wonderful 
				personal study plan.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On the other hand, 
				Satan would prefer us to be ignorant of gospel truths.&nbsp; He wants 
				us, as individuals and parents, to teach those whom we come in 
				contact with and especially our children false traditions.&nbsp; 
				Satan is looking for multigenerational success.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
				he has enjoyed great success in deceiving children through the 
				false traditions and teachings of their parents.&nbsp; In Doctrine 
				and Covenants section 74, verse 4 it states, And it came to 
				pass that the children. . .gave heed to the traditions of their 
				fathers and believed not the gospel of Christ, wherein they 
				became unholy. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&quot;The Family: A 
				Proclamation to the World&quot; is an inspired document introduced to 
				the world on September 23, 1995.&nbsp; It is one of five 
				proclamations issued by the First Presidency and Council of the 
				Twelve Apostles since the Restoration of the Church in 1830.&nbsp; It 
				is, in fact, a prophetic guideline or blueprint that will help 
				you prepare for the establishment of your own Christ-centered 
				family, or if already married, help you to raise your children 
				in light and truth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If we follow the 
				counsel of our prophets and apostles found in this inspired 
				document, we will avoid the problem of living and teaching false 
				traditions.&nbsp; I would like to share with you a portion of this 
				prophetic guideline.&nbsp; This quotation is found in paragraph seven 
				of the proclamation:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">The family is ordained of God.&nbsp; Marriage 
				between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan.&nbsp; 
				Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, 
				and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows 
				with complete fidelity.&nbsp; Happiness in family life is most likely 
				to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus 
				Christ.&nbsp; Successful marriages and families are established and 
				maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, 
				forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome 
				recreational activities.&nbsp; By divine design, fathers are to 
				preside over their families in love and righteousness and are 
				responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection 
				for their families.&nbsp; Mothers are primarily responsible for the 
				nurture of their children.&nbsp; In these sacred responsibilities, 
				fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal 
				partners.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This portion of the 
				proclamation instructs us that Christ must be at the center of 
				our lives and the lives of our family members and that success 
				in life depends on establishing gospel principles as the 
				traditions that will define our family life.&nbsp; Eternal happiness 
				will not be achieved based on the psychological theories of the 
				day, a self-help seminar, or even competent therapy.&nbsp; True 
				happiness can only be found in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we know we are 
				to be judged based on how we fulfilled our family 
				responsibilities, it is perplexing to see some fathers and 
				mothers ignore the counsel given by our prophets and apostles 
				and choose to live and teach traditions in the home that are 
				contrary to those found in the proclamation.&nbsp; Outside of the 
				scriptures, I know of no other document that focuses on the 
				spiritual well-being of individuals and families and which 
				contains such a concentration of true principles and celestial 
				traditions as &quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World.&quot;&nbsp; I 
				counsel you to include it with the scriptures and <i>Preach My 
				Gospel </i>as part of your regular scripture study plan.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters 
				dont underestimate the importance of personal gospel 
				knowledge.&nbsp; The knowledge you obtain of gospel principles will 
				be brought to your mind by the power of the Spirit to assist you 
				in effectively living and teaching true principles.&nbsp; This will 
				be the case in your private lives, in your missionary lives, and 
				in your role as parents.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I would like now to 
				make the transition between the first principle found in the 
				standard of excellence, which is obtaining gospel knowledge, and 
				the second principle, which is the application of that knowledge 
				in our everyday lives.&nbsp; The application of knowledge is another 
				way of saying the exercise of our agency.&nbsp; When we live truth, 
				we exercise our agency wisely. If we reject truth and choose to 
				live false traditions we fail to live up to our divine 
				potential.&nbsp; This principle is clearly taught and illustrated in 
				Helaman 14:30:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And now remember, 
				remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto 
				himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; 
				for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; 
				for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made 
				you free.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As members of The 
				Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have been given 
				knowledge of true principles and the freedom to internalize and 
				apply them or not.&nbsp; In other words, we ultimately decide our own 
				destiny.&nbsp; Our future is determined by our everyday choices.&nbsp; 
				Faithfulness and an ever-growing testimony are the ingredients 
				which allow the Holy Ghost to bless our lives. &nbsp;His influence 
				and promptings are needed if we are to continue making good 
				decisions.&nbsp; If you want to make good decisions, be worthy of the 
				promptings of the Spirit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Doctrine and 
				Covenants section 45, verse 57 states, For they that are wise . 
				. . have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, 
				is the Holy Ghost your guide?&nbsp; Does He help you make your 
				decisions?&nbsp; In this world of ever-increasing promiscuity, you 
				are not left alone.&nbsp; One of the great responsibilities of the 
				Holy Ghost is to help you make good decisions.&nbsp; He can be your 
				dearest and most trusted friend when it comes time to make a 
				decision.&nbsp; Our journey through these troubled times is not meant 
				to be a solitary journey.&nbsp; It was intended that we make this 
				journey with a good and capable guide, even the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If we truly love the 
				Lord, we will follow Him. &nbsp;He states in John 14, verse 15, If 
				ye love me, keep my commandments.&nbsp; When we truly love the Lord, 
				we keep His commandments.&nbsp; Our love of the Lord will spiritually 
				motivate us to become worthy of the influence of the Spirit.&nbsp; 
				Repentance is the process of becoming and being worthy of the 
				Spirit in our lives.&nbsp; The word <i>repentance</i> in the ancient 
				Greek and Hebrew means to changechange ones mind, change ones 
				heart, and change ones position or behavior.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When the Lord and His 
				servants throughout history have cried repentance to the people, 
				they have done nothing more than petition them to change their 
				behavior and live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 
				Therefore the question &quot;Have you repented?&quot;&nbsp; You know if you 
				have properly repented by how you feel.&nbsp; An example in Church 
				history might help us understand this principle.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In June of 1829, 
				Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, Martin Harris, and Joseph Smith 
				went into the woods near the Whitmer home in Fayette, New York, 
				and began to pray for the privilege of viewing the golden 
				plates.&nbsp; Martin Harris soon removed himself from the group, 
				feeling unworthy.&nbsp; He moved to another area in the woods to 
				offer prayer.&nbsp; Later on Joseph Smith found him praying.&nbsp; They 
				offered prayer together and then saw the same vision of Moroni 
				that Joseph had just experienced with Oliver Cowdery and David 
				Whitmer.&nbsp; They also heard the voice of God testifying of the 
				truthfulness of the translation of the Book of Mormon and 
				commanding them to bear record of what they had seen and heard.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you feel the 
				influence and promptings of the Holy Ghost in your life, then 
				you know you are worthy.&nbsp; If you have any doubts regarding your 
				worthiness, please seek counsel from your priesthood leaders.&nbsp; 
				They will be able to assist you in the process.&nbsp; Alma counseled 
				his son Corianton regarding this principle in this way:&nbsp; Only 
				let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring 
				you down unto repentance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember it is 
				through the atoning sacrifice of the Savior we can be freed from 
				the guilt that accompanies our sins.&nbsp; Listen to this wonderful 
				promise of the Lord regarding those who truly repent; and we 
				just heard this verse a few minutes ago.&nbsp; Behold, he who has 
				repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, 
				remember them no more. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is true that we 
				are not perfect, but through, the process of repentance, we can 
				become worthy to feel and hear the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember that the 
				first principle in our standard of excellence was that of 
				obtaining gospel knowledge.&nbsp; Our second principle is that of 
				properly applying those truths in our lives.&nbsp; Worthy members 
				rely on the promptings and influence of the Holy Ghost to guide 
				them in this process.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now I would like to 
				transition to the third and final principle in the standard of 
				excellence for building a life of happiness, fulfillment, and 
				spiritual growth.&nbsp; This is the principle which, when applied, 
				acts as the catalyst that binds the first two principles 
				together.&nbsp; This is the principle of being honest with the Lord.&nbsp; 
				Being honest with the Lord binds together the basic gospel 
				knowledge we learn with our willingness to apply that knowledge 
				in our lives.&nbsp; In other words, when we are honest with the Lord 
				we act upon our knowledge by being obedient to His commandments.
				</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, 
				being honest with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ means we are 
				true to the covenants we have made with Them.&nbsp; Almost all of us 
				here today have made covenants or promises to the Lord.&nbsp; We made 
				promises to the Lord when we were baptized, and we make 
				additional promises to Him as we participate in temple 
				ordinances.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There is nothing more 
				important in life than being true to the covenants or promises 
				we have made with the Lord.&nbsp; Our eternal life depends on the 
				principle of honesty.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord reminds us 
				each week how important these covenants are by allowing us the 
				privilege of renewing them as we partake of the sacrament.&nbsp; When 
				we honestly take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always 
				remember Him, and keep His commandments, we can and will be 
				worthy of His Spirit.&nbsp; This great blessing and gift of the Holy 
				Ghost will guide, direct, and influence us for good throughout 
				our lives. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On the other hand, 
				when we break a commandment, we are actually breaking our word, 
				our promises, and our covenants.&nbsp; We are being dishonest with 
				the Lord.&nbsp; When we are dishonest with the Lord, we are, in fact, 
				working against His work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In todays culture 
				the principle of honesty at times seems to be seldom talked 
				about and often abused.&nbsp; The world is filled with false 
				tradition of corruptioncorruption in government and politics, 
				corruption in business and even athletics.&nbsp; Honesty, it seems, 
				must take a back seat to the worldly aspiration of getting ahead 
				at any cost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Therefore, the big 
				questions and ultimate decisions are these: Will I be true to 
				the covenants I have made to the Lord in the waters of baptism 
				and in the holy temple?&nbsp; Will I be honest with the Lord?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Is it possible to 
				succeed in this world and at the same time be true to your 
				covenants?&nbsp; I believe it is.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many years ago when I 
				was president of a company that specialized in factory 
				automation, I was confronted with a situation that taught me the 
				importance and the benefit of keeping promises no matter what 
				the cost.&nbsp; This was the situation:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
				Our company was going through a phase of rapid growth.&nbsp; We were 
				engineering, fabricating, and installing automated production 
				lines in factories around the world.&nbsp; We were hiring personnel 
				and building increased factory capacity as fast as we could.&nbsp;
				</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
				We had accepted the order on a large project in Scotland for a 
				multinational corporation.&nbsp; We had agreed to a specific delivery 
				date on the project.&nbsp; As the promised delivery date approached, 
				it became obvious that we would not be able to meet the 
				schedule.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
				We met as an executive council and discussed the matter.&nbsp; After 
				careful analysis it looked like we would miss the delivery date 
				by approximately three weeks.&nbsp; While studying the detailed 
				schedule of the project, it was pointed out that the critical 
				path included a shipment window of approximately three weeks.&nbsp; 
				The production line equipment would be shipped from our 
				California factory over land to New Orleans and then transported 
				via cargo ship to Liverpool, England, then across land to 
				Scotland. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
				&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
				It became obvious that the only way we would be able to keep our 
				word and make the delivery date would be a very expensive 
				option.&nbsp; It was decided that we would lease wide-bodied jets and 
				ship all the equipment for the Scotland factory via air

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Dr. Benjamin Martinez 
				shared the following example that illustrates this dichotomy:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">Of all the kinds and colors of marble, 
				the milky white Carrara is the rarest and most costly.&nbsp; 
				Sculptors who lived during the Golden Age of Tuscan Sculpture 
				claimed that it was the purest substance God ever created, and 
				they longed for the feel of it beneath their hands.&nbsp; Any 
				sculptor who was commissioned by a wealthy patron of the arts to 
				create a statue of Carrara marble felt himself to be highly 
				favored.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&quot;Sculpting in marble was neither fast nor 
				easy.&nbsp; In addition to innate talent, it required both careful 
				analysis and tedious, backbreaking work.&nbsp; The artist would have 
				to study the block of marble to determine its essential nature.&nbsp; 
				He would then need to discover the direction of the grain and 
				ascertain the presence of any flaws.&nbsp; He had to make careful and 
				precise plans and drawings that were in accord with the 
				structure of the marble itself.&nbsp; Then, with consummate care, he 
				would begin to chip off the superfluous marble, layer by layer, 
				until he revealed the form he had envisioned.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&quot;Any mistake could be disastrous.&nbsp; If the 
				sculptor went against the grain he could crack the marble; if he 
				struck with a blow with too much force he could mash the 
				crystals beneath the surface, creating holes and ruining the 
				sculpture.&nbsp; This seldom happened with the greatest of sculptors, 
				who labored with infinite care and supreme sensitivity.&nbsp; Those 
				with lesser talent and little patience, however, would 
				occasionally be confronted with such a disaster.&nbsp; Rather than 
				admit their blunder and lose their commission, some would resort 
				to subterfuge.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&quot;Soft, white wax, skillfully applied, 
				could usually disguise the damage.&nbsp; In outward appearance the 
				sculpture appeared to be flawless and the defect was seldom 
				discovered until well after the work had been accepted and the 
				commission paid.&nbsp; As the practice became more common, patrons of 
				the arts became more discerning.&nbsp; They refused to accept a piece 
				of marble statuary until after a careful examination had been 
				made to ensure that it was undamaged and contained no 
				wax-covered flaws.&nbsp; The highest standard of excellence for works 
				of white Carrara marble came to include the distinction, sine 
				cere, meaning without wax.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&quot;Eventually these two words merged to 
				become a single word, in Spanish sincera or in English 
				sincere meaning pure, unadulterated, whole, intact, and 
				uninjured.&nbsp; When the word was used to refer to marble works of 
				art, the emphasis was on the fundamental wholeness of the 
				statue, not just on its superficial appearance or outward 
				appearance.&nbsp; The statue was expected to be good, not just to 
				look good.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"> </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, 
				in a gospel context, we as members of The Church of Jesus Christ 
				of Latter-day Saints are expected to be righteous, not just 
				appear to be righteous.&nbsp; What we believe and what we say and 
				what we do should all be the same thing.&nbsp; This is the definition 
				of integrity.&nbsp; A person of integrity does not cover his sins in 
				order to look good to the outside world.&nbsp; A person of integrity 
				repents of behavior unbecoming a member of the Church, embraces 
				and lives new habits and lifestyles, and tries to eliminate the 
				flaws in his or her life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One of the great 
				blessings I enjoyed while serving as a mission president in 
				Mexico many years ago was the privilege of interviewing the 
				missionaries.&nbsp; I interviewed missionaries when they arrived from 
				the MTC.&nbsp; I had regular interviews with each missionary on a 
				monthly basis during his or her mission, and then I had the 
				great privilege of interviewing missionaries at the end of their 
				mission just prior to their departure. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I learned an 
				interesting lesson when I first started giving these exit 
				interviews to the sister missionaries.&nbsp; On many occasions, 
				before the interview concluded the sister missionaries would ask 
				me this question: President, how will I know when I meet the 
				young man I should marry?&nbsp; Wow, that question caught me off 
				guard.&nbsp; How would you answer that?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I wanted to be able 
				to give some counsel on the subject, but I knew that I needed to 
				be very careful.&nbsp; At first I responded by saying that the 
				decision of whom you will marry is very personal and it will 
				ultimately be decided between you and the Lord.&nbsp; You will need 
				to make it a matter of prayer.&nbsp; I felt that was an appropriate 
				answer, but I also wanted to add some practical advice that 
				might be of some additional assistance.&nbsp; After much thought and 
				prayer I felt I had received inspiration on what I might add to 
				my answer.&nbsp; The direction the answer took was a little bit 
				surprising to me.&nbsp; This is how I finally answered the question: 
				Sister, the decision of whom you will ultimately marry will be 
				one of the most important decisions of your entire life.&nbsp; It is 
				very personal and you will need to make it with the help of the 
				Lord.&nbsp; You will need to make it a matter of earnest prayer. 
				&nbsp;There is one additional idea I might share with you that could 
				be of some help.&nbsp; When you start to date a young man, you might 
				consider observing his attitude regarding the principle of 
				tithing. If he doesnt pay an honest tithing, run the other 
				way.&nbsp; If he pays his tithing but complains about doing it, run 
				the other way.&nbsp; However, if he pays an honest and full tithing 
				and he does it with a smile, knowing he is being faithful to his 
				covenants and helping to build the kingdom, you might consider 
				giving him a fair chance.&nbsp; Im not saying you should marry him.&nbsp; 
				Im just saying this: &nbsp;if he is willing to be honest with the 
				Lord and sacrifice a bit for Him, there is the probability he 
				will ultimately be honest with his future wife and be willing to 
				sacrifice for her and his future family.&nbsp; Paying a full tithing 
				is a matter of honesty, honesty to the Lord.&nbsp; Will a man rob 
				God?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, 
				most of you in this congregation today are living within the 
				decade of vital decision making.&nbsp; This is the decade between 18 
				and 28 years old.&nbsp; If you could project yourselves into the 
				future, see yourselves in the twilight of your lives and reflect 
				back on the most important decisions you ever made in your life, 
				the decisions that had the greatest impact on your celestial 
				future, you would see that most, if not all, of those decisions 
				were made between the ages of 18 and 28.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Satans greatest 
				desire is to deceive and motivate us to become less than our

				However his techniques and tools are updated at the speed of 
				technology.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember the story of 
				Korihor.&nbsp; It is found in Alma, chapter 30.&nbsp; Compare some of his 
				false teachings with todays secular philosophies.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Quote: And this

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ye look forward and

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"> And many more such

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Korihor, after it was

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But behold, the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And thus we see the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Through the example

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So who are the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, 
				the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ and revealed to prophets 
				throughout the ages is true and needs to be understood and 
				applied if we want to return to live with Heavenly Father and 
				Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Basic principles and ordinances of the gospel of 
				Jesus Christ are not negotiable.&nbsp; They represent the foundation 
				upon which life is lived in the celestial kingdom.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is true that we 
				can exercise our agency and choose not to live celestial law, 
				but it is also true that we will ultimately be compelled to 
				accept the result of that decision when our inheritance is 
				justifiably terrestrial or telestial.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now the first 
				principle in the standard of excellence was that of obtaining 
				gospel knowledge.&nbsp; Of course we all understand that obtaining 
				truth is meaningless if we do not apply it in our lives.&nbsp; But 
				be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your 
				own selves. &nbsp;Therefore, the second principle in the standard of 
				excellence was applying gospel knowledge in our everyday life.&nbsp; 
				The third and final principle in the standard of excellence was 
				that of being honest with the Lord.&nbsp; Honesty is the trait which 
				connects the promises we have made to the Lord to our everyday 
				actions.&nbsp; If we are honest we will, in fact, keep the covenants 
				we have made in the waters of baptism and in the holy temples of 
				the Lord.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Remember, the Lord 
				expects us as members in His Church to not only appear to be 
				good but to actually be good.&nbsp; We are ultimately responsible to 
				not only learn gospel principles but apply them in our lives.&nbsp; 
				If we are honest with the Lord, He will help us succeed through 
				the power of the Spirit.&nbsp; The Lord, in Doctrine and Covenants, 
				section 78, verse 7, emphasizes this doctrine:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For if you will that

				required of you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I bear you my humble 
				witness of the reality of a loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I bear you 
				my witness of the reality of the great plan of salvation and 
				happiness and the important role that Jesus Christ plays within 
				that plan as our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; The gospel of Jesus 
				Christ, in its fullness, has been restored to the earth in 
				these, the latter days. President Thomas S. Monson is the Lords 
				chosen prophet on earth today.&nbsp; Of these true principles I 
				testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

		About 15 years ago I was in my car somewhere on the North Dakota prairie 
		headed home to Grand Forks. It was a typical winter night in North 
		Dakota  10 degrees below zero, waves of powdery snow blowing across the 
		highway, thousands of stars visible in the clear moonless sky, not a 
		town or car in sight. I was checking channels on the radio and came upon 
		an interesting program. It featured the conductor of a symphony 
		orchestra. He was analyzing a passage from a Mozart symphony. He was 
		attempting to pinpoint and describe the genius of this particular 
		composition. Even though I lacked a full technical understanding of his 
		explanation, I was fascinated by the analysis and, of course, I was duly 
		reminded that Mozart was indeed a musical genius. At the conclusion of 
		the vignette the radio announcer said, Join us next time for another 
		episode of <i>What Makes it Great.</i></span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">In 
		the moment that I heard the title of that radio program, <i>What Makes 
		it Great</i>, I had one of those wonderful moments of enlightenment that 
		was about 20 years in the making. I understood what it was that so many 
		of my undergraduate professors were trying to teach me when I was a 
		college student. Through their choice of subject matter and readings for 
		classes, and through their comments about things that were important to 
		know, they were exposing me to what was the most interesting, the most 
		profound, the most successful, the most beautiful, in essence, the best 
		that their discipline had to offer. On that frigid night as I 
		experienced this insight, I was warmed by a feeling of tremendous 
		gratitude for the great gift I had been given those many years ago.</span></font></p>

		Specifically, the part of my undergraduate curriculum in which these 
		teachings were most prominent was my general education. We knew it then 
		by the same acronym that you know it now:&nbsp;GE. I would like to discuss 
		that part of your education with you today. My only qualification to 
		talk on this subject is that I am a product of what I considered to be a 
		great general education. I was simply an ordinary student just like you 
		who ended up being profoundly affected by that experience. The seeds 
		that were planted in me some 30 years ago have born much fruit in my 
		life and those principles, habits of mind, values, and even knowledge 
		are still a vibrant and important part of my life today. My wife would 
		tell you the same thing as we have shared many wonderful experiences 
		that came about or that were enhanced because of our undergraduate 
		general education. </span></font></p>

		The topic is timely because this semester we have launched a new 
		approach to general education which, as you know, is called Foundations. 
		This new curriculum has enormous potential to bless your lives given its 
		unique approach and concepts, and especially its connection with another 
		one of our recent innovations, the BYU</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Idaho

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">I 
		begin with a series of related questions: Does the Lord really care 
		about you having a Foundations experience? In what ways would a 
		disciple-leader benefit from the Foundations program of study? Why would 
		the Lord want you to step outside your chosen career path to learn extra 
		stuff? Does your Father in Heaven really care that you write and speak 
		well, or that you are able to wrestle with the thorny issues of our 
		time, or that you are able to appreciate and even understand certain 
		artistic achievements? Why would He want you to delve deeply into any 
		issue or idea that is not mainstream gospel? When I ask these 
		questions in the way that I have, it may seem obvious that, of course, 
		the Lord wants His disciple-leaders to have these experiences because 
		they will help them to be better disciples and better leaders. I hope to 
		impress upon your minds today that this is the indeed the case.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">I 
		start with Academic Fundamentals. This area involves writing and 
		reasoning (please note that its not just writing), professional 
		communication, and quantitative reasoning. I would like to think that we 
		all agree about the value of writing and reasoning. Unfortunately, I 
		know there are a few students who might not share that sentiment. A few 
		years ago my wife showed me a paper written by one of her students and 
		asked, What do you think of this paper? My assessment of it wasnt 
		very kind. I said it was a very bad piece of writing. She said, Thats 
		what I thought. She called the young man into her office and expressed 
		her concerns. Surprisingly, he was not the least bit flustered by the 
		feedback. He said, Oh, Sister Bergstrom, Im not worried. I plan on 
		being rich enough to hire people to write for me. Of course, the 
		student completely missed the point because writing is far more than 
		just grammar and editorial style. It is a manifestation of our thinking.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">As 
		I have pondered this issue, I hear the voice of two great Book of Mormon 
		prophets, Nephi and Moroni, who lamented their perceived writing 
		deficiencies. Nephi said, &quot;... neither am I mighty in writing, like unto 
		speaking.&quot; (2 Nephi 33:1). Moroni was more specific. He said, And thou 
		hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness 
		of our hands and We stumble because of the placing of our words. 
		(Ether 12:24-25). In frustration he cries out to the Lord,  the 
		Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing; 
		for Lord, thou has made us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not 
		made us mighty in writing; for thou has made all this people that they 
		could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them. 
		(Ether 12:23) Moroni dearly wishes that he could write like the Brother 
		of Jared whose writing was so effective, as he reports, that it would 
		literally overpower readers.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Moroni concludes his lamentation by telling us that he has seen and 
		talked with the Savior, but cannot tell us anything about it because of 
		his inability to write. Oh, that Moroni and his fellow Book of Mormon 
		prophets could have had a Foundations writing experience! What 
		additional sublime experiences and truths could have been passed on to 
		us? Now lest we be too harsh, we should note that these prophets lived 
		in a culture where the oral tradition was predominant and writing 
		technology was primitive. In spite of what these prophets said about 
		their writing ability, I think we can all agree that Nephi and Moroni 
		were truly great writers, and that their teachings and testimonies have 
		had a powerful impact upon the lives of the millions of people who have 
		read their words in the Book of Mormon.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Lets turn to professional communication, another critical part of the 
		Academic Fundamentals experience. If there was one glaring deficiency in 
		my undergraduate education it was not being able to speak effectively. 
		As undergraduates we worked very hard on our writing and worked very 
		little on being able to articulate our thoughts in speech, especially in 
		real-time. As part of your Foundations experience, you have an 
		incredible opportunity to learn to verbalize your thoughts by engaging 
		in meaningful discussions and by being able to teach others what you 
		know because Foundations courses are coupled with a learning model that 
		invites you to come to class prepared, ready to articulate your ideas 
		and to teach other classmates. Many of your teachers will expect you to 
		do this. I and my fellow undergraduates never did much of that, even 
		though our teachers encouraged us to do so. I had to develop this skill 
		on-the-job, as it were. You will be much further ahead than I was.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Your speech and your writing will portray to the world who you are. A 
		disciple-leader will want that portrayal to be as clear and true as 
		possible. There should be no mystery or ambiguity about who you are and 
		where you stand based on your words and speech. Furthermore, consider 
		how these skills will help you as you rear your family, build the 
		Kingdom of God, and communicate with others in your community and at 
		your workplace. As you acquire these skills you must be especially 
		careful that you dont misuse them. If you use the elevated vocabulary 
		and rhetorical skills that you acquire in your Foundations experience 
		for vanity, manipulation, or shading the truth, or if you use these 
		skills as a weapon  for example, being sarcastic or belittling to 
		others  your education will have been in vain. Many of you will live 
		among Saints and neighbors who have not had the blessing of higher 
		education. You are not better than them because you are articulate or 
		good with words. You simply have developed a significant talent and it 
		should be used to bless, edify, and serve others. As Paul taught, we all 
		have need of each others talents.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		The last element of the Academic Fundamentals area is quantitative 
		reasoning. Thats not just a euphemism for math. It is so much more than 
		mathematical computing and formulas. Some of you might be thinking that 
		the only quantitative ability needed by a disciple-leader is how to 
		calculate 10% of ones income. This is important, but it is not enough. 
		In his introduction to the Word of Wisdom, the Lord stated, In 
		consequence of evils and designs which do exist in the hearts of 
		conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you and forewarned you . 
		. . (D&amp;C 89:4) Conspiring men frequently use faulty numbers and bogus 
		numerical reasoning to get your money, your loyalty, and your attention. 
		Numbers have an aura of objectivity and truth. Numbers are an easy way 
		to deceive people who are unable to process them correctly. A 
		disciple-leader who can detect those deceptions which misuse numbers is 
		not easily led down false paths.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Beyond that, many important decisions in life depend upon a certain 
		level of ability to work with numbers. You will all buy a house someday. 
		You will all have to make investment decisions for your retirement. You 
		will have personal and professional challenges related to budgets and 
		money. A disciple-leader will want to be prepared to make good decisions 
		when the stakes are high. A disciple-leader will want to use the 
		financial resources at his or her disposal wisely and with integrity so 
		that he or she is never ethically compromised in any way. Consider how 
		much more effective you will be as a disciple-leader free from the 
		burdens of unsound financial decisions.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Now, lets turn to the Sciences area of your Foundations experience. Why

		Philosophers would observe that Alma was making a teleological argument 
		for the existence of God. Maybe youll learn about that in one of your 
		Foundations courses. Alma is right. You can't help but be awestruck by 
		looking into the night sky. On a clear night there are about 10,000 
		stars visible to the naked eye. Beyond this visible layer lies an 
		uncountable array of heavenly objects. The Hubble telescope has captured 
		images of very small segments of space in which there are hundreds of 
		galaxies populated by trillions of stars. We have an equally wondrous 
		view of Gods greatness and glory as we contemplate the Earth and how it 
		works, or the human body and how it and its various components work, or 
		human behavior and how it works in all its dimensions, and ultimately 
		matter itself and how it works. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		For the disciple-leader, the study of science is the study of Gods 
		creations. Jesus said, Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I 
		created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. (3 
		Nephi 9: 15) Surely, He would appreciate the fact that you would spend 
		time delving deeply into one or more parts of His handiwork, trying to 
		understand and talk about what makes Him great. This is a form of 
		worship. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
		Two important spiritual side benefits for the disciple-leader come from 
		studying science. First, as Alma indicated, you acquire evidence of a 
		supreme and intelligent Creator. Understand that this is not conclusive 
		proof. You would do well to re-read talks given by Elder Richard G. 
		Scott in the October 2007 general conference and Elder Dallin H. Oaks in 
		the April 2008 General Conference on this topic. As both of these 
		brethren taught, scientific inquiry yields evidence; the Holy Ghost 
		provides the conclusive proof. The example of Korihor, the non-believer, 
		clearly shows that one can have much evidence and, for whatever reasons, 
		still refuse to believe.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">A 
		second side benefit is a deep sense of humility and a sense of place in 
		the scheme of things as one contemplates Gods grandeur. Jacob taught: 
		&quot;Behold great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable 
		are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man 
		should find out all his ways.&quot; (Jacob 4:8) Disciple-leaders will use 
		their learning from the sciences to develop a profound appreciation for 
		our Creator and to use this understanding to build and strengthen others 
		in their faith. They will always know that mans scientific and 
		technological achievements, no matter how impressive, will always fall 
		short of our Fathers magnificent accomplishments.</span></font></p>

		Id like to focus on the part of this area which deals with the creative 
		accomplishments of mankind, specifically music and literature. One of my 
		general education requirements was to attend a certain number of 
		cultural events. Does that sound familiar? I decided I would attend an 
		upcoming performance by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra. The concert was to 
		be held in the Marriott Center. I thought to myself, Thats where they 
		play basketball, not violins. Even though I didnt hate classical 
		music, I didnt exactly embrace it either. My mother had taken us as 
		small children to see the Utah Symphony on one or two occasions. They 
		were thoroughly enjoyable outings. But, I went to this one with a little 
		bit of the attitude that Im really not into this type of music. The 
		first number to be performed was a piece composed by Igor Stravinsky 
		called the Firebird Suite. It only took about 60 seconds into the piece 
		for me to become completely mesmerized by the music I was hearing. I had 
		never heard music like this before. The remainder of the concert was 
		equally beautiful and impressive to me. I could not remember having 
		witnessed such a display of skill and perfection. The experience changed 
		me. I discovered that what we call classical music could engage me 
		spiritually, intellectually, and aesthetically in a way few things 
		outside the gospel could. </span></font></p>

		of great music from all genres. Disciple-leaders who surround themselves

		children of God are capable of great nobility and expressions of beauty. 
		By seeking out the things which are, as the 13<sup>th</sup> Article of

		The Savior instructed his disciples, Behold, I send you forth as sheep 
		in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as 
		doves. (Matthew 10:16) The Saviors use of the serpent symbol here is 
		curious because the snake is generally associated with craftiness and 
		deception rather than wisdom. In my interpretation, to be wise as a 
		serpent means to use your intellectual and spiritual resources to see 
		through the fog of uncertainty, even deception, and determine a course 
		of action which is correct or at least optimal. It is to use these 
		resources to correctly judge which things are right and praiseworthy, 
		and which things are not, in a world which routinely presents evil 
		things as either morally neutral or morally acceptable. And then, having 
		made your determination, you remain humble, peaceable, and agreeable, as 
		represented by the symbols of the dove and the sheep.</span></font></p>
