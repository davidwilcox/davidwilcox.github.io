<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font size="2">January 5, 1999</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">In the year and a half that I have 		been serving as the president of Ricks College, I have participated in 		more than 50 devotional assemblies.&nbsp; Worshipping with students like 		you each week is a great blessing in my life.&nbsp; I love looking into 		your faces from the stand and appreciate your preparation to worship and 		your eagerness to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">I have noted that many, if not most, of our
    devotional speakers at Ricks College begin their remarks by emphasizing that the youth in
    the Church today are a chosen generation and the most faithful and valiant young people to
    ever live upon the earth.&nbsp; I have often wondered if you hear this description so
    often that it becomes overused and trite&#151;and that its importance and deep
    implications may be overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Today in my remarks I am going to pay you the
    ultimate compliment.&nbsp; I will not spend much time telling you about who you are;
    rather, I am going to treat you like who you are.&nbsp; Because I love and trust you, I
    will strive to be direct without being overbearing.&nbsp; One of my primary objectives
    this afternoon is to cause you to think deeply and seriously about an important
    topic.&nbsp; I ask for both your attention and prayers as I speak, and I invite the Spirit
    of the Holy Ghost to be with us during this time together.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Today I want to discuss the
    relationship between the doctrine of Christ and your academic work at Ricks College.&nbsp;
    Simply stated, I want to discuss the doctrinal and spiritual reasons for being a		<b><i>diligent
    </i></b>student.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080">&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <b><u><font color="#000080">Faithful and
    Competent</font></u></b><font color="#000080"> </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">The following statement by Elder Richard L.
    Evans, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1953 to 1971, sets the stage for
    my message today.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>You know, it is a wonderful thing to be
      faithful, but a much greater thing to be both faithful and competent.&nbsp; There is no
      particular virtue in being uninformed, certainly no virtue in ignorance.&nbsp; When young
      people can acquire the skills, the techniques, and the knowledge of these times, and along
      with it have a spiritual commitment and a solid faith and cleanliness of life, there is
      nothing that you can&#146;t achieve; nothing in righteousness or in reason.&nbsp; (From an
      address given to the young people at the Northwest Inland Division Gathered for
      Zion&#146;s Camp, October 15, 1971)</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As students, I fear we may sometimes falsely
    separate spiritual development and progress (what I will refer to today as		<i>faithfulness</i>)
    from academic discipline and competence (what I will refer to today as <i>diligence</i>).&nbsp;
    Some students may even naively believe that irregular class attendance or a lesser level
    of academic performance is understandable and perhaps even&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />excusable because they are conscientious in attending church
    meetings and stalwart in serving their fellowmen.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My purpose today is to admonish you to
    use your academic opportunities to the fullest and to avoid at all costs the academic path
    of least resistance.&nbsp; Specifically, I challenge you as a student at Ricks College to
    be diligent in <u>both</u> your spiritual and academic pursuits or, as Elder Evans said,
    to be both faithful and competent.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please understand that when I use words such
    as &#147;<b><i>diligent</i></b>&#148; and &#147;<b><i>competent</i></b>&#148; I am not
    simply talking about performing well on tests and receiving good grades.&nbsp; A student
    can memorize wonderfully and perform well on exams and ultimately know very little or
    nothing at all. The academic path of least resistance to which I refer can be described in
    a number of ways.&nbsp; It is characterized by questions and statements such as
    these:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <ul> <li><font color="#000080">&#147;Is this class an easy A?&#148;&nbsp;</font></li> <li><font color="#000080">&#147;Please tell me exactly what I have to do to get a good grade
        on this paper?&#148;&nbsp;</font></li> <li><font color="#000080">&#147;Who is the easiest teacher in this department?&#148;&nbsp;</font></li> <li><font color="#000080">&#147;I have calculated my total points for the semester, and I
        only have to get 75% on the final exam to keep my A in the class.&#148;&nbsp;</font></li> </ul> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is also characterized by a student who,
    during registration last semester, considered taking a rigorous and challenging course
    that promised both hard work and significant learning.&nbsp; The student&#146;s response
    to the demands of the class reveal a real poverty of perspective and is summarized in the
    following actual comment:&nbsp; &#147;Are the tests really hard?&nbsp; I have a 3.9 thus
    far in my college career, and I will not take any class that might jeopardize my&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	<br />cumulative GPA.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, your
    college experience is not merely a game to be played with the ultimate winner determined
    by test scores and GPA.&nbsp; College is not just an experience to endure and &#147;<i>get
    through</i>&#148; with the false expectation that somehow, someway we will magically be
    different on the day we graduate.&nbsp; Rather, a college experience is a period of
    development in one&#146;s life to be prized and prospered.&nbsp; Indeed, simply settling
    for &#147;<i>getting&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><i>through</i>&#148; college is like buying an expensive car that
    has no engine.&nbsp; The car may look very good from the outside, but inside the real
    power is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Today as I refer to &#147;<i>diligence</i>&#148;
    and &#147;<i>competence</i>&#148; I am talking about conscientiously and consistently and
    constantly learning how to learn.&nbsp; I am talking about preparing your mind for the
    important and weighty responsibilities that shortly will come to you, and for which
    you&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />must be ready.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#000080"><u>Ricks College
    Mission Statement</u>&nbsp;</font></b><font color="#000080"> </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;The mission of Ricks College has four important and
      interrelated parts:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; Build testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ
      and encourage living its principles.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Provide a quality education for students of
      diverse interests and abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Prepare students for further education and
      employment, and for their roles as citizens and parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; 			</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp; Maintain a wholesome academic, cultural, social and
      spiritual environment.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please note that the first element of the
    mission statement, building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, relates to
    the <b><i>faithfulness</i></b> Elder Evans described.&nbsp; The second and third elements
    of the statement, which focus upon providing a quality education and preparing students
    for future responsibilities, relate to the <b><i>competence</i></b> he described.&nbsp;
    And the fourth element of the statement relates to the type of environment in which both 		<b><i>faithfulness</i></b>
    and <b><i>competence</i></b> can be cultivated.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A disciplined and educated mind is a tool for
    reasoning and inquiring and evaluating and discerning.&nbsp; These abilities are not
    merely the requirements described in a course syllabus; rather, they are essential skills
    for a spiritual, happy, and productive life.&nbsp; More importantly, the combination of
    spiritual strength and mental capacity provides the means whereby we can&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	<br />act for ourselves rather than be acted upon.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The men whom we sustain today as prophets,
    seers, and revelators are marvelous examples of both faithfulness and competence.&nbsp;
    Before his call to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Elder Russell M. Nelson was a world
    renowned heart surgeon.&nbsp; Elder Dallin H. Oaks was a respected lawyer, judge, and
    constitutional scholar.&nbsp; And Elder Richard G. Scott was a highly skilled engineer who
    played a key role in the development of the nuclear navy. The faith and diligence of these
    great men helped them become powerful servants and special witnesses of the Lord Jesus
    Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the scriptures, the words faith and
    diligence are used together in the same verse twelve times.&nbsp; In 1 Nephi 16:28 we
    learn that the directional pointers in the Liahona &#147;. . . did work according to the
    faith and diligence and heed which we did give unto them.&#148;&nbsp; In 1 Nephi 17:15 we
    note that Nephi &#147;. . . did strive to keep the commandments of the Lord, and I did
    exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence.&#148;&nbsp; And in D&amp;C 103:36 we
    recognize that &#147;. . . All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your
    diligence, faithfulness, and prayers of faith.&#148;&nbsp; Clearly, the integrated themes
    of faithfulness and diligence occur over and over in the scriptures.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now please turn with me to section four in the
    Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp; I want to draw your attention to verse two:&nbsp;
    &#147;Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all
    your heart, might, mind, and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last
    day.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, typically we would interpret <b><i>heart,
    might, mind,</i></b> and <b><i>strength</i></b> as four separate but interrelated factors
    that are required in the service of God.&nbsp; May I suggest an additional
    interpretation?&nbsp; Please consider the word &#147;<b><i>might</i></b>&#148; as
    descriptive of the &#147;<b><i>heart</i></b>.&#148;&nbsp; In other words, a 		<b>mighty
    heart</b> is required for serving God.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now also consider that the word &#147;<b><i>strength</i></b>&#148;
    as descriptive of the &#147;<b><i>mind</i></b>.&#148;&nbsp; Therefore, to effectively
    serve God we also must have a <b>strong mind.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Perhaps, then, another way of interpreting
    this verse is as follows:&nbsp; O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve
    him with a mighty heart, and with a strong mind, that ye may stand blameless before God at
    the last day.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The mighty heart equates to the faithfulness and
    spiritual strength described by Elder Evans.&nbsp; And the strong mind equates to
    competence achieved through intellectual diligence and discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me emphasize once again, as I talk about
    &#147;<b><i>diligence</i></b>&#148; and &#147;<b><i>competence</i></b>,&#148; I am not
    suggesting that one must be a Rhodes Scholar, or a straight A student, or an
    apostle.&nbsp; Rather, diligence implies a tenacious persistence about, an engagement in,
    and a love for the process of learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, each of you has a
    responsibility to yourself to become a diligent student as a means of personal preparation
    for the challenges and responsibilities that lie ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">You have a responsibility to your family to
    become a diligent student as an expression of your appreciation for and gratitude to
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">And most importantly, you have
    a responsibility to the Savior and His church to become a diligent student because of the
    covenants you already have made or will yet make&#151; particularly the covenants of
    sacrifice and consecration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>The Principles of
    Sacrifice and Consecration</u></b>&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">I now want to relate the responsibility that you and I have to be diligent in developing
    strong minds to the principles of sacrifice and consecration.&nbsp; Let me briefly
    describe each of these principles.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080">&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <b><font color="#000080">Sacrifice</font></b><font color="#000080"> &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">The word sacrifice means &#147;to offer or surrender
    something valuable or precious.&#148;&nbsp; The Prophet Joseph Smith provides the most
    clear and concise explanation of the importance of the law of sacrifice in the 		<u>Lectures
    on Faith</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>For a man to lay down his all, his character
      and reputation, his honor, and applause, his good name among men, his houses, his lands,
      his brothers and sisters, his wife and children, and even his own life also&#151;counting
      all things but filth and dross for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus
      Christ&#151;requires more than mere belief or supposition that he is doing the will of
      God; but actual knowledge, realizing that, when those sufferings are ended, he will enter
      into eternal rest, and be a partaker of the glory of God.&nbsp;&nbsp; 			</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let us here observe, that a religion that does
      not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith
      necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith
      necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the
      sacrifice of all earthly things.&nbsp; It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that
      God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is through the medium of the
      sacrifice of all earthly things that men do actually know that they are doing the things
      that are well pleasing in the sight of God.&nbsp; (<u>Lectures on Faith</u>, Lecture 6,
      pg. 57-58)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Bruce R. McConkie has taught that
    sacrifice pertains only to mortality.&nbsp; In the eternal sense, there is really no such
    thing as sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>Sacrifice involves giving up the things of
      this world because of the promises of blessings to be gained in a better world.&nbsp; In
      the eternal perspective there is no sacrifice in giving up all things&#151;even including
      the laying down of one's life&#151;if eternal life is gained through such a course.&nbsp;
      (<u>Mormon Doctrine</u>, pg. 664)&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In summary then, the principle of sacrifice
    requires us to willingly offer anything and everything that we possess for the sake of the
    gospel of the Savior&#151;including our character and reputation; our honor and applause;
    our good name among men; our houses, our lands, and even our families; all things,
    including our very lives if need be.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our pledge is:&nbsp; I will give all that I
    possess, and I am willing to die, if need be, for the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacrifice is motivated by faith and hope and
    produces increased commitment and a desire to obey.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Spencer W. Kimball vividly describes
    how he, as a very young boy, began to learn about the principle of sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p>When I was a little boy about four years old,
      my father had gone to work on Monday morning and my mother took my brothers and sisters
      and myself to&nbsp; see the bishop.&nbsp; (You see, my mother had eleven children.)&nbsp;
      There were about four or five that were not in school, so Monday morning we started out on
      the road with two buckets of eggs.&nbsp; I was like many other little boys, I could
      ask&nbsp; many questions, and I said:&nbsp; &quot;Where are we going, Ma?&quot; and she
      said, &quot;We are going to the bishop's,&quot; and I said, &quot;Why are we going to the
      bishop's?&quot; &quot;These are tithing eggs,&quot; she said.&nbsp; Then I said, &quot;Ma,
      what is tithing?&quot;&nbsp; And then she explained, &quot;Every time we take ten eggs out
      of the nest, we put one in a special bucket.&nbsp; The other nine we take to the store to
      buy clothes and food with and so these eggs in this special bucket keep increasing until
      we have a bucket full. And then every week we take them to the bishop and he gives us a
      receipt showing that we have paid our tithing.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then, when I was a little bigger boy, I used
      to put up hay.&nbsp; I would drive the horses that were hitched to the wagon and tramp the
      hay down and my older brothers pitched it on the wagon, and when we had gone to the field
      in the morning, my father would say, &quot;Now, boys, this is the tenth load this morning.
      This belongs to the Lord.&nbsp; You go up into the upper part where the hay is the best
      and get a big load and then take it over to the big barn in which the bishop keeps the
      Church hay.&quot;&nbsp; In that way I learned how to pay tithing, so it isn't hard for me
      to obey this law.&nbsp; (<u>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</u>, p. 341)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are all familiar with many other stories
    about farmers who offered their best grain, best produce, or finest animals to the bishop
    as their tithing.&nbsp; <u>And only their best was good enough for the Lord</u>.&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Tithing is but one application of
    the principle of sacrifice.&nbsp; Today, we do not typically pay our tithing with such
    donations-in-kind.&nbsp; Rather, we readily use our cash to pay our tithes and
    offerings.&nbsp; And most of us would willingly and gladly offer up anything that was
    required of us, including our snowboards, golf clubs, CD players, and our year&#146;s
    supply of Ramen&nbsp;noodles.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Consecration</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;		</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Consecration is related to but different from
    sacrifice.&nbsp; The word consecrate means to develop and &#147;<i>dedicate to a sacred
    purpose</i>.&#148;&nbsp; Sacrifice is what I will offer, surrender, yield, or give
    up.&nbsp; Consecration, on the other hand, is to fully develop and dedicate to a sacred
    purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please listen to the following description of
    the principle of consecration provided by President Ezra Taft Benson:&nbsp; &#147;We
    covenant to live the law of consecration.&nbsp; This law is that we consecrate our time,
    talents, strength, property, and money for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God on this
    earth and the establishment of Zion (<u>Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson</u>, p. 121).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we live the law of consecration, we are
    willing not only to offer anything and everything we possess for the sake of the gospel,
    but we also promise to develop and devote our best selves&#151;our time, talents, and
    strength&#151;to the building of the kingdom of God on the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our pledge is:&nbsp; I will give me and all
    that I can become, and I will live for the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The principle of sacrifice is a lesser law
    preparation for the principle of consecration. Consecration includes and encompasses
    sacrifice and much more.&nbsp; We are not only willing to offer up our possessions, but we
    will become the best we can be and assist however possible in building the kingdom in
    righteous ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We will not only die for the gospel, but we
    will develop ourselves and live for the gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">True consecration is motivated by charity and
    produces an increased desire to serve.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">The best application of the
    principle of consecration that I can think of, being developed and dedicated to a sacred
    purpose, is motherhood.&nbsp; Over the past 24 years I have watched my wife, a very
    talented, capable, and competent woman, as she has developed and dedicated herself to the
    holy purposes of our home.&nbsp; Some would say she has sacrificed or given up much to
    become the heart of our home and to rear and nurture our children.&nbsp; She has not given
    up anything; rather, she has been dedicated and consecrated to a holy purpose.&nbsp; She
    has developed herself and applied those skills as God has directed in the most important
    undertaking of a lifetime, which is the rearing and nurturing of children.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p align="center"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sacrifice and
    Consecration</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">May I suggest, brothers and sisters, that in these
    latter days much more is required of us as children of the covenant than our money and
    substance.&nbsp; As the Church spreads throughout the world in a rapidly changing and
    complex information age, may I suggest that we must consecrate unto the Lord both a
    faithful heart and a <b>strong mind</b>&#151;a mind capable of learning and instruction
    and discipline and receiving revelation.&nbsp; <u>And only our best is good&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;
    	<br /><u>enough for the Lord</u>.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In my devotional address last year at the
    beginning of the fall semester, I indicated that attending Ricks College is both a
    privilege and a responsibility.&nbsp; Sacred tithing funds make it possible for you to be
    here, and the price you pay for tuition and fees is only a small percentage of the actual
    cost of your educational experience at Ricks.&nbsp; Literally, the widow&#146;s mite,
    contributed from faithful Church members around the world, makes it possible for you
    to&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />be here.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please turn with me in the Book of Mormon to
    Omni 1:26.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye
      should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and
      the power of his redemption.&nbsp; Yea, come unto him, and <b>offer your whole souls as an
      offering unto him</b>, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as
      the Lord liveth ye will be saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As a student at Ricks College, you have been
    provided with a stewardship opportunity and responsibility to develop a mighty heart and a
    strong mind&#151;to become both faithful and competent as Elder Evans described&#151;in
    preparation for that day when you can offer your whole souls unto Him.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Marion G. Romney has taught:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p>Can we see how critical self-reliance becomes
      when looked upon as the prerequisite to service, when we also know service is what Godhood
      is all about?&nbsp; Without self-reliance one cannot exercise these innate desires to
      serve. How can we give if there is nothing there?&nbsp; Food for the hungry cannot come
      from empty shelves.&nbsp; Money to assist the needy cannot come from an empty purse.&nbsp;
      Support and understanding cannot come from the emotionally starved.&nbsp; Teaching cannot
      come from the unlearned.&nbsp; And most important of all, spiritual&nbsp; guidance cannot
      come from the spiritually weak.&nbsp; (<u>Conference Report</u>, October 1982, pg.
      135)&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">My dear young brothers and sisters, what will
    you and I be prepared to offer unto God? Will you and I offer a mighty heart and strong
    mind, indeed, our whole soul, unto God? Please consider that during your time at Ricks
    College you are preparing &#147;<i>here and now</i>&#148; for the consecrated offering you
    will place upon the altar &#147;<i>there and then</i>.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I began my remarks today, I told you I
    would talk to you and treat you like who you are.&nbsp; Indeed you are a special
    generation.&nbsp; You live upon the earth at a remarkable and challenging time.&nbsp; And
    you must remember that &#147;. . . of him unto whom much is given much is required&#148;
    (D&amp;C 82:3).&nbsp; Now is a season of preparation in your life.&nbsp; Please use your
    time at Ricks College to become both faithful and competent, to develop a mighty heart and
    a strong mind.&nbsp; The scriptural warning directed to slothful servants who must be
    commanded in all things applies to both spiritual and school work.&nbsp; As students at
    Ricks College, we should be anxiously engaged in the process of learning and do many
    things of our own free will.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Remember the promise of Elder Evans:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	</font></p>
<p>When young people can acquire the skills, the
      techniques, and the knowledge of these times, and along with it have a spiritual
      commitment and a solid faith and cleanliness of life, there is nothing that you can&#146;t
      achieve; nothing in righteousness or in reason.&nbsp; (From an address given to the young
      people at the Northwest Inland Division Gathered for Zion&#146;s Camp, October 15, 1971)</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I testify that God lives.&nbsp; I witness that
    Jesus is the Christ and the Redeemer of the world.&nbsp; And I know that the fullness of
    the gospel was restored to the earth in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph
    Smith.&nbsp; Indeed there are living apostles and prophets on the earth today.&nbsp; The
    Savior directs the affairs of His church through a living prophet, even Gordon B.
    Hinckley.&nbsp; Of these things I testify and declare my witness, in the name of Jesus
    Christ, amen.</font></p>

<font color="#004040" size="2">© 1999 by Ricks College. All rights reserved</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Good morning, brothers and sisters, and welcome to our Ricks
    College Campus Education Week. Sister Bednar and I are delighted to be with you.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">I pray for and invite the Spirit of the Lord to be with each of
    us today, that we may truly understand one another and be edified and rejoice together
    (D&amp;C 50:22).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">During my remarks this morning, I will refer to a significant
    number of scriptures&#151; many more than we could possibly read together in the allotted
    devotional time. Some of the references I will specifically ask you to look up in your
    scriptures and read along with me; other verses I will quote directly and provide only the
    reference. For your convenience a number of scriptures and key concepts will be projected
    on the large screen directly above me. In addition, a handout sheet detailing all of the
    scriptural references I will use can be picked up at the conclusion of today&#146;s
    devotional. You may find it helpful to study the quoted verses in more detail at a later
    time.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">As Susan mentioned, the theme for our Campus Education Week this
    year is taken from Proverbs chapter 16 verse 22: &quot;Understanding is a wellspring of
    life . . .&quot; For some time I have been thinking about and working to understand the
    scriptural meaning of the word understanding. Today I would like to address two
    fundamental questions related to this important concept: (1) What is the scriptural
    meaning of understanding, and (2) what key principles are related to understanding?</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Question #1 &#151; What is the scriptural meaning of
    understanding?</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">In the scriptures, understanding is frequently linked to and
    associated with both knowledge and wisdom. For example, Exodus chapter 31 verse 3
    describes an inspired artisan who helped to build and furnish the tabernacle.</font> </p>
<p>And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
      in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship.</p>
<p><font color="#004040">In Proverbs chapter 4 verse 7 we read:</font> </p>
<p>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
      all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p><font color="#004040">In Proverbs chapter 9 verse 10 we learn:</font> </p>
<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the
      knowledge of the holy is understanding.</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Job asks in chapter 28 verse 12:</font> </p>
<p>But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of
      understanding?</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Job then provides an inspired answer to his own question in verse
    28:</font> </p>
<p>And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is
      wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Mormon, as he finishes his record, indicates that he writes . . .</font>
</p>
<p>. . .<i> according to the knowledge and understanding which God
      has given me</i>. (Words of Mormon 1:9)</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Clearly, understanding cannot be understood apart from knowledge
    and wisdom.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Interestingly, understanding is also commonly described in the
    scriptures in relation to the heart. For example:</font> </p>
<p>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given
      understanding to the heart?<font color="#004000">(Job 38:36)</font></p>
<p>My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
      shall be of understanding.<font color="#004000">(Psalms 49:3)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
      heart to understanding</font></i><font color="#004000">. (Proverbs 2:2)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore,
      ye have not been wise</font></i><font color="#004000">. (Mosiah 12:27)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">. . . but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears
      that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the
      mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view</font>.</i><font color="#004000"> (Mosiah
      2:9)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their
      hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed</font>.</i><font color="#004000"> (3 Nephi 19:33)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">You may now be asking yourself, Elder Bednar, what is the point?
    What are the relationships among knowledge, understanding, and wisdom? And why in the
    scriptures is understanding frequently associated with the heart? Let me try to briefly
    explain.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Knowledge typically is the foundation of understanding. We use
    our minds and our intellect, our experience, and the process of reasoning to acquire
    information, to analyze facts, to recognize patterns and relationships, and to summarize
    what we have learned and know about people, places, and events. As we learn in the
    ninety-third section of the Doctrine and Covenants, &quot;Truth is knowledge of things as
    they are, and as they were, and as they are to come&quot; (verse 24; emphasis added).
    Knowledge in and of itself does not guarantee understanding, but understanding cannot be
    obtained without knowledge.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Understanding is built upon knowledge and precedes wisdom. As
    described in the scriptures, we use our hearts and the process of revelation to obtain a
    confirming spiritual witness concerning the truth of what we have come to know. In and
    through our hearts the Holy Ghost certifies more completely and helps us to feel deeply
    the truth of what we have come to know intellectually. Understanding grows out of
    knowledge that is certified as true by the Holy Ghost and produces an illumination, a
    comprehension, a perspective, and a depth of desire and commitment not obtainable through
    reason alone. As President Harold B. Lee frequently taught, &quot;When your heart begins
    to tell you things that your mind does not know, then you are getting the spirit of the
    Lord&quot; (<u>New Era</u>, February 1971, pg. 3).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Please turn with me in the Book of Mormon to 1 Nephi 17. Here we
    find a classic example of the relationship between knowledge acquired through the mind and
    understanding obtained in the heart. You will recall that Nephi was commanded to build a
    ship, and in this chapter we learn about Laman and Lemuel&#146;s lack of faith and their
    opposition to and murmuring about that particular task. Nephi exhorts his brethren and
    highlights in verse 45 the importance of both reason and revelation.</font> </p>
<p>Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your
      God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time
      to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling,
      that ye could not feel his words . . . .</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Certainly, Laman and Lemuel had received knowledge about the
    purpose and importance of their journey in the wilderness&#151;from loving parents, from
    Nephi, and even from an angel of the Lord. But apparently they had not &quot; . . .
    applied their hearts to understanding . . .&quot; (Mosiah 12:27), they had not received
    confirming revelations, and they did not feel the truthfulness of Nephi&#146;s words.
    Therefore they were not wise.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Wisdom is the application of understanding in righteous judgment
    and action. It is the precious fruit that is nourished by knowledge and reason and
    understanding and revelation. Please notice in the following verses how understanding
    leads to righteous action.</font> </p>
<p>. . . <i>but a man of understanding walketh uprightly</i>.
      (Proverbs 15:21) </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
      observe it with my whole heart</font>. </i><font color="#004000">(Psalms 119:34)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
      every false way</font>. </i><font color="#004000">(Psalms 119:104)</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">. . . <i>they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for
      they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently,
      that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to
      much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of
      revelation, and when they taught they taught with power and authority of God</i>. (Alma
      17:2-3)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Wisdom is always linked to righteousness. Recall in the New
    Testament the challenge to the sons of Sceva as they attempted to cast out evil spirits
    without proper authority.</font> </p>
<p>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
      I know; but who are ye? <font color="#004000">(Acts 19:15; emphasis added)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Even the devils know. But they do not understand, and they
    certainly are not wise.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Obviously the relationships among knowledge, understanding, and
    wisdom can be more complex than my simple graphics might suggest. However, the definitions
    and relationships we have discussed thus far this morning do provide a good beginning
    point in our effort to better comprehend these important concepts.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Question #2 &#151; What key principles are related to
    understanding?</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">I would now like to discuss three key principles that are related
    to understanding. I believe these principles can help each of us as we seek to better
    understand understanding.</font> <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    &nbsp; </p>
<p><u><font color="#004040">Principle #1 &#151; Understanding is a gift from God.</font></u>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">May I suggest that understanding is not a characteristic or
    virtue we can jot down on our goal sheet or &quot;to do&quot; list, to be accomplished by
    the end of the month. Rather, understanding, in the scriptural sense that we have
    discussed this morning, is a gift from God. Please note the source of understanding in
    each of the following verses.</font> </p>
<p>But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
      Almighty giveth them understanding.<font color="#004000"> (Job 32:8)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
      and understanding</font>. </i><font color="#004000">(Proverbs 2:6)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in
      all things</font>. </i><font color="#004000">(2 Timothy 2:7)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he
      speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding</font>.</i><font color="#004000"> (2 Nephi 31:3)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my
      words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time. Therefore, go ye
      unto your homes, and ponder the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my
      name, that ye may understand </font></i><font color="#004000">. . . . (3 Nephi 17:2-3)</font>
</p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the
      Spirit manifesteth truth.</font></i><font color="#004000"> (D&amp;C 91:4)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that
      he that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the
      Spirit of truth? Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one
      another, and both are edified, and rejoice together</font>.</i><font color="#004000">
      (D&amp;C 50:21-22)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">It is important for all of us to remember that spiritual
    understanding is a gift to be received and not a trait or characteristic to be developed.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now please turn with me to section 68 in the Doctrine and
    Covenants. Perhaps we will look at verses 25-26 a bit differently given what we have
    learned about understanding as a gift from God.</font> </p>
<p>And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in
      any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of
      repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the
      Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands when either years old, the sin be upon the heads
      of the parents.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in
      any of her stakes which are organized</font>.</i></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Please note in verse 25 that parents are not simply to teach
    their children. Rather, they are to teach them to understand. And understanding is a gift
    from God.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">I believe, brothers and sisters, that these verses in section 68
    are a powerful admonition for parents to create a home wherein the Spirit of the Lord can
    reside. Within a Christ-centered home, love, trust, and confidence invite the presence of
    the Holy Ghost. In such a home the Holy Ghost can teach children to understand.
    Ultimately, it is not parents who do the teaching. Certainly, parents must diligently and
    effectively explain basic gospel doctrines, teach true principles, and share sacred
    experiences. But who truly does the teaching and certifies the truthfulness of what we
    come to know? The Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead. He is the Comforter who
    knows all things. He is thereby able to search the minds and hearts of all of us and then
    tailor a blessing to us, according to our individual needs and circumstances. And it is
    teaching and certifying by the Spirit that produces understanding. Parents in Zion have
    the responsibility to establish and maintain that type of Christ-centered and
    spirit-filled home.</font> <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    &nbsp; </p>
<p><u><font color="#004040">Principle #2 &#151; Hardness of heart hinders understanding.</font></u>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">The scriptures are replete with references to the relationship
    between a hard heart and a lack of understanding.</font> </p>
<p>They have not known or understood: for he hath shut their
      eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand. <font color="#004000">(Isaiah 44:18)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that
      they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted,
      and I should heal them</font></i><font color="#004000">. (John 12:40)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if you cannot
      understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not
      brought into the light, but must perish in the dark</font></i><font color="#004000">. (2
      Nephi 32:4)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine
      utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the
      ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, or
      understand great knowledge, when it is given to them in plainness, even as plain as word
      can be</font></i><font color="#004000">. (2 Nephi 32:7)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">And now because of their unbelief they could not understand
      the word of God; and their hearts were hardened</font>.</i><font color="#004000"> (Mosiah
      26:3)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many
      times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know</font>
      . . . . </i><font color="#004000">(Alma 10:6)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">But few understood the meaning of those things, and this
      because of the hardness of their hearts</font></i><font color="#004000">. (Alma 33:20)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Now many of us may tend to think that a hard heart is the result
    of serious transgression and gross wickedness. Certainly that is true. But I wonder if you
    and I, as Latter-day Saints who are striving to be committed and active, might not also be
    subject to a more subtle and seductive type of hard-heartedness?</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">In February of this year, the First Presidency issued a letter
    that was to be read in sacrament meeting in every ward and distributed to every home in
    the Church. I now quote two paragraphs from that First Presidency letter:</font> </p>
<p>We call upon parents to devote their best efforts to the
      teaching and rearing of their children in gospel principles which will keep them close to
      the Church. The home is the basis of a righteous life, and no other instrumentality can
      take its place or fulfill its essential functions in carrying forward this God-given
      responsibility. </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">We counsel parents and children to give highest priority to
      family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family
      activities. However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be, they must
      not be permitted to displace the divinely appointed duties that only parents and family
      can adequately perform</font>. </i><font color="#004000">(First Presidency letter, 11
      February 1999)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">How have you and I responded to this counsel from prophets of God
    who have been divinely appointed &quot;to guide us in these latter days&quot;? I
    personally am aware of stakes and wards wherein the response of some members basically has
    been &quot;this is not new, we&#146;ve heard this same counsel before,&quot; and the
    inspired instruction has not been taken seriously and even casually discarded. Do we hear
    but fail to understand? Have we, like Amulek in the Book of Mormon, been called many times
    but refuse to hear? Do we know concerning these things, yet we would not know? Have we
    indeed applied our hearts to understanding both the content and timing of this admonition
    from modern prophets? Do the pace and comfort of our life-style produce a type of
    hard-heartedness that hinders our understanding. I am persuaded that two of the greatest
    sins of our busy and hectic generation are distraction and preoccupation. Clearly, if we
    have failed to understand and act upon this recent counsel from the First Presidency, we
    are lacking in wisdom.</font> <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    &nbsp; </p>
<p><u><font color="#004040">Principle #3 &#151; Understanding brings great blessings.</font></u>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">The blessings associated with understanding are marvelous
    indeed.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
      understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.<font color="#004000"> (Proverbs
      1:5)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge</font></i><font color="#004000">. . . . (Proverbs 15:14)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
      understanding</font></i><font color="#004000">. (Proverbs 3:13)</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="#004040">And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach
      to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of
      the prudent shall come to naught</font></i><font color="#004000">. (D&amp;C 76:9)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004040">Thus, three of the specific blessings of understanding are (1) an
    increasing desire for additional knowledge, instruction, and learning; (2) happiness; and
    (3) a precious perspective of the eternal that transcends the limited view of the mortal.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">Let me provide just one brief example of the blessings that come
    from understanding. Susan and I recently traveled to Arkansas to attend the funeral of a
    dear friend named Kirk who died suddenly and unexpectedly. We first met Kirk and his wife
    Carol when our family moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, in 1980. Kirk was serving at that
    time as a counselor in the bishopric. I have fond memories of the very first Sunday we
    attended church in Fayetteville and the warm invitation we received from Kirk and Carol to
    come to their home for dessert. That Sunday afternoon marked the beginning of a strong
    friendship. We worked and played together often, and we were next-door neighbors for more
    than ten years.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Kirk and Carol recently were traveling together in China on a
    business trip when he had a massive heart attack. His sudden passing was a shock to all of
    us who knew him. The blessings of perspective and of spiritual strength that derive from a
    true understanding of the plan of salvation are perhaps most evident when we stand at the
    doorway of death. The peace and steadiness that we observed in Carol and other family
    members are clearly blessings that grow out of the gift of understanding. This good and
    faithful woman knows and understands we are born to die and we die to live. Carol knows
    and understands that death is only a temporary separation from her beloved husband and not
    the permanent end of a relationship. Because of what she knows and understands, she has
    hope for a glorious resurrection and reunion with Kirk. In moments of our greatest sadness
    and loneliness, an understanding of the gospel plan and sacred covenants provide a
    &quot;peace . . . which passeth all understanding&quot; (Philippians 4:7).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Brothers and sisters, we learn in the Book of Mormon that King
    Benjamin had three sons. These three young men were taught in the language of their
    fathers that &quot; . . . thereby they might become men of understanding . . .&quot;
    (Mosiah 1:2). My prayer for all of us this morning is that we likewise may become men and
    women of understanding.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Clearly we are all at different stages in the process of
    receiving understanding from God. And like many blessings, understanding is received
    gradually, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. Over
    time, however, the promised blessing is sure as we work and apply our hearts to
    understanding.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Let me now conclude with three brief examples of how
    understanding is built upon the foundation of knowledge and leads to wisdom and righteous
    application.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">A mature couple recently submitted their papers in anticipation
    of serving another mission, their third full-time mission since retirement. This couple
    returns home from the mission field just long enough to get their personal affairs in
    order, to hug and kiss the grandchildren for a while, and then they return to the mission
    field. This man and woman have heard the Brethren on repeated occasions describe the
    urgent need for more mature missionary couples throughout the world. They know and
    understand who they are and why they are here, they understand the covenants they have
    made in sacred places, and they respond righteously and wisely to the call to serve.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#004040">A young couple expecting their first child wisely chooses a more
    modest life-style so the mother can discontinue her employment and devote her full time
    and attention to the family and home. This young man and woman have studied diligently and
    know the teachings of living prophets about the respective roles and responsibilities of
    men and women, particularly as contained in the <i>Proclamation on the Family</i>. As this
    young couple has sensitively worked together to establish proper priorities and discern
    the difference between needs and wants, they have been blessed with understanding. They
    know, they have been blessed to understand, and they are acting and responding with
    wisdom.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">A young man excitedly enters the MTC in Provo. He has read the
    Book of Mormon on his own and with his family. He has a developing testimony that Jesus is
    the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. He is anxious to share the message of the restoration
    with those who are not members of the Church. He is clean and pure. This young man did not
    need to make significant or last-minute changes to his hairstyle, to his preferred music,
    or to his manner of speech. This young man knows, he understands, and he has been
    preparing and responding with wisdom.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#004040">Brothers and sisters, may we indeed become men and women of
    understanding. The principles we have reviewed this morning are true. I testify that God
    lives and that He does indeed bless us with understanding. I witness that Jesus is the
    Christ. And I know that the Holy Ghost is real and can enlighten our minds and certify to
    our hearts the truth of things that matter most. The fullness of the gospel has been
    restored to the earth in these latter days, of which I testify and declare my witness in
    the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, it is a pleasure and a privilege
      for me to welcome you to a new semester and academic year at Ricks College. To students,
      faculty, and staff, both new and returning, welcome. We are delighted you are here at
      Ricks.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The message I hope to communicate this afternoon is an important
      one. I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to be with each of us today, that we may truly
      understand one another and be edified and rejoice together (D&amp;C 50:22).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please have your scriptures ready to use. Today I will refer to a
      number of scriptures&#151;many more than we could possibly look up and read together in
      the allotted devotional time. Some of the references I will specifically ask you to look
      up in your scriptures and read along with me; other verses I will quote directly and
      provide only the reference. You may find it helpful to jot down the references and study
      the quoted verses in more detail at a later time. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sister Bednar and I love to meet and associate with the students
      of Ricks College. On the weekends when I do not have an assignment to fulfill in
      connection with my service in the Quorum of the Seventy, Susan and I frequently go
      tracting in the dorms and apartment complexes. We enjoy knocking on doors, introducing
      ourselves to a group of students, and spending a few minutes getting acquainted and asking
      questions. We also like to visit with students as we run laps at the football stadium or
      in the Hart Building. And on most</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Monday nights Sister Bednar and I host family home evening for
      approximately 100 of you students. Typically we sing an opening hymn, pray, and then we
      invite the students to ask gospel questions or to identify topics they would like to
      discuss. We conclude with a benediction and lots of ice cream.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Susan and I have been meeting with groups of students every
      Monday night since we moved to Rexburg in the summer of 1997. Most of the questions
      students ask are both insightful and instructive, and we have learned a great deal about
      you through the questions you have asked. Let me share with you just a few of the most
      commonly asked questions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; Elder and Sister Bednar, please tell us how you
        obtained your testimonies. What do you do to strengthen your testimonies?			<br /><br />&#149; Elder Bednar, what have you learned working with President Hinckley?			</font><br /><font color="#000080"><br />&#149; What advice or counsel do you have for us as future wives and mothers and husbands
        and fathers?<br /><br />&#149; How do you know when you have met the right one?<br /> <br />&#149; What is your favorite scripture?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Today I want to address the one question that is asked most
      frequently by the students with whom we meet. In fact, during the entire time we have been
      holding family home evenings with students, I cannot remember a single time when some
      version of this question was not asked. Here&#146;s the question: &quot;<i>Elder and
      Sister Bednar, how can I tell the difference between my emotions telling me what I want to
      hear and the Holy Ghost telling me what I need to hear?&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, I certainly do not presume to have a complete or perfect
      answer to this question. But I would like to discuss with you some of the things I have
      learned about receiving, recognizing, and responding to the influence of the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">The Doctrine of the Godhead</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The beginning of the answer to this important question is found
      in a correct understanding of the nature of the Godhead. The first Article of Faith
      states: &quot;We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and in
      the Holy Ghost.&quot; It is important to remember the simple but profound truth that the
      Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings. In this
      dispensation, the Prophet Joseph Smith came to understand this fundamental and powerful
      doctrine in the Sacred Grove in 1820, and he boldly proclaimed the true nature of God
      throughout his mortal ministry. As Joseph taught, &quot;<i>If men do not comprehend the
      nature of God, they do not comprehend themselves</i>&quot; (<u>Teachings of the Prophet
      Joseph Smith</u>, pg. 343).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please turn with me to Section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants.
      I want to draw your attention to verses 21 and 22. </font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as
        man&#146;s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a
        personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thus, the three members of the Godhead are separate beings who
      are perfectly united in one overarching purpose, which is to bring to pass the immortality
      and eternal life of man (Moses&nbsp;1:39). I testify that God, indeed, is our Eternal
      Father; we literally are His spirit children. He and His Beloved Son know, are concerned
      about, and love each one of us. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit who bears witness to the
      truth. The Holy Ghost also is referred to in the scriptures as the <b>Comforter</b> (John
      14:16-27, Moroni 8:26), a <b>Teacher</b> (John 14:26; D&amp;C 50:14), and a 		<b>Revelator</b>
      (2 Nephi 32:5). It is through the Holy Ghost that the revelations of the Father and the
      Son are given. The Holy Ghost is the witness of, the messenger for, and the testifier of
      the Father and the Son.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Given these fundamental truths, consider then that prayer is the
      process whereby we as sons and daughters communicate with our Heavenly Father. We are
      counseled to pray to the Father in the name of the Son by the power of the Holy Ghost.
      Revelation is the process whereby our Heavenly Father communicates with us. Remember, it
      is through the Holy Ghost that the revelations of the Father and the Son are conveyed to
      men and women here upon the earth.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Revelations or messages from the Eternal Father to his children
      can come in many ways, including, for example, visitations, visions, and dreams. However,
      it is important to note that in the scriptures the influence of the Holy Ghost is
      frequently described as &quot;. . . a <i>still small voice . . .</i>&quot; (3 Nephi 11:3;
      1 Kings 19:12) and a &quot;. . . <i>voice of perfect mildness</i> . . .&quot; (Helaman
      5:30). The influence of the Holy Ghost is gentle, tender, and delicate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please turn with me now to Section 8 of the Doctrine and
      Covenants. Section 8 is a revelation given to Oliver Cowdery through the Prophet Joseph
      Smith during the work of translating the Book of Mormon. Verses two and three describe the
      spiritual gift of revelation and the process whereby this gift typically occurs.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart,
        by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now,
        behold, this is the spirit of revelation . . .</i> .</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">These verses teach us that revelation from our Father, 		<u>in its
      most familiar form</u>, comes through the Holy Ghost as thoughts to our minds and feelings
      to our hearts. Thus, God communicates with us through our very thoughts and feelings! It
      should not be hard to understand why we are counseled to avoid polluting our minds with
      pornography, watching R-rated and inappropriate movies and television programs, and taking
      into our bodies harmful and addictive substances such as drugs and alcohol. These tools of
      the Adversary can restrict and eventually destroy our ability to recognize and respond to the
      promptings of the Holy Ghost. As President Boyd K. Packer has explained:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>These delicate, refined spiritual communications are not seen
        with our eyes nor heard with our ears. And even though it is described as a voice, it is a
        voice that one feels more than one hears . . . . The Spirit does not get our attention by
        shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather, it whispers. It caresses so gently that
        if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all</i>. (Boyd K. Packer, &quot;<i>The Candle
        of the Lord</i>,&quot; in <u>That All May Be Edified</u>, pg. 335-336)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now I need your help for a brief demonstration. In my hand I am
      holding a tuning fork. As many of you know, a tuning fork provides a constant standard or
      pitch to which a musical instrument is tuned. Please be just as quiet as you can and
      listen for a moment. Just like the sound produced by this tuning fork, the Holy Ghost is
      constant, steady, and sure. The sound is not brash like the crashing of cymbals; it is not
      loud like the sound of a trumpet. It is subtle and subdued; it whispers and beckons in
      softness. And you and I must tune the strings of our souls to the standard of the Holy
      Ghost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have wondered if we as members of the Church talk about and
      emphasize marvelous, magnificent, and dramatic spiritual manifestations so often that we
      perhaps overlook the customary influence of the Holy Ghost that is quiet, delicate, and
      subtle. President Packer also has taught:</font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences
        do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally for our own
        edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are called by proper authority to do
        so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others. </font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually
        talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only
        when the Spirit itself prompts us to use them to the blessing of others.</font><font color="#000080"> (Boyd K.
        Packer, &quot;<i>The Candle of the Lord</i>,&quot; in <u>That All May Be Edified</u>,
        pg.&nbsp;337)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, brothers and sisters, in my ministry I have talked with many
      young people who, because they have not had a personal interview with the angel Moroni or
      some other miraculous manifestation, question the strength of their own testimony and
      spiritual capacity. If you have had similar thoughts or doubts, please know that you are
      normal and everything is &quot;<i>ok</i>.&quot; Such concerns are usually made worse by
      friends or associates or classmates who do not know about or do not follow President
      Packer&#146;s advice and talk unwisely about purported spiritual experiences. Please
      remember this important principle: <b>People who have profound spiritual experiences do
      not talk about them, except in the rarest of circumstances. </b>It would be a good thing
      for you to consider the implications of that principle.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Consider this counsel from President Joseph F. Smith:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>Show me Latter-day Saints who have to feed upon miracles,
        signs, and visions in order to keep them steadfast in the Church, and I will show you
        members of the Church who are not in good standing before God, and who are walking in
        slippery paths. It is not by marvelous manifestations unto us that we shall be established
        in the truth, but it is by humility, and faithful obedience to the commandments and laws
        of God</i>. (Joseph F. Smith, <u>Gospel Doctrine</u>, pg. 7)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Your simple, faithful obedience and dedication are the surest
      indicators of your spiritual capacity. Just keep moving forward with faith in the Savior,
      and you will be fine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, brothers and sisters, in the world today there are many
      deceptive and counterfeit tones that imitate the true sound and standard of this tuning
      fork. For example, I wonder if we sometimes too easily mistake personal sentiment and
      spiritual sensationalism for the promptings of the Holy Ghost. If we are not careful and
      discerning, we may mistakenly follow a false sound that will lead us astray. As the
      Prophet Joseph Smith taught, &quot;. . . <i>For nothing is a greater injury to the
      children of men than to be under the influence of a false spirit when they think they have
      the Spirit of God</i>&quot; (<u>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, pg. 205).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Because the Holy Ghost typically uses our minds and our hearts to
      convey spiritual messages, it can sometimes be difficult to discern the difference between
      our own thoughts and feelings and those communicated from our Heavenly Father. May I now
      suggest four principles that can help us to receive, recognize, and respond to the Holy
      Ghost in our daily lives.</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">Principle #1 &#151; We must desire the
      companionship of the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Simply stated, we must desire, yearn for, and seek the
      companionship of the Holy Ghost. Please turn with me to 3 Nephi 19:6-9:</font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did
        cause that the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the earth, and should pray
        unto the Father in the name of Jesus. </font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And the disciples did pray unto the Father also in the name of
        Jesus. And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And when they had ministered those same words which Jesus had
        spoken&#151;nothing varying from the words which Jesus had spoken&#151;behold, they knelt
        again and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they
        desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do you and I likewise remember to pray, both morning and night,
      for that which we should most desire, even the Holy Ghost? Or do we get caught up in the
      routine of daily living and the cares of the world and neglect this most valuable of all
      gifts. Receiving, recognizing, and responding to the Holy Ghost starts with our sincere
      and constant desire for His companionship and influence in our lives.</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">Principle #2 &#151; We must invite the
      companionship of the Holy Ghost</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We receive more readily and recognize more clearly the influence
      of the Holy Ghost as we specifically invite Him into our lives. Please turn with me to
      Section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants and note verse 14: <i>&quot;And the spirit shall
      be given unto you by the prayer of faith&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Section 63 verse 64 we are instructed: &quot;<i>Remember that
      that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of
      the Spirit; and in this there is no condemnation, and ye receive the Spirit through prayer
      . . . .&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We cannot compel or coerce or command the Holy Ghost. We must
      invite Him into our lives with the same gentleness and tenderness by which He influences
      us. Frankly, I am bothered by frequently repeated language that suggests we can &quot;<i>call
      down the powers of heaven</i>.&quot; Certainly we can invite such power, but I would never
      suggest we can <i>&quot;call it down</i>&quot; according to our will and timing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our invitations for the companionship of the Holy Ghost can occur
      in many ways. We invite the Holy Ghost into our lives through the making and keeping of
      sacred covenants. Meaningful personal prayer every morning and every night invites the
      Holy Ghost into our lives. Searching the scriptures daily and diligently invites the Holy
      Ghost into our lives. Sincere worship in our homes and at Church invites the Holy Ghost
      into our lives. Appropriateness in our relationships with family members and friends
      invites the Holy Ghost into our lives. Virtuous thoughts and actions and language and
      dress invite the Holy Ghost into our lives. Conversely, casualness about or the breaking
      of covenants and commitments, failing to pray and study the scriptures, and inappropriate
      thoughts and actions and language and dress cause the Holy Ghost to withdraw or to avoid
      us altogether. Can you begin to understand why abiding by the Honor and Dress Codes is so
      important to your success at Ricks College? These Codes are not about curfew and clothing;
      rather, they are about commitments and obedience. Most importantly, the Honor and Dress
      Codes are about inviting the presence of the Holy Ghost into our lives, into our
      classrooms, and to this special campus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please do not believe the falsehood that somehow you and I can
      &quot;<i> . . . live the spirit of the law even if we are in violation of its letter</i>&quot;
      (Elder M. Russell Ballard, <u>BYU Speeches</u>, March&nbsp;12, 1996, pg. 189). The small
      things really do matter when it comes to personal worthiness and inviting the Holy Ghost
      into our lives. Elder Richard G. Scott has taught: <i>&quot;Even matters that are
      considered relatively small deviations will seriously affect [your] capacity to be led by
      the Spirit</i>&quot; (<i>Helping Others to Be Spiritually Led</i>, an address delivered at
      a symposium on August 11, 1998, at Brigham Young University, pg. 12). Thus, because small
      things do matter, you and I should strive to become like the stripling warriors described
      in the Book of Mormon who:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">. . .<i> did obey and observe to perform every word of command
        with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them</i> . .
        .&nbsp;. (Alma&nbsp;57:21)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>. . . and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from
        day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his
        commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that
        which is to come . . .</i> . (Alma 58:40)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now before I discuss the next principle, I must raise a voice of
      warning as both a Seventy and as the president of Ricks College. The opposite of inviting
      the Spirit is offending or repulsing the Spirit. In our modern world, the very
      technologies that bless our lives and enable us to instantly view and access news and
      information from around the world also have the potential to drive the Spirit away from us
      and even destroy us. Vile and filthy pornographic material can be accessed in the privacy
      of our homes, our offices, and our work areas with the simple click of a computer mouse or
      a TV remote control. Perhaps the most sinister aspect of such sin is the fact that it
      seemingly occurs in private. And if we come to believe that sinning &quot;<i>in secret</i>&quot;
      somehow is less serious because it does not hurt anyone else, then we may be less willing
      or even unable to stop. Remember, Satan and Cain devised their evil plan &quot;<i>in
      secret</i>&quot; (Moses 5:30). But we can keep no secrets from our Heavenly Father. The
      Holy Ghost knows about, is offended by, and flees from those who view pornographic
      material, whether in public or in private.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It just may be the case that an idle moment of casual curiosity
      while surfing through TV channels or on the Internet ensnares us in a trap of evil from
      which we might never escape. To all students and employees at Ricks College, please avoid
      pornographic materials of any kind. Pornography is an insidious poison. Viewing
      pornography is addictive and will destroy you spiritually. It can also cause you to lose
      the privilege of studying at or continuing as an employee of this great institution. Such
      salacious materials have the potential to destroy individuals and thereby to weaken the
      entire campus community. All of us who are blessed to study and work at Ricks College have
      a sacred responsibility to live in such a way that the Holy Ghost can reside with us and
      on this campus.</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">Principle #3 &#151; We must heed simple
      promptings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are prompted by the Holy Ghost every day to do
      ordinary and simple things. For example, we are prompted to say our personal prayers every
      morning and every night. We are prompted to study the scriptures. We are prompted to keep
      the commitments we made in connection with the Honor and Dress Codes. To the degree that
      we heed these simple promptings, then our capacity to recognize and respond to the Holy
      Ghost is increased. To the degree that we do not heed these simple promptings, then our
      capacity to recognize and respond to the Holy Ghost is decreased. We are either
      progressing or regressing in our ability to recognize and respond to the Holy Ghost. There
      is no neutral ground; there is no standing still.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The law of the harvest is real; we cannot gather crops in the
      fall which we did not properly plant and cultivate during the spring and summer. And we
      cannot realistically expect to recognize &quot;<i>big</i>&quot; promptings if we
      consistently fail to heed the &quot;<i>small</i>&quot; ones. The Lord&#146;s pattern is to
      teach us &quot;<i>. . . line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a
      little&nbsp;</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;&nbsp;(2 Nephi 28:30). Thus, revelation from our
      Heavenly Father comes most frequently in small increments and, like all knowledge, is
      granted according to our preparation. Misguided attempts to get spiritually supercharged
      through unusually long prayers, lengthy and unwise fasting, and intensive, short-term
      temple attendance certainly are no substitute for gradual, consistent, and conscientious
      attention to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080">Principle #4 &#151; We must heed promptings
      quickly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Have you ever received and recognized a prompting from the Holy
      Ghost, and then decided to respond to it &quot;<i>later</i>&quot;? And then when later
      arrived, you found that you could not remember the prompting. I have learned that acting
      upon promptings quickly greatly increases our capacity to receive and recognize the
      influence of the Holy Ghost. I have also learned that properly recording spiritual
      impressions demonstrates to the Savior how much I treasure His direction. The simple
      practice of writing down spiritual thoughts and feelings greatly enhances the likelihood
      of receiving and recognizing additional promptings from the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, those are the four basic principles I have
      learned about receiving, recognizing, and responding to the promptings of the Holy Ghost:
      (1) desire, (2) invite, (3)&nbsp;heed simple promptings, and (4) heed promptings quickly.
      If you and I have a sincere desire for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost,
      invite His influence into our lives through our obedience and actions, and learn to heed
      simple promptings and to do so quickly, then I testify and promise that we will be able to
      tell the difference between our own emotions telling us what we want to hear and the Holy
      Ghost telling us what we need to hear. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I once was traveling to a stake conference assignment on a small
      and noisy commuter airplane. Seated in the row just in front of me on the plane was a
      woman with three young children ranging in age from an infant to a four-year-old. Because
      the plane had only two seats on each side of the center aisle, the mother was situated
      quite some distance from her oldest child, a cute little boy who obviously was flying on
      an airplane for the very first time. His nose was pressed firmly against the window so he
      would have a good view of everything that was taking place, and he delighted in describing
      what he was seeing to his mother as the engines started and as we taxied down the runway
      for takeoff. The little boy&#146;s eyes were wide and his voice was full of excitement as
      the plane climbed into the sky.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">During all of this time, however, the mother was busy with the
      two youngest children, getting them buckled into their seats, finding toys, and responding
      to their needs and requests. The mother consistently had been responding to the little
      boy&#146;s enthusiastic exclamations in a calm, soothing voice. But because of the noise
      of the engines and the clatter of the small airplane, the little boy could not hear his
      mother&#146;s responses. After we had been in the air for about five minutes, and thinking
      that his mother was not paying adequate attention to him, the little boy blurted out,
      &quot;<i>Mom, you&#146;re not listening to me!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I then observed a very interesting thing. The wise mother
      continued to respond and talk to her son in the same calm tones, never raising her voice.
      Eventually the little boy was able to hear his mom&#146;s voice in spite of the engine and
      other noises on the plane. The mother&#146;s voice did not change; rather, the little
      boy&#146;s ability to hear her voice in the midst of the noise increased. It took some
      time, but the little boy learned how to block out the distracting noises around him and
      focus upon the familiar voice of his mother.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, as we desire and invite the Holy Ghost into
      our lives and learn to heed simple promptings quickly, we too can block out the
      distracting noises of the world and clearly focus upon the promptings of the Holy Ghost.
      In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Savior describes The Church of
      Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as &quot;<i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the only true and
      living Church upon the face of the whole earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>&quot; (D&amp;C 1:30).
      It is the Holy Ghost and its attendant spiritual gifts that make this Church living. And
      may each of us become a living member of this living Church by living in such a way that
      the Holy Ghost can be our constant companion.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, the doctrines and principles I have
      discussed today are true. I testify and witness that God the Eternal Father and His
      Beloved Son live. I know the Holy Ghost is real and will be our constant companion if we
      allow Him to be. I know the fullness of the gospel was restored to the earth in these
      latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. And I know that President Gordon B. Hinckley
      is the Lord&#146;s prophet on the earth today. Of which I testify and declare my witness
      in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>
