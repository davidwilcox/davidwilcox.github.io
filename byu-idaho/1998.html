<p>Since assuming my responsibilities as the president of Ricks College last
    summer, one of my points of emphasis has been the study and use of the scriptures. Those
    of you who are new to Ricks will note that at the beginning of today's devotional
    assembly, Brother Bird asked you to hold up your scriptures. This is a new tradition we
    started at our first devotional last fall, and it is a tradition through which we will
    continue to encourage all students and faculty to consistently study and use the
    scriptures. As I am sure most of you recognize, the real significance of this tradition is
    not merely bringing and holding up your scriptures every Tuesday in devotional. Rather,
    this simple act is but a reminder and symbol of our collective appreciation for, desire to
    learn from, and commitment to consistently and conscientiously study the holy scriptures.&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>Today I hope to accomplish two objectives as I visit with you:
    (1) provide a doctrinal foundation for understanding the importance of studying the
    scriptures and (2) emphasize basic principles that can help each of us become more
    effective in our personal study of the scriptures. I pray for, I yearn for, and I invite
    the Spirit of the Lord to be with each of us today, that we may understand each other and
    truly be edified.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am going to refer to a number of scriptures--many more than we
    could possibly look up and read together in the allotted devotional time. Some of the
    references I will specifically ask you to look up in your scriptures and read along with
    me; other verses I will quote directly and provide only the reference. You may find it
    helpful to jot down the references and study the quoted verses in more detail at a later
    time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Prophets, church leaders, advisors, teachers, and parents all
    talk and teach about the importance of studying the scriptures. Why is studying the
    scriptures so important? May I suggest three answers:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Studying the scriptures is important because of the
    covenants we have made.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Studying the scriptures is important because of the
    direction we need in our lives.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Studying the scriptures is important because scripture
    study is a preparation for and prerequisite to receiving personal revelation.&nbsp;
    	<br />&nbsp; <br />Those three answers can be summarized in the following words:
    covenants, direction, and revelation. Those are three doctrinal reasons why studying the
    scriptures is so important.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A covenant is an agreement between God and his children here upon
    the earth. God sets the conditions of the covenant, and there are promised blessings. As
    we are obedient to the conditions of the covenant, we receive the promised blessings.
    Verse 77 in Section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants outlines the three specific covenants
    we make at the time we enter the waters of baptism. We hear this prayer and are reminded
    of the covenants each Sunday as we partake of the emblems of the sacrament.&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son,
    Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of
    it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God,
    the Eternal Father, that they are willing to <b>take upon them the name of thy Son</b>,
    and <b>always remember him</b> and <b>keep his commandments which he has given them</b>;
    that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen. (D&amp;C 20:77, emphasis
    added)&nbsp; </p>
<p>The three conditions are that we (1) take upon us the name of
    Christ, (2) always remember him, and (3) keep the commandments. The promised blessing is
    that we will always have his Spirit to be with us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I want to draw your attention to the second covenantal obligation
    to &quot;always remember him.&quot; I do not know of a better way to always remember him
    than to daily study the scriptures. That covenant is not an abstract notion. It can be
    honored in meaningful, personal prayer every morning and night and in diligent study of
    the scriptures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I served as a stake president and interviewed literally
    hundreds of members of the Church, I frequently would ask, &quot;Do you remember and keep
    the covenants you have made?&quot; I do not recall many people answering no. When I would
    inquire further and ask about their scripture study, some would say, &quot;I do not have
    time.&quot; Then I would ask about their personal prayers, and the answer often was,
    &quot;I am not as consistent as I should be.&quot; On some occasions I would then inquire,
    &quot;Do you, in fact, keep the covenant to always remember Him?&quot;&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>The covenants we make in the waters of baptism are a commitment
    to always remember him, in part through meaningful prayer and diligent study of the
    scriptures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The second doctrinal reason for studying the scriptures is
    explained in 2 Nephi: &quot;. . . the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye
    should do&quot; (2 Nephi 32:3). Please turn with me to Alma, Chapter 37. We will focus for
    just a moment on the blessing of direction in our life that comes through the scriptures.&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in
    thy youth to keep the commandments of God.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for
    good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over
    you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks
    unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day. (Alma 37:35,
    37)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Verse 35 is an admonition for us to obtain wisdom in our youth.
    Verse 37 focuses on the importance of prayer morning and night. Now look at verse 38:&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing
    which our fathers call a ball, or director--or our fathers called it Liahona, which is,
    being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it. (Alma 37:38)&nbsp; 		<br />&nbsp; <br />So what was discussed immediately before this reference to the
    Liahona? Personal prayer. What did the Liahona provide? Direction in the wilderness for
    Lehi and his family.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now note what follows:&nbsp; </p>
<p>And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so
    curious a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course
    which they should travel in the wilderness.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />And it did work for them according to their faith in God; . . .
    (Alma 37:39-40)&nbsp; </p>
<p>In later verses it indicates that when they were slothful and
    disobedient, the Liahona no longer provided the direction that was needed. Look at verse
    42:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a
    direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.
    (Alma 37:42)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />We have just read about the importance of personal prayer, the
    Liahona that provided direction, and how the Liahona worked to provide direction. Let's
    begin reading in verse 43:&nbsp; </p>
<p>And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these
    things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this
    compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper even so it is with things
    which are spiritual.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which
    will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give
    heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>And now I say, is there not a type of this thing? For just as
    surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised
    land, shall <b>the words of Christ</b>, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this
    vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise. (Alma 37:43-45, emphasis added)&nbsp;
    	<br />&nbsp; <br />Thus, Alma teaches us in this chapter that personal prayer and
    scripture study provide direction in our lives just as the Liahona provided guidance to
    Lehi and his family in the wilderness.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By way of review, the first reason for studying the scriptures is
    the covenants we have made. The second reason is the word of Christ as contained in the
    scriptures will provide the direction we need in our lives.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Revelation is the third doctrinal reason for studying the
    scriptures. Scripture study is a preparation for and prerequisite to receiving personal
    revelation. Let us think for a moment of the experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith. What
    was it that preceded the First Vision? Joseph attended a number of religious revivals and
    was confronted with confusing and competing claims. In the midst of the confusion, and as
    he was striving to find which of all the churches he should join, he read in James:
    &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
    upbraideth not; . . .&quot; (James 1:5). Joseph was studying the scriptures. I would
    admonish you to read (at a later time) in the <u>Joseph Smith History</u> about the impact
    of that verse of scripture upon the young boy Joseph Smith. He reflected upon it over and
    over again. He stated that never before had a verse of scripture entered into his heart
    and soul with such impact as that verse did at that time. Scripture study preceded the
    First Vision.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Think of the experience the Prophet Joseph Smith had as he was
    translating the Book of Mormon. I would like you to turn to Section 13 of the Doctrine and
    Covenants; I will use this section as an illustration of how the work of translating the
    golden plates preceded many revelations. In the chapter heading at the beginning of
    Section 13 it says: &quot;Ordination of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic
    Priesthood along the bank of the Susquehanna River, near Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 15,
    1829.&quot; Now let me read something from the <u>Joseph Smith History</u> concerning this
    revelation:&nbsp; </p>
<p>We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing
    month (May, 1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord
    respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation
    of the plates.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />It was during the work of translating the golden plates, while
    seeking to understand the need for the ordinance of baptism and having a question about
    proper authority, that Joseph and Oliver decided to inquire of the Lord.&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a
    messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he
    ordained us, saying, . . .&quot; (Joseph Smith History, 1:68)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 		<br />What followed is recorded today as Section 13 of the Doctrine and
    Covenants. What was it that preceded the visitation of John the Baptist and the conferral
    of the Aaronic Priesthood? Scripture study.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Later in his ministry, the Prophet Joseph Smith received the
    assignment to review and translate the Bible. During his work on that translation, he
    inquired of the Lord on numerous occasions. These are just a few examples of the
    revelations that were received: Section 76 (the vision pertaining to the degrees of glory;
    Section 77 (insights into the revelation of John); Section 91 (information about the
    Apocrypha); Section 132 (eternal marriage). All of these revelations came as a result of
    his work in translating the Bible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here are two assignments for you. First, in your personal study,
    see if you can learn how many and specifically which revelations presently contained in
    the Doctrine and Covenants came as a result of Joseph's work of translating the Book of
    Mormon. Second, see if you can determine specifically which revelations in the Doctrine
    and Covenants came as a result of his work in translating the Bible. As you undertake
    these assignments, you will quickly learn that the vast majority of the revelations
    presently contained in the Doctrine and Covenants came in connection with the work of
    translating these two volumes of scripture. What preceded revelation? Scripture study.&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>Please turn to Section 138 in the Doctrine and Covenants. This is
    the revelation in which Joseph F. Smith learned about the organization of the work of
    proclaiming the gospel in the spirit world. I draw your attention to verse 1: &quot;On the
    third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering
    over the scriptures&quot; (D&amp;C 138:1). This verse contains tremendous insight about
    the relationship between scripture study and receiving revelation. We will not take the
    time now to detail those insights. But I encourage you, at a later time, to look at,
    study, and understand what is contained in Section 138 as it relates to scripture study
    and receiving revelation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Again, let me summarize the three reasons why scripture study is
    so important: (1) It is one of the major ways whereby we keep our covenant to always
    remember him. (2) It helps us become familiar with the voice of the Lord and thus better
    prepared to receive his direction in our lives. (3) It is a necessary preparation for and
    prerequisite to receiving personal revelation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie has explained:&nbsp; </p>
<p>May I suggest, based upon personal experience, that faith comes
    and revelations are received as a direct result of scripture study. Paul says 		<i>&quot;faith
    cometh by hearing.&quot;</i> Joseph Smith taught that to gain faith men must have a
    knowledge of the nature and kind of being God is; they must have a correct idea of his
    character, perfections, and attributes; and they must so live as to gain the assurance
    that their conduct is in harmony with the divine will. Faith is thus born of scripture
    study. Those who study, ponder, and pray about the scriptures, seeking to understand their
    deep and hidden meanings, receive great outpourings of light and knowledge from the Holy
    Spirit. (Bruce R. McConkie, from &quot;Holy Writ Published Anew,&quot; an address
    delivered at the Regional Representatives Seminar, April 2, 1982)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 		<br />Now I would like to suggest just a few principles that can help each
    of us become more effective in our personal study of the scriptures.&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>First, <b>pray for understanding and invite the help of the Holy
    Ghost</b>. The things of the spirit can only be learned by and through the influence of
    the Spirit. Each time we begin a session of sincere scripture study, an earnest and humble
    prayer in which we petition our Heavenly Father in the name of his Son for the assistance
    of the Holy Ghost will greatly improve our learning and our understanding.&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>The second principle is <b>work</b>. Gospel knowledge and
    understanding come through diligent study of the scriptures and the tutoring of the Holy
    Ghost. The combination that opens the vault door to hidden scriptural treasures includes a
    great deal of work--simple, old-fashioned, hard work. A farmer cannot expect to harvest in
    the fall if he does not properly sow in the spring and work hard during the summer to
    weed, nourish, and cultivate the field. So it is for you and me. We cannot expect to reap
    scriptural insight unless we pay the price of regular and diligent study. Casual strolling
    through or dabbling in the scriptures will not yield enduring gospel understanding. As
    Elder Maxwell has noted on several occasions, we are to &quot;feast upon the words of
    Christ--not nibble&quot; (<u>Plain and Precious Things</u>, p. 3). And the scriptural
    treasures we seek in our lives cannot be borrowed or loaned or obtained second-hand. We
    must each learn to open the vault door by applying the principle of work.&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>The third principle is <b>consistency</b>. Given the hectic pace
    of our lives, good intentions and simply &quot;hoping&quot; to find the time for
    meaningful scripture study are not sufficient. My experience suggests that a specific and
    scheduled time set aside each day and, as much as possible, a particular place for study
    greatly increase the effectiveness of our searching through the scriptures.&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>The fourth principle is to <b>ponder</b>. Please turn with me to
    Chapter 4 in 2 Nephi. Nephi is describing the things of his soul:&nbsp; </p>
<p>And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the
    scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul delighteth in the
    scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit
    of my children.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart
    pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard. (2 Nephi 4:15-16)&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>The word <i>ponder</i> means to consider, to contemplate, to
    reflect upon, or to think about. The process of pondering takes time and cannot be forced,
    hurried, or rushed. As described by Nephi in the verses we just read, pondering is very
    much related to our covenant responsibility to &quot;always remember him.&quot;&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>Recall the experience of President Joseph F. Smith in Section 138
    as he sat in his room &quot;pondering over the scriptures.&quot; This principle of
    pondering does not just apply to and work for apostles and prophets. It applies to you and
    to me in our everyday lives.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith provided an important guideline about
    how we can ponder the scriptures. He said, &quot;I have a key by which I understand the
    scriptures. I enquire, what was the question which drew out the answer, or caused Jesus to
    utter the parable?&quot; (<u>History of the Church</u>, Vol 5, Ch. 13, p. 261). What was
    the question that brought about Section 13 of the Doctrine and Covenants? A question about
    the ordinance of baptism and the need for proper authority.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Think about Section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Word of
    Wisdom. Listen carefully to this description by Brigham Young:&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think I am as well acquainted with the circumstances which led
    to the giving of the Word of Wisdom as any man in the Church, although I was not present
    at the time to witness them. The first school of the prophets was held in a small room
    situated over the Prophet Joseph's kitchen, in a house which belonged to Bishop Whitney. .
    . . The brethren came to that place for hundreds of miles to attend school in a little
    room probably no larger than eleven by fourteen. When they assembled together in this room
    after breakfast, the first they did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk
    about the great things of the kingdom and spit all over the room, and as soon as the pipe
    was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often when the
    Prophet entered the room to give the school instructions he would find himself in a cloud
    of tobacco smoke. This, and the complaints of his wife at having to clean so filthy a
    floor, made the Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the
    conduct of the Elders in using tobacco, and the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom was
    the result of his inquiry. (<u>Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses</u>, Vol. 12, pp.
    157-158, February 8, 1868)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />What was the question that brought about the inquiry and the
    revelation?&nbsp; </p>
<p>President Benson has provided another guideline that we can use
    as we ponder the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon. He said:&nbsp; 		</p>
<p>If [the Book of Mormon writers] saw our day and chose those
    things which would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how we should study the Book of
    Mormon? We should constantly ask ourselves, &quot;Why did the Lord inspire Mormon (or
    Moroni or Alma) to include that in his record? What lesson can I learn from that to help
    me live in this day and age?&quot; (Ezra T. Benson, &quot;The Book of Mormon--Keystone of
    Our Religion,&quot; <u>Ensign</u>, November 1986, p. 6)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />In other words, President Benson told us, as did Nephi, to
    &quot;liken all scriptures unto us&quot; (1 Nephi 19:23). So we have guidelines from both
    President Benson and Joseph Smith regarding the process of pondering the scriptures.&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>The fifth principle is to <b>look for connections and patterns
    and parallels</b> in the scriptures. Rather than simply tell you about this principle, I
    would like to use an example. Please turn to Mosiah, Chapter 3. We are going to read verse
    19. I suspect most of us can recite this verse from memory. As I read, I want to draw your
    attention to the very last part of the verse.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the
    fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy
    Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of
    Christ . . .&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Now this is the part I want to emphasize. The verse thus far has
    described the process of putting off the natural man and becoming a saint through the
    atonement of Christ. As that process takes hold in our life, this is what occurs:&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>. . . and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient,
    full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon
    him, even as a child doth submit to his father. (Mosiah 3:19)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 		<br />Keep your finger in Chapter 3 and turn to Chapter 24 in Mosiah. I
    want to draw your attention to verses 14 and 15. In this chapter Amulon and his followers
    are persecuting Alma and his people. Great burdens are placed upon their backs. Verses 14
    and 15 describe how the people are enabled to bear the burdens.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your
    shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage;
    and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know
    of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.&nbsp; 		<br />&nbsp; <br />And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma
    and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear
    up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the
    will of the Lord. (Mosiah 24:14-15)&nbsp; </p>
<p>The latter portion of verse 19 in Chapter 3 describes the
    characteristics of those who are putting off the natural man and becoming more saintlike
    through the atonement of Christ. In Chapter 24 we learn how Alma's people were
    strengthened. The burden did not change. Rather, their strength and capacity were
    increased to bear the burdens &quot;with ease.&quot; How did that strengthening occur? If
    we compare Mosiah 3:19 and Mosiah 24:15, it is clear that the additional strength came
    through the enabling power of the atonement of Christ. As we put off the natural man and
    become more saintlike through the atonement, we become increasingly childlike and
    submissive. Look at the very end of verse 15 in Chapter 24: &quot;. . . and they did
    submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.&quot; These
    characteristics in Chapter 24 parallel and are related to the characteristics described in
    Chapter 3. There is a connection and a relationship between what happened to Alma and his
    people and King Benjamin's preaching about the atonement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are layers of meaning in the scriptures, brothers and
    sisters. As we have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, those meanings can be revealed to
    us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The sixth principle is to <b>write your thoughts and feelings</b>.
    Recording what we learn and writing about what we think and feel as we study the
    scriptures helps us to revisit the same spirit that brought the initial insight or
    revelation and invites even greater understanding than was originally received. Recording
    our learnings and writing about our thoughts and feelings is another form of pondering and
    of always remembering him and is an invitation to the Holy Ghost for continued
    instruction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I personally bear testimony of the power of this principle. As we
    take the time to write what we think and feel in relation to studying the scriptures, an
    additional and increased outpouring of insight will come.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let me summarize the six principles:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Pray for understanding and invite the help of the Holy
    Ghost.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Be consistent in terms of time and place.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Ponder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Look for connections and patterns and parallels in the
    scriptures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#149; Record your thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I want to conclude with a testimony that may initially seem
    unrelated to my remarks about scripture study. The scriptures are prerecorded revelation.
    Just as you can listen to recorded music over and over again and be greatly benefitted, so
    we can repeatedly review the written word. But would you rather listen to a prerecorded
    tape or attend a live performance? I would suggest, for example, that a CD of the Mormon
    Tabernacle Choir, as good as that CD may be, does not compare to a live performance in the
    Tabernacle where you can feel the spiritual power of those magnificent voices.&nbsp;
    	</p>
<p>What follows is a description by Wilford Woodruff of an episode
    that took place with Brigham Young and the Prophet Joseph Smith:&nbsp; </p>
<p>I will refer to a certain meeting I attended in the town of
    Kirtland in my early days. At that meeting some remarks were made that have been made here
    today, with regard to the living oracles and with regard to the written word of God. The
    same principle was presented, although not as extensively as it has been here, when a
    leading man in the Church got up and talked upon the subject, and said: &quot;You have got
    the word of God before you here in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants;
    you have the written word of God, and you who give revelations should give revelations
    according to those books, as what is written in those books is the word of God. We should
    confine ourselves to them.&quot; When he concluded, Brother Joseph turned to Brother
    Brigham Young and said, &quot;Brother Brigham I want you to take the stand and tell us
    your views with regard to the written oracles and the written word of God.&quot; Brother
    Brigham took the stand, and he took the Bible, and laid it down; he took the Book of
    Mormon, and laid it down; and he took the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and laid it down
    before him, and he said: &quot;There is the written word of God to us, concerning the work
    of God from the beginning of the world, almost, to our day.&quot; &quot;And now,&quot;
    said he, &quot;when compared with the living oracles those books are nothing to me; those
    books do not convey the word of God direct to us now, as do the words of a Prophet or a
    man bearing the Holy Priesthood in our day and generation. I would rather have the living
    oracles than all the writing in the books.&quot; That was the course he pursued. When he
    was through, Brother Joseph said to the congregation: &quot;Brother Brigham has told you
    the word of the Lord, and he has told you the truth.&quot; (Wilford Woodruff, Conference
    Report, October 1897, pp. 22-23)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Brothers and sisters, I bear testimony of the power of the word of
    God as taught by living apostles and prophets and as contained in the holy scriptures. I
    pray that we will understand the doctrinal foundation and principles I have outlined
    today. May we go from this assembly and apply them. I testify that these doctrines and
    principles are true. I know of their power and promise that you will feel that power in
    your life. I know God lives. I testify that Jesus is the Christ. I am grateful for the
    tutoring influence of the spirit of the Holy Ghost. And I testify that God, the Eternal
    Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. I further
    testify that there are living apostles and prophets on the earth today who direct the
    affairs of this church, even The Church of Jesus Christ. Of this I testify and of this I
    declare my witness, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

    Response</b></font><br />
<b>President David A. Bednar</b><br />
<b>Friday, February 27, 1998</b><br />
<b><font size="-1">© 1998 by Ricks College.&nbsp; All rights reserved.</font></b> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">President and Sister Hinckley, honored guests, students and
    colleagues of Ricks College, my brothers and sisters.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I am honored and humbled by the charge and responsibility I
    have received today from the President of the Church. The invitation from the Brethren to
    become the fourteenth president of Ricks College was unexpected and has been a great
    blessing in my life and for our family. One does not aspire to or apply for a position
    such as this. My only qualifications for this sacred stewardship are a willingness to work
    and a desire to learn. President Hinckley, I accept your charge and pledge to work with
    all of my heart, might, mind, and strength to achieve the goals you have outlined. I
    appreciate and will strive to be worthy of the trust the Brethren and the Board of
    Trustees have expressed in me and our family through this invitation to serve. This is the
    most exciting and overwhelming invitation I have ever received.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Not only was the invitation to serve as the president of Ricks
    College unexpected for our family, it was surprising to some people who have known me. I
    recently received an interesting e-mail message from the daughter of one of my Primary
    teachers. Back in the days when I attended Primary, it was held once a week in the
    afternoon following school. I remember riding every week with a number of my friends to
    Primary with Sister Gladys Cheney, our teacher. Apparently I have forgotten much of what
    transpired during those weekly trips to Primary. The e-mail message I received from Sister
    Cheney's daughter included the following statement:</font> </p>
<p><i>My mom really wanted to write you a letter because
    she has been following your life's progress through the years in the Church News. She is
    so proud of you and wanted to let you know that, but did not quite know where to begin. I
    told her I would write you a quick letter, and that was fine with her. She chuckles every
    time she thinks of those rides to Primary and how well you've turned out.</i> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Clearly, the invitation to serve at Ricks surprised the one
    Primary teacher who undoubtedly knew me the best!</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Brothers and sisters, I have been taught since my youth to
    &quot;follow the prophet.&quot; Never in my wildest imagination, however, did I ever think
    I would speak in the same meeting with and literally &quot;follow the prophet&quot; as I
    have been assigned to do today. I pray for and invite the spirit of the Holy Ghost to be
    with us during our time together, that I may appropriately express the feelings of my
    heart and that we may understand each other and be edified on this special occasion.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">In the few minutes I have to speak with you today, I would
    like to achieve two major objectives: (1) to express appreciation to some very special
    people and (2) to speak about the future of Ricks College.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I would like to begin by expressing appreciation to my wife
    Susan. Next month Sister Bednar and I will have been married for 23 years. We have now
    reached the point in our lives where we have been married longer than we were single.
    Other than my time in the mission field in Southern Germany, I really do not remember very
    much about what it was like to live without her.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Susan is a virtuous woman and a righteous mother. Purity and
    goodness are reflected in her countenance. Indeed, she is receiving His image in her
    countenance (Alma 5: 14). I love her and appreciate the complementary influence she is in
    my life. I thank her for the woman she is and the lessons she has taught me. All that is
    good in my life has come because of and with her.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">In our marriage we have been blessed with three sons: Eric
    will soon be 22, Mike is about to turn 20, and in a few weeks Jeff will be 16. No mom and
    dad could be more pleased than we are with these precious sons. Susan and I have become
    one through these young men, and we have learned much in the process of attempting to
    teach and rear them. They are wonderful boys certainly not perfect boys, but they are very
    good boys.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Let me share with you just one quick story about our sons. We
    lived for many years in Fayetteville, Arkansas, while I was employed as a business
    professor at the University of Arkansas. We were and still are avid Arkansas Razorback
    basketball fans. We had season tickets and enjoyed attending almost every home game. A few
    years ago the featured game of the season, No. 1 UNLV verses No. 2 Arkansas, was scheduled
    to be played on a Sunday afternoon. We had a long-standing tradition in our family of not
    participating in little league, soccer, basketball, or other sports events on Sunday, nor
    did we attend or watch sports on Sunday. In our family council meeting the week before the
    game, Susan and I asked Eric, Mike, and Jeff what they thought we should do with our
    tickets. The unanimous decision we reached was to sell the priceless tickets to one of our
    neighbors. I will never forget Mike saying to me immediately after the closing prayer in
    our family council, &quot;Dad, hurry up and sell those tickets before I change my
    mind!&quot; They really are very good boys.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Eric and Jeff are present with us today. Mike is serving as a
    missionary in Bolivia. We are confident that he is aware of and participating in the
    special spirit of this occasion.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I express appreciation to my mom and dad, both of whom are
    deceased. I am thankful for their sacrifices in my behalf, and I hope they are aware of
    the events of this day.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I also am thankful for Sue's parents, Kay and Nyla Robinson. I
    love them as I love my own parents and appreciate their love and support.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Finally, I am thankful for many other relatives, friends, and
    colleagues, too numerous to mention, who have influenced me in positive ways. I appreciate
    the contribution each of you has made to my life.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Now I would like to spend a few minutes visiting with you
    about the future of Ricks College. As we prepare for and move into the next century, we at
    Ricks College are embarking upon a voyage that will be filled with high adventure.
    Sweeping changes are occurring around and along our &quot;charted course&quot; (J. Reuben
    Clark, Jr., &quot;The Charted Course of the Church in Education,&quot; The Improvement
    Era, September 1938, Volume 41, Number 9, pp. &amp; nbsp 520-575), both in our sponsoring
    institution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in the world of
    education. The rapid growth of the Church throughout the world will require us to be ever
    better stewards of the sacred resources and support we receive. And the changes presently
    taking place in institutions of higher education around the world are nothing short of
    revolutionary. New technologies, innovative pedagogies, and more sophisticated students
    are challenging us to rethink and reevaluate many of our most fundamental assumptions
    about the processes of learning and teaching.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">These and many other changes will cause us to move out of our
    established &quot;comfort zones&quot; and confront a series of apparent contradictions and
    paradoxes. For example, it will be necessary for us at Ricks College to <b>remain the same
    even as we change</b>. The &quot;Spirit of Ricks,&quot; the unique combination of
    spirituality and supportiveness that characterizes the interaction among students,
    faculty, and staff on this campus, must be preserved and enhanced even in the midst of
    dramatic changes in how we accomplish the work of education. It will be necessary for us
    at Ricks College to <b>serve ever better the thousands of students we have on campus while
    simultaneously reaching out to bless the lives of tens of thousands of young Latter-day
    Saints throughout the world</b>. We have an ever increasing responsibility to use the
    resources of this great campus to assist in the building of the kingdom of God in all of
    the world.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">It will be necessary for us at Ricks College to <b>move
    forward rapidly even as we pause to thoroughly assess and evaluate our existing programs
    and our present use of physical space</b>. The swift currents of change along our route
    will not cease temporarily for us to make unobstructed and safe mid-course corrections.
    Rather, as we navigate, we must remain fixed upon the instruction we receive from the
    Board and our own specific mission statement to guide us through turbulent waters.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Along our charted course we will undoubtedly encounter many
    potential perils and unseen obstacles. It is a wonderful feeling of security and safety to
    know that we are under the leadership of a pilot who knows the course the ship is sailing.
    William R. Sloan, president of the Northwestern States Mission, shared the following
    observations and experience in general conference many years ago:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I have rejoiced in my acquaintance with the
    leadership of this Church. I am thrilled beyond all words of expression for this
    acquaintance with them and bear witness that they are men of integrity and men of God.</font>
</p>
<p>Last summer it was our pleasure to visit Alaska. We
    took the inland route, and you who have enjoyed that wonderful voyage know that the
    channels you go through, in many cases, are very narrow. One evening the pilot invited
    Sister Sloan and myself into the pilot room. As we sailed along the narrow channel he
    pointed out to us and said, &quot;I want you people to note that just on the opposite
    side, on the right side of the boat [and the boat was moving very slowly] a few feet
    underneath the water, about eight or ten feet from the vessel, there is a great ledge of
    rock. Many a ship has struck the same and been sunk.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">So it is an inspiration to know in this Church that
    God is at the helm, and that his servants are inspired, directed and led by his influence.
    (William R. Sloan, Conference Report, April 1932, p. 17)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I testify that as we follow the direction of our inspired
    Board of Trustees, we will steer clear of the dangers, both seen and unseen, that could
    impede our progress towards our desired spiritual and educational destinations.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">The mission of Ricks College is clear and unchanging. Our
    efforts and resources are aimed at educating the whole man and woman, to focus upon the
    spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and physical development of every student who studies
    on this campus. Specifically, the mission of Ricks College is to (1) build testimonies of
    the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and encourage living its principles, (2) provide a
    quality education for students of diverse interests and abilities, (3) prepare students
    for further education and employment, and for their roles as citizens and parents, and (4)
    maintain a wholesome academic, cultural, social and spiritual environment.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Elder John A. Widstoe described the importance of this kind of
    comprehensive approach to education:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman"><i>. . . let me say again, that to be merely mentally
    trained is to be only partly trained. The man whose mind only has been trained may be
    likened to the ship with great engines and a huge propeller, ready to drive the ship
    forward, but without rudder, chart, compass, or definite destination. When we add to the
    man, so trained, spiritual training, then it is as if we add to the ship, with its
    wonderful machinery, a compass, a chart, a rudder, and a dependable intelligence which
    controls the whole machinery, above and below deck, so that the vessel may reach a safe
    haven, according to a definite purpose. </i><font size="2"> (John A. Widstoe, Conference Report, October 1922,
    p. 48)</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Let me provide one additional example of how important it is
    to maintain a clear focus upon the holistic education of young men and women. As I quote
    the following statement, I invite you to surmise the institution being referred to:</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman"><i>Let every student be plainly instructed, and
    earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies is, to know God
    and Jesus Christ which is eternal life </i> (John 17:3)<i>, and therefore to lay Christ in the
    bottom, as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning. . . . Everyone shall
    so exercise himself in reading the Scriptures twice a day, that he shall be ready to give
    such an account of his proficiency therein, both in theoretical observations of the
    language, and logic, and in practical and spiritual truths, as his tutor shall require,
    according to his ability; seeing the entrance of the word giveth light, it giveth
    understanding to the simple. </i><font size="2"> (The Founding of Harvard College, America, Vol. 2, pg.
    155-156)</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">This statement is found in a book entitled The Founding Of
    Harvard College and describes many of the basic principles upon which that great
    institution was founded. Clearly for us at Ricks College, maintaining a clear focus upon
    our central mission will be essential as we sail into the uncertain waters of a new
    century.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">For the past several months I have been intrigued by and
    diligently studying the account in the Book of Mormon of Lehi's family and their travels
    in the wilderness. As they reached the place called Bountiful, which was located near the
    sea, Nephi was commanded by the Lord to &quot;. . . construct a ship, after the manner
    which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across the waters&quot; (1 Nephi
    17:8). Brothers and sisters, the more I reflect upon this verse, the more interesting it
    becomes to me. Nephi was not a sailor. He had been reared in Jerusalem, an inland city,
    rather than along the borders of the Mediterranean Sea. It seems unlikely that he knew
    much about or had experience with the tools and skills necessary to build a ship. He may
    not have ever previously seen an ocean-going vessel. In essence, then, <b>Nephi was
    commanded and instructed to build something he had never built before in order to go
    someplace he had never been before</b>. May I suggest that Nephi's experience in building
    that ship is a model for us at Ricks College as we prepare for and move into the next
    century. We, too, must build something we have never built before in order to go someplace
    we have never been before.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Nephi further describes the process of constructing the ship:</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">. . . and we did work timbers of <b>curious
    workmanship</b>. And the Lord did show me from <b>time to time</b> after what manner I
    should work the timbers of the ship. (1 Nephi 18: 1-2; emphasis added)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Two points stand out in my mind about these verses. First, the
    manner of workmanship was curious. It is interesting that the phrase &quot;curious
    workmanship&quot; is used five times in the Book of Mormon: once in the testimony of the
    eight witnesses, twice in relation to the Liahona, once in relation to the productivity of
    a righteous and prosperous people, and in the verse I have just quoted in relation to the
    manner whereby Nephi would build the ship. The word curious in these contexts does not
    mean strange or weird or odd. Rather, it connotes careful, skilled, expert, and
    deliberate. Clearly the concept of &quot;curious workmanship&quot; sets a standard for us
    at Ricks College as we move forward to meet the challenges before us.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Second, the phrase &quot;time to time&quot; suggests to me
    that Nephi perhaps did not receive everything he needed to know about shipbuilding as he
    began his task. Apparently he received the necessary knowledge line upon line, precept
    upon precept, here a little and there a little as it was needed. This may be one of the
    first recorded instances of a Just-In-Time learning process.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Now please note with me the description Nephi provides in
    verse 4 of Chapter 18.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">And it came to pass that after I had finished the
    ship, according to the word of the Lord, <b>my brethren beheld that it was good</b>, and
    that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine; wherefore, they did humble themselves
    again before the Lord.&quot; (1 Nephi 18:4; emphasis added)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Even Nephi's brothers, who initially opposed the idea of
    constructing the ship and who were reluctant to help, ultimately had to acknowledge the
    &quot;goodness&quot; of the finished product.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I know, brothers and sisters, that we will be guided and
    directed by Him whose school this is as we respond to the challenge to build an
    educational ship of curious workmanship. As we at Ricks College construct our ship and
    travel according to the coordinates set by the Board and identified in our mission
    statement, Ricks College will become increasingly different from and distinctive among
    other institutions of higher education. Surely, we must build this ship after the manner
    which the Lord will show unto us and not after the manner of men. Our standards and
    practices indeed will be unique, and we will be &quot;set apart&quot; from the world.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I anticipate that we will be the focus of both flattery from
    the prominent and scorn from the many mocking voices originating in the &quot;great and
    spacious building,&quot; which Nephi described as the pride of the world. Those taunting
    voices will counsel us to &quot;chill out,&quot; &quot;loosen up,&quot; &quot;stop being
    so old-fashioned,&quot; and to &quot;get in step with the '90s.&quot; Some may mistakenly
    believe that we can chart our future course by comparing ourselves to the patterns and
    practices of the world. Certainly, we might rationalize, we are doing well because our
    standards are so much different from those generally found in the world.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Brother and sisters, please do not misunderstand the point I
    am attempting to make. There is much in our world that is lovely, praiseworthy, and of
    good report. And there are many professionals, craftspeople, and artists who greatly bless
    and enrich our lives through their diligence and intelligence. The Church and its related
    institutions do not have a monopoly on goodness. However, through the Restoration in these
    latter days we do have the fullness of the Savior's gospel, and the standard of progress
    we must apply is not to be found in comparisons to the perverse and misguided patterns and
    practices of the world. If it were, then comparing ourselves to the world would permit us
    to feel safe and secure while slipping ever deeper and deeper into what Nephi described as
    the river of filthiness. Rather, the standards come from and are established by the Lord.
    They do not change or vary, and they will be increasingly distinctive and, some will say,
    outdated in an ever more secularized and hedonistic world. May I suggest that those
    scornful voices will be one of the surest indicators that we are following precisely the
    proper coordinates on our voyage. The very fact that the world may say we should
    &quot;loosen up&quot; will be a confirmation that we are following the correct course.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Thus far I have highlighted the challenges and changes before
    us, and the fixed points of prophetic vision and a clear understanding of our mission that
    will provide direction for us during this voyage. I would now like to focus upon several
    fundamental principles that should be at the heart of all we are and do at Ricks College.
    Our planning and decisions and programs and activities should be focused upon and give
    emphasis to these basic principles.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">1. <b><i>True teaching is done by and with the Spirit of the
    Holy Ghost.</i></b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">All truth, spiritual as well as secular, is manifested through
    the spirit of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is a revelator, a teacher, a comforter, and a
    sanctifier. To create an environment where the Holy Ghost can teach, everything done at
    Ricks College must be in harmony with the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus
    Christ. As Elder Parley P. Pratt explained concerning the man or woman who is taught by
    the Holy Ghost: &quot;His mind is quickened, his intellectual faculties are aroused to
    intense activity. He is, as it were, illuminated. He learns more of divine truth in a few
    days than he could have learned in a lifetime in the best merely human institutions in the
    world.&quot; (Key to the Science of Theology, pg. 59-60). And as President Brigham Young
    taught: &quot;It [the Holy Ghost] shows them things past, present, and to come. It opens
    the vision of the mind, unlocks the treasures of wisdom, and they begin to understand the
    things of God. . . . They comprehend themselves and the great object of their
    existence&quot; (Journal of Discourses, 1:241).</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">2. <b><i>Every person at Ricks College is a teacher.</i></b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Everyone at Ricks College faculty, staff, students,
    ecclesiastical leaders, and so forth has a responsibility to impact others for good. Each
    interaction with a student or colleague is a potential teaching and learning opportunity.
    Let me provide two examples of what I mean by this principle.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">My first example of this principle is the faculty of Ricks
    College. We presently have 353 full-time teaching faculty on this campus. These dedicated
    teachers have provided a total of 5,209 years of service to the youth of the Church at
    Ricks College. Consider the impact for good of those years of faithful service in the
    lives of thousands, tens of thousands, and even millions of individuals and families
    throughout the world. The talents of these teachers easily would have enabled them to hold
    positions of prominence, prestige, and financial reward far beyond anything they have
    experienced at Ricks College. Yet they have chosen to forego those opportunities to live
    and work in Rexburg, Idaho, and serve the young people of the Church. These competent and
    dedicated faculty members could be elsewhere but love to teach and work and serve at Ricks
    College.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">My second example highlights how non-faculty employees at Ricks
    College also serve as teachers. I recently was assigned to preside at the Brigham City
    Utah West Stake conference. The stake president, Michael Dustin, is a graduate of Ricks
    College. President Dustin came to Ricks College in 1968 with no place to live and not
    knowing what to expect of college or of himself.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">President Dustin found a job on campus and was assigned to
    shovel snow and clean around the girls dorms. He was hired and supervised by Brother
    DaVawn Beattie. Today Brother Beattie is the supervisor of Grounds and the Motor Pool at
    Ricks College. It was obvious as I talked with President Dustin that he had a great regard
    and love for Brother Beattie. In fact, President Dustin named his youngest son Beattie
    Dustin as a tribute to DaVawn.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I asked President Dustin what DaVawn had done to have such a
    profound impact on his life and why he would name his son after him. He gave the following
    answers:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman"><i>DaVawn gave me direction in my life and helped me
    learn how to implement into my everyday life the things I was learning in my classes. He
    helped strengthen my testimony. He built us up and told us we were doing a good job. He
    was a friend and someone I could talk to.&nbsp;</i></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman"><i>When I was unsure about continuing in school, he
    taught me this principle: <b>If you get an education, you can more effectively serve the
    Lord. </b>That principle changed my life, and I have since taught it to many other adults
    and young people.</i></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">DaVawn is but one example of the hundreds of wonderful
    employees at Ricks College who also serve and bless students. Brother Beattie, you may not
    have attended college or received a degree; but in the curriculum of the eternities, you
    indeed have earned a Ph.D. You have not been assigned to be a classroom teacher at Ricks;
    however, in the things that matter most, you are an example of the first-class teaching
    that takes place at this college. Every person at Ricks College is a teacher.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">3. <b><i>The most effective teaching and learning experiences
    occur &quot;one by one.&quot;</i></b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Perhaps the defining characteristic of the Savior's ministry
    was His ability to teach &quot;one by one.&quot; For example, following His resurrection,
    he visited the Nephites on the American continent. He invited the 2,500 gathered near the
    temple in the Land of Bountiful to come forward &quot;one by one&quot; to feel the prints
    in His hands and feet and to thrust their hands into His side (3 Nephi 11). In one of the
    most moving stories in all of holy writ, He blessed the children &quot;one by one&quot; (3
    Nephi 17). He touched and tutored His Nephite disciples &quot;one by one&quot; (3 Nephi
    18; 3 Nephi 28).&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">This same principle manifests itself today in the worldwide
    labors of proclaiming the gospel, which is carried out &quot;one by one,&quot; and of
    redeeming the dead, as saving ordinances are provided &quot;one by one.&quot;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Ricks College is uniquely positioned as an institution of
    higher education to show and lead the way in applying the principle of &quot;one by
    one.&quot; This college is legendary for the individualized and nurturing attention given
    to students by the faculty and staff. Some people on campus candidly have shared with me
    their concerns that the growth in our student body and technological changes may inhibit
    our ability to provide &quot;one by one&quot; support in the future. Let me now emphasis
    an important point just as forcefully as I can. New technologies and innovative pedagogies
    at Ricks College cannot and will not replace the special powers of people in the processes
    of learning and teaching. Technology is not an educational panacea. In fact, some supposed
    technological advances seem to create as many if not more problems than they solve.
    However, technology can and should play a supporting and complementing role in our work of
    educating. If we are wise, we will learn to use technology and the other advancements at
    our disposal to greatly enhance both the opportunities for and effectiveness of our
    &quot;one by one&quot; teaching. I believe this principle in particular will distinguish
    us from other institutions of higher education and will in large measure define our
    educational ship of curious workmanship. We at Ricks College will be both high-tech and
    high-touch.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">4. <b><i>More students must be blessed.</i></b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">All worthy youth of the Church deserve a Ricks College
    experience, yet an increasingly smaller percentage of them will ever have that
    opportunity. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, it will be necessary for us at Ricks
    College to serve ever better the thousands of students we have on campus while
    simultaneously reaching out to bless the lives of tens of thousands of young Latter-day
    Saints throughout the world. We must learn how to assist and bless institute students and
    other LDS youth in Rhode Island and Rome while effectively serving our students on campus
    in Rexburg.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">5. <b><i>Righteous sociality (D&amp;C 130:2) is essential to
    individual development.</i></b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">The word &quot;<i>sociality</i>&quot; as used in the
    scriptures refers to more than the sociability and socialness we experience in everyday
    living. Sociality implies an enduring bond of love and brotherhood and sisterhood. In
    fact, sociality as described in the scriptures specifically refers to the organization of
    eternal families. The sweet and tender associations we enjoy &quot;here and now&quot; are
    but a foreshadowing of the eternal relationships that will endure &quot;there and
    then&quot; beyond the grave.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p>
<font face="Times Roman">The unique environment of Ricks College exists, in part, because
    of the righteous endeavors of both students and employees. Participation in all types of
    wholesome activities spiritual, academic, social, and cultural promotes the positive
    interactions that bring about a righteous sociality capable of enduring throughout
    eternity.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">6. <b><i>Service provides opportunities for growth.</i></b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Only those individuals who lose themselves in meaningful
    service to others can ever discover who they really are. True service both blesses the one
    being served and provides unparalleled opportunities for personal growth and development
    to the one doing the serving. As students and staff fulfill callings in their respective
    wards and stakes, follow through with classroom, club, and other assignments, and carry
    out responsibilities in their homes, apartments, or elsewhere, they grow in character and
    in their commitment to become more like the Savior.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">7. <b><i>A Ricks College experience must be affordable for
    students and families.</i></b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">The efforts to provide unique teaching and learning
    experiences at Ricks College are of no avail if only an elite group, academically and
    economically, can ever come here. The cost of a Ricks experience must be kept within
    reasonable and affordable limits.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I believe that abiding by these principles will enable us to
    both preserve and enhance the spirit of Ricks College as we progress on our voyage of high
    adventure in a sea of rapid change.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">Brothers and sisters, you and I have come here today primarily
    to be in the presence of and receive counsel from the prophet of the Lord. We have also
    assembled to celebrate Ricks College and its influence for good. An inauguration ceremony
    is not about the particular person who occupies the office of president. Rather, the
    ceremony is a celebration of the institution and its wonderful people. I am grateful to be
    here with you today and to share in this historic and memorable occasion.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">As I now conclude, I would like to pay tribute to the people
    who make Ricks College what it is. Your faithfulness, dedication, and loyalty are a great
    source of inspiration to me. You have taught me much in the short time I have been with
    you. Elder Orson F. Whitney related the following relevant experience:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman"><i>A captain of a ship in a storm was approached and
    asked if there was any danger. The tempests had been beating upon the vessel for days; she
    had been driven out of her course; the waves were rolling mountain high; the appearance of
    things was perilous, and the passengers were fearful. &quot;Captain, is there
    danger?&quot; asked one. The Captain smiled reassuringly, and replied, &quot;Not one
    particle, so long as conditions remain as they now are. I have been down below; I have
    examined the machinery; every wheel is moving as it was ordained to move; every pin is in
    its place; every man is at his post; everything is working well, and as long as this
    continues, there is no danger whatever; but,&quot; he added, &quot;if a single wheel
    refused to move, if a single pin were out of place, if a man were to rebel and mutiny,
    there would be danger that we might all go to the bottom of the sea.</i> <font size="2"> (Orson F. Whitney,
    Conference Report, April 1907, p. 113)</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman">I, too, have been &quot;down below and examined the
    machinery&quot; of this great college during the past eight months. I am not suggesting
    that we are perfect, nor do I believe that every responsibility and job on this campus
    will always be executed exactly as it is today. Indeed, we have much room for continuing
    improvement. But the illustration by Elder Whitney is an appropriate model for how Ricks
    College will move forward majestically through the uncertainties that lie before us. The
    machinery and pins that must remain as they now are at Ricks College include our
    faithfulness to the Savior and His teachings, our loyalty to the Brethren, and our
    willingness to do more than is required or expected in serving the young people of the
    Church. As we progress on our voyage, there is no danger for Ricks College whatsoever as
    long as we preserve and enhance these essential conditions. Again quoting Elder
    Whitney:&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times Roman"><i>So long as we serve God, and are one with each
    other, the storms that come from without and spend their fury upon us, pass harmlessly
    over; they only have the effect of driving us together, making us feel for one another,
    love one another, and strengthen one another. </i><font size="2"> (Orson F. Whitney, Conference Report, April
    1907, p. 113)</font></font> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times Roman">May I now conclude by sharing with you my
    possession of greatest worth my testimony that God lives, my knowledge that Jesus is the
    Christ and that the fullness of the gospel has been restored to the earth in these latter
    days. I testify and witness that there are living prophets and apostles on the earth
    today. These things I know. Of these things I testify, and do so in the sacred name of
    Jesus Christ, amen.</font>

      THEM TO UNDERSTAND&quot;</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#004000"><strong>Ricks
    College Campus Education Week Devotional<br />
    June 4, 1998</strong> <br />
<strong>Elder David A. Bednar <br />
</strong><font size="2">© 1998 by Ricks College. All rights reserved</font><br wp="BR2" />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to be here with you today.
    A few ground rules as we begin: First, this will not be me talking at you as much as I
    hope it will be an invitation for the Spirit of the Holy Ghost to teach all of us. Second,
    if you have your scriptures, the rustling of the pages is sweet music to my ears. I
    recommend that if you have your scriptures you put them on your lap. You may even want to
    have a piece of paper and a pen--not to write down anything I will say, but to pay
    particular attention to and note the thoughts that will come to your mind and the feelings
    that will come to your heart. The Lord indicates in Section&nbsp;8 of the Doctrine and
    Covenants that revelation frequently comes as thoughts to the mind and feelings to the
    heart. So listening to me is not important, but paying attention to the promptings of the
    Holy Ghost is very important.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Please turn with me to Section 50 in the Doctrine and Covenants,
    verses 13 and 14: &quot;Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question--unto what were ye
    ordained? To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to
    teach the truth.&quot; I would draw your attention to a very important distinction in
    verse 14. When you and I are called to a position and set apart to serve in the Church,
    our responsibility is not to teach. It is to preach. The word preach in our contemporary
    vocabulary has some negative baggage associated with it. We think of people ranting and
    raving and pounding the pulpit; that is not it at all. Preaching is explaining and
    articulating the doctrine of Christ by the power of the Spirit. If you and I, as we are
    properly set apart, fulfill that responsibility, who then does the teaching? The answer is
    found in verse 14: &quot;Even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth.&quot;
    We are taught by the third member of the Godhead, even the Holy Ghost. That is why it is
    so important when we are assembled in a setting such as this to remember and heed the
    thoughts that come to our minds and the feelings that come to our hearts. They are put
    there by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost. That is the teaching we should respond to. So I
    invite that spirit and pray we will have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. I ask you to
    pray for me, even as I now pray for you, that we can have that spiritual gift as we are
    together during this period of time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000"><em>Every Home is a House of Learning.</em> As I have reflected
    on that theme from Elder Wirthlin, the question has come to my mind: &quot;Why is the home
    so crucial for gospel instruction?&quot; I think we would all agree that the home can and
    should be the most natural and the most effective setting for learning the gospel. I would
    simply pose this one question: &quot;Why?&quot; Let me suggest a few thoughts that have
    come to my mind as I have reflected on this question.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">The first reason is the home is the only place where we cannot
    hide from who we really are. Brother Mack Shirley said some very kind things about Sister
    Bednar and me today. I work with Brother Shirley; I sign his checks. He has to say nice
    things about me. Now, I will tell you what the natural man in me would love to believe. I
    would love to believe that Brother Shirley is exactly right in all of those nice things he
    said. However, when I return to my home and talk with my wife or my 16-year-old son, they
    help me remember things as they really are.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">More than a year ago I received a phone call from Elder Henry B.
    Eyring. During the conversation he asked me this question: &quot;Elder Bednar, we are in
    the process of identifying a new president for Ricks College. Would you be interested in
    being considered?&quot; I said, &quot;I would be delighted to learn about the position and
    be considered.&quot; He then said, &quot;Good. Let's get right to business. You and your
    wife need to be in Salt Lake City tomorrow.&quot; I called my wife and said, &quot;Susan,
    I just got a call from Elder Eyring. We have to be in Salt Lake City tomorrow.&quot; She
    said, &quot;David, for 23 years you have been teasing me. This is the biggest hoax you
    have ever tried to pull, and I am not buying it!&quot; It took me almost 15 minutes to
    convince Susan that I was not kidding and that we really had to make arrangements to get
    to Salt Lake City. That evening at dinner I said to our youngest son, &quot;Jeffrey, I
    received a call from Elder Eyring today. Mom and I will be traveling to Salt Lake City to
    be interviewed about the possibility of moving to Rexburg, Idaho, to become the president
    of Ricks College.&quot; He took about five seconds, looked at me, and said, &quot;Dad,
    there have to be a lot of men in the Church better qualified for that job than you!&quot;
    Other people who do not know me well might have thought, &quot;He seems to be a likely
    candidate for that job.&quot; My son was saying, &quot;Are you kidding me? My dad?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">What does this experience illustrate about learning gospel
    principles in the home? Truth is knowledge of things as they really were, as they really
    are, and as they really will be. You learn the truth about yourself in the home, and you
    cannot hide from the truths that you do not want to see and that you do not want to be
    reminded of. Sometimes that can be very painful. Sometimes we do not deal with that
    reality very well. But in the home we cannot hide from it. Consequently, confronting
    truths about ourselves that we might prefer to avoid nurtures the process of continuing
    individual repentance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Brother Shirley may say, &quot;Elder Bednar does a particular
    thing very well.&quot; Yet my wife knows I did not do that particular thing very well this
    morning. Knowing that I cannot hide from who I really am when I am with my wife and my
    children produces in me a desire to be better than I would ordinarily be.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">So why is the home potentially the most natural and most
    effective setting for learning the gospel? Because there we find the truth about
    ourselves, and we cannot hide from it.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">We are going to spend some time in the scriptures to identify the
    second reason why the home is the best place to learn gospel principles. The Savior
    emphatically emphasized the home as a special setting for the learning of gospel doctrine
    and principles. Please turn to 3&nbsp;Nephi, Chapter 17. As we go through this series of
    verses, we are going to focus on a word. I will highlight that word when we get to it. You
    will recall that in Chapter 17 the Savior is teaching the people in the Land of Bountiful
    near the temple. This is one of the most powerful chapters in all of holy writ. Beginning
    in verse 1:</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Behold, now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these
      words he looked round about again on the multitude, and he said unto them: Behold, my time
      is at hand.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot <em>understand</em>
      all my words . . .</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000"><em>Understand</em> is the word I want to draw to our attention.
    Notice that the Savior, even in the midst of his preaching, was aware that the people
    could not understand all that was being presented.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">. . . ye cannot <em>understand</em> all my words which I am
      commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things
      which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may <em>understand</em>, and
      prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again. (3&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;17:1-3, <em>emphasis
      added</em>)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">What a marvelous formula! (1) Go to your home, (2) ponder upon
    the things that have been said, (3) ask of the Father in Christ's name that you will
    understand, and (4) prepare your mind for additional instruction.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Even though the most powerful teacher who ever lived was in their
    midst and instructing these people, yet He, Jesus Christ, recognized that true
    understanding would come in the home. I find it powerful and significant that Christ
    emphasized the setting of the home as the place for understanding the doctrines of the
    gospel.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Now turn to Section 68 in the Doctrine and Covenants. I want to
    link together a series of verses that we all know and are familiar with. Perhaps we have
    not examined carefully the word <em>understand</em> in these verses. Brace yourself,
    because I am about to preach a hard doctrine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">And again, inasmuch as parents have children of her stakes which
      are organized, that teach them not to <em>understand</em> the doctrine of repentance,
      faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost
      by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the
      parents.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any
      of her stakes which are organized. (D&amp;C 68:25-26, <em>emphasis added</em>)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Here is the hard doctrine. It does not say to teach our children.
    Teaching is an activity. It says that we should teach them to understand. Understanding is
    an outcome; it is a result. It is easy for us to say, &quot;I teach my children in the
    home.&quot; That is not the job we have been assigned. That is not the admonition. It says
    that we are to teach them to understand.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Here is the question that follows this hard doctrine. &quot;Can
    any parent ever ensure or guarantee that a child will understand?&quot; The answer is,
    &quot;No.&quot; Let's go back to Section&nbsp;50 and continue with what we have read about
    the process of learning by the Spirit. We have already read verses 13 and 14. This entire
    section describes the process whereby he that preacheth and he that receiveth, when they
    do so under the influence of the Holy Ghost, are edified and rejoice together. There is
    one other important outcome. Can you guess what it is? They <em>understand</em> each
    other. Let's go to verse 17 in Section 50:</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth
      to preach the word of truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he preach it by
      the Spirit of truth or some other way?</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">And if it be by some other way it is not of God.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he
      that receiveth the word by the Spirt of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit
      of truth?</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, <em>understand</em>
      one another, and both are edified and rejoice together. (D&amp;C 50:17-18, 21-22, <em>emphasis
      added</em>)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I believe, brothers and sisters, that Section 68 verses 25-26 are
    an admonition for parents to create a home that is a house of learning wherein the Spirit
    of the Holy Ghost can reside. In such a home the Holy Ghost can teach the children to
    understand. It is not the parents who do the teaching. The parents have a role; they
    create, invite, and facilitate. But who ultimately is the teacher? The Spirit of the Holy
    Ghost. And it is teaching by the Spirit that produces understanding.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I think each of these scriptures points to the home as a context
    for teaching by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost. Within a Christ-centered home, love, trust,
    and confidence invite the Spirit of the Holy Ghost. I believe these scriptures highlight
    the importance of creating a home wherein the Holy Ghost can do the teaching. As parents
    we have the responsibility to establish that type of house of learning.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I would like to draw your attention to the second chapter of
    Mosiah. Before we read these verses, I would ask you to think about King Benjamin. As
    people came to hear him preach, how were they organized? They were in their families.
    Isn't that interesting? Let's look for a pattern. The Savior said, &quot;Go to your homes.
    Ponder.&quot; I believe the pattern includes discussion in our families about the things
    that have been preached. The admonition in Section 50 is to preach by the Spirit. The
    instruction, even the commandment, we receive in Section 68 is to teach our children to
    understand. Both passages highlight the same pattern of creating a Christ-centered,
    spirit-filled house of learning so that the Holy Ghost can teach and testify.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Let's read Chapter 2 in Mosiah beginning with verse 5:</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they
      pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his
      wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the
      eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man
      having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain
      in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them; (Mosiah
      2:5-6)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">What is the word we are zeroing in on? Understand. Watch for it
      in verse 9:</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written,
      saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my
      words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up
      hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me,
      and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may <em>understand</em>, and
      your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view. (Mosiah 2:9, <em>emphasis
      added</em>)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">In the home, where you cannot hide from who you really are, where
    love and confidence and trust invite the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, our ears can be opened
    that we may hear, our hearts may be opened that we understand as we are taught by the
    Spirit of the Holy Ghost, and our minds are opened that the mysteries of God may be
    unfolded to our view. Is it a coincidence that Section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants
    emphasizes revelation coming to the mind and the heart and here King Benjamin says that
    our hearts and our minds will be opened to behold the mysteries of God?</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Brothers and sisters, I think opening our minds and hearts is
    part of the emphasis Elder Wirthlin has suggested in our theme, <em>Every Home is a House
    of Learning</em>. May I suggest just a few things that we can do to create that kind of
    home.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">First, understand and love the doctrine of Christ. As I travel
    around the Church, I find the word &quot;doctrine&quot; is not very well understood.
    Sometimes we think doctrine refers to weird, abstract, mysterious subjects in the gospel
    of Jesus Christ. As I refer to doctrine, I am not talking about how many light-years it is
    to Kolob and who lives there. Rather, doctrine refers to the eternal, unchanging, and
    simple truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There are several key words in that
    definition: eternal, unchanging, simple, and truth. Doctrines are never altered. They
    never vary. They will always be the same. You can always count on them. There is, for
    example, the doctrine of the Atonement. There is doctrine related to priesthood and
    priesthood keys. There is doctrine related to continuing revelation and the pattern
    whereby our Heavenly Father communicates with us and we communicate with Him. These are
    eternal, unchanging truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">There are also principles. Principles are doctrinally based
    guidelines for what we ought to do. Therefore, if there is a doctrine of the Atonement,
    then the first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Repentance is
    the second principle or doctrinally based guideline for how we should live. Both of these
    principles are linked to the doctrine of the Atonement. Brothers and sisters, doctrine
    answers the why questions of our lives. Principles provide us with direction about the
    what and the how. May I suggest that in the times in which we live, only the restored
    gospel of Jesus Christ has the answers to the why questions that matter the most.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Susan and I have lived in the mission field all of our adult
    lives, and we have encountered marvelous people in other denominations who do many of the
    right things but do not fully understand why. It concerns me as I see young people in our
    Church who know all the correct things they should do and do not have a clue as to why.
    They have a check-list mentality. &quot;Say my prayers morning and night. Read the
    scriptures.&quot; Why do they do these things? &quot;Because I am supposed to. Because the
    prophet said. Because my mom and dad will jump my case if I don't.&quot; May I suggest
    that each of these activities is related to the doctrine of revelation. We pray every
    morning in a meaningful way to invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost. At the end of
    the day we report and give an account of our stewardship in our evening prayer. We express
    gratitude for the companionship of the Spirit and the direction we received. We also study
    the scriptures daily to feast upon the words of Christ, to again invite the Spirit, and to
    receive instruction and direction. These things are related to the doctrine of receiving
    revelation. But do we do these things without an understanding of what they are linked to
    doctrinally? Do we understand why? If we do not understand the why, then the power
    available to us through the doctrine of Christ will not be evident in our lives.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">This is particularly true with young people pertaining to the law
    of chastity. They know they shouldn't, but do they know why they shouldn't? Where is the
    best place to teach the why of chastity? In our homes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Here is another hard doctrine. Maybe you and I do not
    &quot;preach&quot; doctrine in our homes as frequently or as effectively as we should
    because we do not know the doctrine as well as we should.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I do not know a young person who truly understands the doctrine
    related to &quot;the seed of Abraham&quot; who would violate the law of chastity. We were
    foreordained in the premortal existence to the blessings associated with birth through a
    particular lineage, even the chosen lineage of Abraham--not because we are better, not
    because we are more special, but because we have particular responsibilities that we
    covenanted we would fulfill. Therefore we came to the earth through a lineage with the
    birthright blessing of the priesthood. Every man who holds the priesthood was foreordained
    to that very responsibility in the premortal existence. Does a young man who understands
    that doctrine have a choice to go on a mission? He made that choice before he was ever
    born.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">We come to the earth as the seed of Abraham to participate in
    blessing the families of the earth. Father Abraham was given the promise that through him
    and through his posterity, which is us, all the families of the earth would be blessed.
    How? By our bearing this ministry, which is the responsibility to proclaim the gospel, and
    this priesthood, meaning the saving ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have
    promised that we will carry this message to the nations of the earth. Brothers and
    sisters, you and I were born to spend our lives proclaiming the gospel and serving others.
    Might I suggest that if you are 65, retired, and thinking about serving a mission, you
    made that choice before you were ever born. It is through the lineage of Abraham that we
    came to the earth. Blessing others by proclaiming the gospel is what we were born to do.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">As I have opportunities to visit with young people, I like to
    talk about what it means to be the &quot;seed of Abraham.&quot; Hoping that the Spirit of
    the Lord will touch their hearts, I highlight the story of Jacob and Esau. Esau gave up
    his birthright blessing for a bowl of red bean soup. Now a question directed to the young
    people: Would you really want to forfeit your birthright as the seed of
    Abraham--foreordained in the premortal existence, living on the earth at this particular
    time to bless the families of the earth, the most glorious spiritually destiny you could
    ever hope for? Do you really want to give up those blessings and opportunities for a few
    minutes of messing around? If we understand the doctrine of who we are and why we are
    here, then that understanding changes the way we do things.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Listen to this statement from President Boyd K. Packer:
    &quot;True doctrine understood changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines
    of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve
    behavior&quot; (Boyd K. Packer, &quot;Little Children,&quot; <u>Ensign</u>, November 1986,
    pg. 17).</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I do not intend to be harsh, but in Relief Society, priesthood,
    Young Men's, and Young Women's we sometimes have lessons on topics such as self-esteem,
    self-worth, and goal setting. Such instruction indeed can be good and valuable. But you
    can get the same information at the Rotary Club or a number of other secular
    organizations. However, at the Rotary Club you cannot get the pure, simple doctrine of the
    Atonement of Christ. And self-esteem and the ability to effectively set and accomplish
    goals ultimately comes from understanding doctrine, not just the mechanics of application.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Listen to this statement from President Ezra Taft Benson:</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the
      outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of
      people and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by
      changing their environment. Christ changes men who then change their environment. The
      world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature. (<u>Teachings of
      Ezra Taft Benson</u>, pg. 79)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">As parents, how do we get inside? This is the challenge because
    we have the responsibility to teach our children to understand. If the Lord works from the
    inside out, can a parent get inside? The answer was found in Section 50. You and I preach.
    And I do not mean rant and rave and pound the pulpit. We articulate, we explain, we set a
    worthy example, and we testify of the simple doctrine of Christ--particularly in our
    homes--so the Spirit of the Holy Ghost can teach, bringing thoughts to the mind and
    feelings to the heart. That is how the Lord gets inside. In essence, you and I have the
    opportunity to be the vessel or vehicle through whom the Spirit can come and touch the
    hearts of those whom we love.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Finally, this statement from President Marion G. Romney:</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">The only safety we have in the world for our children is what
      they build within themselves. We can make restrictions against drinking and smoking, and
      we can make regulations to guide the affairs of people. We can throw all the protections
      possible around them. But after all, the thing that holds them in, the final test, is what
      is inside of them. They must be able to stand alone. (F.&nbsp;Burton Howard, <u>Marion G.
      Romney: His Life and Faith</u>, pg. 153)</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">If they know the why, they will quickly learn the how. Am I
    suggesting that we never discuss the how? Not at all. I am suggesting that perhaps we do
    not spend as much time with the why as we need to. As a stake president, I interviewed
    many, many people about their family home evenings and what they did during that time
    together. For many members, it was Monday night football and donuts. They would talk in
    our interviews about the wonderful, fun activities they had together as families. Having
    fun activities is right, and good, and true. But it is not enough. Anybody can have fun as
    a family. Anybody can go to the park. But if with small children in the park there are
    even two or three minutes devoted to a simple illustration about a doctrine or a principle
    and a pure testimony expressed by a parent, there comes into the mind and into the heart
    of those children understanding that will bear eternal fruit. I fear there is not enough
    focus on doctrine in our homes. We should each evaluate our ability to preach the doctrine
    more effectively to our families in our homes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">As I interviewed members of the Church, frequently I would
    inquire, &quot;Tell me about personal and family prayer in your home.&quot; &quot;Well,
    President, we know we should do that but we don't do it as consistently as we ought
    to.&quot; &quot;How about family scripture study?&quot; &quot;It just seems that with our
    hectic schedules as we all go in different directions, we just never seem to get that
    done.&quot; Then, without trying to be too biting or too pointed, I would ask,
    &quot;Please help me understand what it is in your life that is so important that you
    cannot make time for these spiritually essential activities.&quot; These activities invite
    the Spirit of the Holy Ghost. It is not just a matter of checking them off a &quot;to
    do&quot; list so we do not feel guilty. It is a matter of inviting the spirit of
    revelation and the protection of the Holy Ghost for me, for you, and for our children.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Brothers and sisters, think of the total amount of time in a week
    devoted to doctrinally based, spirit-filled instruction for our young people through the
    programs of the Church. Let's assume they go to seminary. That might yield three or four
    hours of quality instruction during the course of the week. What would they receive in
    church on Sunday? Thirty minutes in sacrament meeting; thirty minutes in Sunday School;
    and thirty minutes in Young Men's, Young Women's, or Gospel Doctrine. A total of maybe
    five, six, or seven hours for the entire week, if we are optimistic. Think of the evil
    influences in the world. Will the Church and its programs alone safeguard you and me and
    our children in an increasingly wicked world? The answer is no. Please do not
    misunderstand this statement--I would not trust my children exclusively to the programs of
    the Church. I love the Church, but the Church operates as a support to you and to me as we
    create a home that is a house of learning. First and foremost, the responsibility is ours
    as parents to create a Christ-centered, spirit-filled home environment where the Holy
    Ghost can teach and testify to our children. If they know the why, they will quickly learn
    the how.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">Brothers and sisters, with all the energy of my soul, I express
    appreciation for being here with you today. I have gained much from your faith as you have
    assembled here. I hope the Spirit has instructed each of us in things we can do better to
    follow the admonition of Elder Wirthlin to create a home that is a house of learning.</font></p>
<p><font color="#004000">I testify that Jesus is the Christ. I know He lives. I know He
    appeared with his Father to the boy prophet Joseph Smith. And I testify the living Savior
    directs the affairs of His living church through apostles and prophets in these latter
    days. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -15px"> <font size="2" color="#000080">Ricks College Devotional<br />		September 1, 1998</font><font color="#000080"><br />&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would prefer to say the things I want to say to you today in a
    one-on-one setting. Perhaps we would be seated in my office, or in a classroom, or in some
    other location where we could listen and talk without distractions or interruptions. The
    message I want to share today is very important--and is one I have been thinking about all
    summer. If we are to understand each other this afternoon, we will all need to participate
    in this devotional under the influence of the Holy Ghost. I pray for and invite the
    companionship of the third member of the Godhead for all of us.&nbsp;		<br />&nbsp; <br />Every month I am interviewed on KWBH, our student-operated radio
    station on campus, and I answer student call-in questions. One question I have been asked
    several times is this: &quot;<i>President, is there a particular message you would like to
    convey to the students who are listening</i>?&quot;&nbsp; <br />		&nbsp; <br />My answer is always the same: &quot;<b><i>I hope the students will
    work and strive to understand what a privilege it is to attend Ricks College</i></b>.&quot;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some of you may wonder why I refer to the opportunity of being a
    student at Ricks as a &quot;<i>privilege.</i>&quot; Let me provide two major reasons why
    attending Ricks is a privilege.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;		<br />Reason #1: Sacred tithing funds make it possible for you to be here.
    The price you pay for tuition and fees is only a small percentage of the actual cost of
    your educational experience at Ricks. Literally, the widow's mite, contributed from
    faithful Church members around the world, makes it possible for you to be here.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Reason #2: Approximately 100,000 LDS seniors graduated from high
    schools in North America last spring--and less than 10,000 can be admitted to a church
    college or university. Consequently, many worthy and capable young men and women were
    denied admission to Ricks and BYU.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>In summary, then, attending Ricks College is both a 		<u>privilege</u>
    and a <u>responsibility</u></b>.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">On one of my stake conference assignments several years ago, long
    before I knew much about or became the president of Ricks College, I stayed in the home of
    a good stake president. He and his wife had been blessed with eight children, and seven of
    those children previously had attended Ricks College. The ultimate dream of the eighth
    child, who was 17 years old at the time, was to attend Ricks College as her brothers and
    sisters had done. I was present in their home the day that last child opened the letter
    from the Admissions Office indicating she had been denied admission to Ricks College. This
    young woman was so worthy, so qualified academically, and so desirous. But there simply
    was not enough room that year at Ricks to accommodate all of the good young people in the
    Church who wanted to attend. She was so disappointed. I shall never forget the things I
    saw and felt in that home that afternoon. And you should know my experience with that
    worthy young woman and many others like her who are not admitted into Ricks College has a
    significant impact on how I view you students who have been admitted into and are now
    attending Ricks College.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The scene I have just described was replayed in more than a
    thousand homes last spring as faithful and worthy young people received similar letters
    from our Admissions Office. Consider also that tithing paid by the families whose children
    were denied admission makes it possible for you to be here. Let me emphasize
    again--attending school at Ricks is both a <u>privilege</u> and a <u>responsibility</u>.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The major theme for my comments this afternoon is found in James
    1:8. &quot;<i>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways</i>.&quot; My objective
    today is to review both the doctrine and principles related to integrity and honesty. As
    the verse in James suggests, I am going to begin by defining the opposite of
    integrity.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">In my study of the scriptures, I have come across four extremely
    interesting phrases:&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; <b><i>Double minded </i></b>(James 1:8)&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; <b><i>Double heart </i></b>(I Chronicles 12:33; Psalms
    12:2)&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; <b><i>Divided heart </i></b>(Hosea 10:2)&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; <b><i>Double tongued </i></b>(JST 1 Timothy 3:8)&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Each of these verses describes the problems and consequences
    associated with saying one thing and doing another--with attempting to serve two
    masters--with dividing our loyalty and allegiance between God and the world. A few
    questions will highlight what I mean:&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; Do you and I think, talk, and act differently around our
    parents, our bishop, our teachers, and our friends?&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; Do you and I have a public face and a public language that
    are significantly different from our private face and private language?&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; Do you and I think, talk, and act differently in our
    classes on campus and in our church meetings on Sunday than we do in our apartments?&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">These questions strike at the heart of what I think the Lord
    intended with the phrases <b><i>double minded</i></b>, <b><i>double heart</i></b>, 		<b><i>divided
    heart</i></b>, and<b><i> double tongued</i></b>. You and I are double minded when who we
    really are, our thoughts, our speech, and our behavior, vary according to where we are and
    with whom we are associating. For example,&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; a <b>double heart</b> is when a young women wears shorter
    skirts to church on Sunday than she does to school during the week because she is less
    concerned about being confronted and getting caught at Church;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; a <b>divided heart</b> is when a young man removes his
    earring and puts it in his pocket before entering a class and then puts it on again as
    quickly as he can once he leaves the classroom;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; <b>double minded</b> is signing the honor code and then
    trying to find an off-campus apartment complex where you believe the curfew will not be
    strictly observed--where a student thinks he or she can break a commitment and not get
    caught; and&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />		&#149; <b>double tongued</b> is partaking of the sacrament on Sunday
    and publicly proclaiming in a testimony meeting a desire to have the constant
    companionship of the Holy Ghost--then routinely watching &quot;R&quot; rated and other
    inappropriate movies and rationalizing that such movies are &quot;. . . <i>ok because they
    contain just one bad part, and I can handle it.&quot;</i>&nbsp; <br />		&nbsp; <br />In essence, then, double mindedness is hypocrisy. And the Savior and
    his apostles had some very sharp and stern things to say about hypocrisy and
    hypocrites.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />		Compare, if you will, the notion of double mindedness to the
    following verses:&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>And faith, hope, charity and love, with <b>an eye single to
      the glory of God,</b> qualify him for the work (D&amp;C 4:5; emphasis added).&nbsp;  </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>And if <b>your eye be single to my glory,</b> your whole
      bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body
      which is filled with light comprehendeth all things</i>&nbsp; <br />			(D&amp;C 88:67; emphasis added).&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in
      heart. Look unto God with <b>firmness of mind</b>, and pray unto him with exceeding faith,
      and he will console you in your afflictions . . . </i>(Jacob 3:1; emphasis added).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp; <br />When we have an eye single to the glory of God and are striving to
    align our will with His will, then we are on the way to developing the trait of integrity.
    In the language of the scriptures, our minds are becoming firm.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">One way of defining integrity is (1) the alignment of our
    personal desires with the will of God and (2) a consistency of what we think, what we say,
    and what we do across different settings. Please note in Mosiah 4:30 the eternal
    significance of our thoughts, our speech, and our actions.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch
      yourselves, and your <b>thoughts</b>, and your <b>words</b>, and your <b>deeds</b>, and
      observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard
      concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And
      now, O man, remember, and perish not (emphasis added).&nbsp;			<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">If we have integrity and are honest, then we think and speak and
    act the same way in front of our bishop, in front of our parents, in front of our
    teachers, and in front of our friends--in both public and private settings.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">As a student at Ricks College, you have a remarkable opportunity
    to develop integrity. And two of the tools that will help you on this journey are the
    honor and dress codes.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Throughout the scriptures reference is made to two overarching
    levels of spiritual development: the preparatory level and the higher level. For
    example,&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; the law of Moses preceded and was a preparation for the
    law of the gospel that the Savior taught;&nbsp; <br />		&nbsp; <br />&#149; the Aaronic Priesthood precedes and is a preparation for the
    Melchizedek Priesthood;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; we must understand and obey the letter of the law before
    we can obtain the spirit of the law; and&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#149; as Paul taught, we must first digest spiritual milk before
    we are ready for spiritual meat.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;		<br />My dear young brothers and sisters, the honor and dress codes are
    not obstacles designed by out-of-touch old people to hassle you during your time on the
    Ricks College campus. Rather, <b>the honor code is a lesser law preparation to enter the
    house of the Lord and make sacred covenants, and the dress code is a lesser law
    preparation for how you will dress and should act after you have entered into those
    covenants</b>. If you struggle at Ricks College to obey the lesser and preparatory
    guidelines contained in the honor and dress codes, then may I candidly suggest that you
    will not be prepared to make those covenants in the temple.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">If you have already entered into these sacred covenants in the
    temple, the honor and dress codes serve as a partial measurement of how well you are
    honoring and keeping those covenants. I emphasize that students who have previously
    entered into these covenants (returned missionaries and married students) have a
    particular and weighty responsibility to set a worthy example for those who are preparing
    and learning. As we learn in the 82nd section of the Doctrine and Covenants,<i> &quot;For
    of him unto whom much is given much is required&quot;</i> (verse 3).&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">All of you young men who are freshmen should look forward to
    serving as full-time missionaries for the Church. As you prepare to go to the temple, you
    will be interviewed by your bishop and stake president. One of the questions you will be
    asked is this:<i> &quot;Are you totally honest in your dealings with your fellow
    men?&quot;</i> Young men, if you consistently and willfully violate the honor and dress
    codes during your freshman year here, you will not be able to look your bishop and stake
    president in the eye and in good conscience answer &quot;<i>yes</i>&quot; to that
    question. Now is the time to begin preparing for that interview.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Young men and women, some of you may meet a worthy companion
    during this academic year and desire to enter the house of the Lord to be sealed together
    for time and all eternity. If you treat the lesser law preparation of the honor and dress
    codes with casualness and impunity, then you will have trouble answering affirmatively the
    honesty question from your bishop and stake president. Now is the time to begin preparing
    for that interview.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">How you feel about and respond to the honor and dress codes are
    excellent indicators of how you are doing in preparing to go to the temple; they also
    provide powerful evidence of how well we are honoring the covenants we have already
    made.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />		Much discussion occurs on this campus about the topic of enforcing
    the honor and dress codes. Focusing upon enforcement totally misses the issue and
    emphasizes a symptom of the problem rather than the root cause of the problem. The
    solution to this issue is really very simple. We do not need more or better enforcement.
    We simply need more obedience. You can read and understand these codes; that is all that
    should be necessary. An endless checklist of what can and cannot be done, what can and
    cannot be worn, is contrary to the spirit of the honor code.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Turn with me to Mosiah 4: 29. In this verse we learn that King
    Benjamin also was unwilling to provide an extensive checklist of do's and don'ts for his
    people.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may
      commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Disobedience is the root cause of the problem. Ineffective
    enforcement is merely a symptom of this much larger and important problem. Enforcement is
    control that comes from &quot;<i>outside</i>&quot; of us and can never be effective.
    Obedience is submission to the will of God that comes from &quot;<i>within</i>&quot; us
    and brings the blessings of heaven.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please turn with me to 2 Nephi 2:14.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your
      profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens
      and the earth, and all things that in them are, both <b>things to act</b> and 			<b>things to
      be acted upon</b> (emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp; <br />The question we may ask is this: What things are to act and what
    things are to be acted upon? The answer is found in verse 16 of the same chapter.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto <b>man</b> that he <b>should
      act for himself</b>. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he
      was enticed by the one or the other (emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Men and women are to act and not be acted upon. Obedience as
    submission from &quot;<i>within</i>&quot; is acting for ourselves. Enforcement as control
    from &quot;<i>outside</i>&quot; is being acted upon.&nbsp; <br />		&nbsp; <br />Highlighting a similar theme, President Marion G. Romney
    taught:&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>The only safety we have in the world for our children is what
      they build within themselves. We can make restrictions against drinking and smoking, and
      we can make regulations to guide the affairs of people. We can throw all the protections
      possible around them, but after all, the thing that holds them in the final test is what
      is inside of them. They must be able to stand alone. (Howard F. Burton, MARION G.
      ROMNEY: HIS LIFE AND FAITH, pg. 153)&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am convinced that students violate the honor and dress codes
    for two and only two reasons: (1) they either do not understand the codes, or (2) they
    choose to willfully rebel.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;		<br />To the students who perhaps did not read and understand the codes
    thoroughly at the time you signed and committed to live by them, you now have the
    responsibility to study, understand, and live them. That is the commitment you made when
    you signed the honor code. I pledge that our faculty and staff will do all in our power to
    help you in this learning process.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">To the few students who perhaps plan to willfully rebel, I invite
    you to go somewhere else to attend college. You will not be happy here, and you have no
    claim upon the resources of the Church. The place you occupy should rightfully be made
    available to a deserving young man or woman who will appreciate and benefit from the
    Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />		The test of the honor and dress codes is not whether you get caught
    or if they are consistently enforced. The absolute test of the honor and dress codes is
    how a student thinks and talks and acts when no one is around to enforce the codes--when
    no one is checking. The question, then, is whether we will enforce in our own lives that
    which is ultimately unenforceable. The honor and dress codes are a lesser law test of
    integrity and honesty.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;		<br />The honor and dress codes measure you and me, and what we may
    perceive as an apparent inconsistency of application or lack of enforcement does not
    invalidate the importance of that measurement.&nbsp; <br />		&nbsp; <br />You may listen to my comments and conclude that I do not believe
    Ricks students heed the honor and dress codes. Let me be just as clear as I can be. The
    overwhelming majority of our Ricks students understand what I have just described and are
    striving to obey the honor and dress codes with full purpose of heart. You who are so
    abiding these preparatory laws are described in Helaman 15:5-6:&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>And I would that ye should behold that t<b>he more part of
      them are in the path of their duty,</b> and they do walk circumspectly before God, and
      they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according to
      the law of Moses.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;			<br /><i>Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this,
      and <b>they are striving with unwearied diligence </b>that they may bring the remainder of
      their brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many who do add to their
      numbers daily </i>(emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As described in verse 6, we have a covenant obligation to both
    obey the honor and dress codes ourselves and to assist others in so living. Our objective
    is not to become the ultimate enforcers; rather, it is to encourage and help everyone in
    our community of Saints here at Ricks College to honor and abide by our commitments.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">We do not want an environment on this campus characterized by
    self-appointed, judgmental, and self-righteous spiritual vigilantes. We do want an
    environment on this campus where appropriately and genuinely concerned &quot;<i>neighbors</i>,&quot;
    in the true scriptural sense of the word neighbor, would remind, help, and encourage us to
    consistently think, speak, and act in a way that invites the Spirit of the Holy Ghost
    among us.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">A double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways. If you came
    to Ricks College under false pretenses, if you were not totally honest with your bishop in
    your worthiness interview, you need to repent. The Holy Ghost and your bishop here on
    campus can help you overcome double mindedness and develop an eye single to the glory of
    God. Please do not wait. Please do not procrastinate the day of your repentance. Prepare
    yourself totally now so you can receive the blessings the Lord has in store for you while
    you are a student at Ricks College.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Please turn with me now to 2 Nephi 31: 10-13. In chapter 31 Nephi
    describes why Christ was baptized and outlines the fundamental elements of the doctrine of
    Christ. Beginning in verse 10:&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.
      Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the
      commandments of the Father?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;			<br /><i>And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the
      name of my Beloved son.</i>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;			<br /><i>And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is
      baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore,
      follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</i>&nbsp;			<br />&nbsp; <br /> <i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow
      the Son, with full purpose of heart, <b>acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God,
      but with real intent</b> . . . </i>(emphasis added)&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp; <br />Note the specific reference to no hypocrisy and no deception before
    God. Now, notice the footnote that links the phrase &quot;. . . <b><i>with real intent</i></b>
    . . .&quot; to the topical guide. To what topic is the phrase &quot;. . . <b> <i>with real
    intent</i></b> . . .&quot; linked? Integrity. Thus, we can also read verse 13 as: &quot;.
    . . <i>ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no
    deception before God, but with <b>integrity</b></i> . . . &quot;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are
      willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord and
      your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the
      Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye
      speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel 			(2
      Nephi 31:13).&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Brothers and sisters, we must learn to follow the Son with
    real intent, with true integrity, with minds that are firm, and overcome our tendency to
    be double-minded. Doing so will bring peace, joy, and happiness beyond description. I
    testify that these principles I have discussed today are true. I know that God the Eternal
    Father lives. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our Savior and Redeemer.
    And I know and witness that the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored
    to the earth in this latter-day dispensation through the prophet Joseph Smith. This is a
    living church directed by a living Savior through true apostles and prophets. These things
    I know, and of these things I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; </font> </p>
