</p>
<p><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a wonderful thing to be with you, to welcome you to a new
semester at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. Over the last few months, Sister Clark and I have come to know and
appreciate you and the great spirit that is on this campus. This is a very special place of faith,
devotion, and obedience. It is a school of inspired learning and teaching, a place where the Lord
prepares true disciples and trusted servants.
		<br /> </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to talk today about principles that are central to the special character of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho,
and central to your lives now, and to the glorious future that awaits you. These principles are laid
out in a beautiful and powerful way in the 64<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let&#8217;s turn
to that section and read together verses 33 and 34:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.
And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient
shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In these short verses the Lord teaches principles that have profound implications for you and for
me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Well-doing occurs through small things; great things come from small things. It is natural to
grow weary in doing small things; but if we give our hearts and minds to the Lord, we will not
grow weary, we will do the small things that make great things happen, and we will build Zion. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to focus today on how small things bring about that which is great, and what it
means to give our hearts and minds to the Lord. I want to apply these principles to BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho
and, specifically, to the Honor Code.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Small to Great: Two Patterns</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the scriptures there are two patterns of the principle that small things lead to great things. In
the first pattern, the Lord&#8217;s work gets done in small miracles and simple acts of kindness,
service, and obedience sustained over long periods of time. Alma taught this pattern and the
principle to his son Helaman in the 37<sup>th</sup> chapter of Alma. Speaking of the brass plates, Alma
said:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to
pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes . . .</i>
(Alma 37:6-7).<br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">This principle is at work all around us. We grow personally and the kingdom grows through
small things sustained. There are many examples: an act of kindness, an invitation to church, a
word of testimony, a family prayer, an inspired verse. Sustained over time, these become a
source of great power and influence for righteousness and good. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">It is also true, however, that this principle works in the other direction as well. Small acts of
disobedience or meanness, sustained over time, lead to great evil and destruction. This we also
know. Listen to Nephi&#8217;s description of Satan and his evil designs:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-right: 0.25in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance</i> (2
Nephi 28:21-22).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />There is a second pattern of small things leading to great things, less talked about, perhaps less
well understood. And yet it, too, is in operation all around us. In this second pattern small things
lead to great things quite suddenly, even dramatically. Let me illustrate this pattern with two
diagrams. </font></p>
<p>
<img border="1" src="2006_01.jpg" width="300" height="224" align="left" hspace="20" /><font color="#000080">The first diagram simulates the number of people who would die from a deadly, infectious
disease in a population. The disease grows very slowly, but persistently. Then, when the number
of infected people gets to a critical point, the number who die increases dramatically and we
have a full-fledged epidemic.
		</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
<img border="1" src="2006_02.jpg" width="300" height="228" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" /></p>
<p align="left">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#000080">The second diagram depicts the number of deaths in Kansas in October of 1918 during the
worldwide flu epidemic. Here, in an actual epidemic, we see the same pattern&#8212;slow
development when the disease first hits and then a dramatic increase once the disease gets to a
critical point.</font></p>
<p align="left">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#000080">This dramatic effect on the population depicted here comes about because of small things&#8212;a
little virus; a few people who transmit it; the few contact others, and they in turn contact a few
more until many have been infected. It is also small things that can stop the disease: reduce the
number of contacts people have; isolate those we know are infected; wash hands; don&#8217;t gather in
large meetings in closed places, and so forth.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The epidemic pattern&#8212;small things producing large, dramatic effects&#8212;shows up in many other
contexts. It is what lies behind fashion and fads in music and entertainment, dress and grooming,
and other aspects of social behavior. I first ran into this personally in the mid-1950s in the form
of the Hula Hoop. It seemed like almost overnight otherwise mature and sane people were
buying plastic hoops and gyrating everywhere. Today, you can find this pattern all around you, if
you look. Why, for example, would anyone who is not a catcher on a baseball team wear a
baseball cap backwards? It probably started in some obscure place by someone now long
forgotten. But that social behavior has swept across society, affecting millions of people.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">This pattern of dramatic change produced by small things is a pattern we see over and over again
in the Book of Mormon. Please turn with me to Alma chapter 4 and look at verses 6-12. Here we
find a description of a people descending into wickedness. It begins with small things, like the
wearing of expensive clothes, and pride in <i>&#8220;. . . all manner of precious things . . .&#8221; 
		</i>(verse 6), and
gossip, and unkind words. Look at verse 8, <i>&#8220;. . . the people of the church began to be lifted up in
the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world,
		<span style="font-weight: bold">that they began to be scornful, one towards another</span> . . .&#8221;<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span></i>(emphasis added).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Later in verse 11 Mormon tells us that wickedness in the Church led 
		<i>&#8220;. . . unbelievers on <span style="font-weight: bold">from
one piece of iniquity to another</span>, thus bringing on the destruction of the people&#8221; 
		</i>(emphasis
added). This great wickedness did not happen all at once. It began with small things, but these
small things grew into great evil in the space of a single year. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Book of Mormon also shows us how these epidemics of wickedness and evil may be
stopped. Some are stopped by war and great destruction. But in some, intervention by the
prophets of God works through small things to bring about great and dramatic repentance and
righteousness, also in a very short time. (See, for example, Helaman 5:50-52.)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe that Mormon included so many of these stories of the power of small things for a very
good reason. He saw our day and knew of the forces that would be at work on us in our time. We
live in a day when changes in fashion and fads in dress and grooming, in music and
entertainment, and social behavior of all kinds happen very quickly. Moreover, the media
through which all of this occurs is very powerful. Satan uses these forces in our day to wreak
havoc in our society, and thus bring about great evil. The Lord inspired Mormon to teach us
these principles that we might be warned and forewarned. The Lord also has given us the
admonition in the revelation we started with today: be not weary in well-doing. Well-doing can
stop the spread of the small things that lead to great evil. And it lays the foundation for great
righteousness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Which brings me to BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho and the Honor Code. The principles we have discussed are at
work on this campus. The Honor Code includes many things that we might describe as great:
honesty and integrity, avoiding pornography, living the law of chastity, and the Word of
Wisdom, indeed, the gospel of Jesus Christ. But it also contains many rules against things that
we might describe as small: flip-flops; curfew; torn or ragged jeans; long sideburns; shorts and capris; form-fitting tops and pants and other immodest styles; beards; &#8220;underwear styles&#8221; of
clothing; and much else. Some of you may wonder why we have such small things in the Honor
Code. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is true that flip-flops and an unshaven face are not big things. But it is just like the stories of
pride and greed in the Book of Mormon: failure to do the small things can, in a short period of
time, lead to failure on the big things. The principle is so very clear: obedience to the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">small</span>
things creates a spirit of obedience in <span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> things, and thus protects against evil and invites the
blessings of heaven. Following the rules about the small things establishes a great spirit of
obedience on the campus. It creates a context of respect for learning and for the university that
encourages a spirit of order and reverence. In that context of obedience and reverence and order,
the Holy Ghost can minister on this campus. These blessings come to you individually and to us
as a community. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is why we have such seemingly small things in the Honor Code. This is why such a small
thing like wearing flip-flops on campus or going to class with a little beard or breaking curfew is
so deadly. This is why if you are on campus and discover that you have on flip-flops, or realize
you have not shaved, the images of the great destruction in the Book of Mormon should come to
mind. You should immediately think to yourself: my small act of disobedience is opening a
crack in the great protective power of the Honor Code. I am personally in great danger; and if
everyone behaved like me, the community would be in peril. And then you should immediately
turn around, go back to your apartment, repenting as you go, and change your shoes, or shave,
and come back living both the letter and the spirit of the Honor Code. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is also why if you ever hear sarcastic words coming out of your mouth like: &#8220;So, what are
you, the Honor Code Nazi?&#8221; or &#8220;Why are you so dressed up?&#8221; or any other words of scorn and
ridicule directed at your classmates who are living the Honor Code, you should immediately
recall the words of Mormon, repent on the spot, apologize to them, and ask their forgiveness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br /> </font>
<img border="1" src="2006_03.jpg" width="300" height="226" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Because of its importance and its power in this community and in your life, I invite you to take a
personal inventory of your relationship to the Honor Code.&nbsp; In order to help you do this, I have
prepared what I call the Honor Code Map.&nbsp; The first dimension of the map is obedience to the letter of the Honor Code, represented by the
horizontal line. In the middle of the line, I have marked the boundary between obedience on the
right and disobedience on the left. The second dimension of the map is the spirit of the Honor
Code, represented by the vertical line. Above the horizontal line are those who live the spirit of
the Honor Code; below the line are those who do not. These two dimensions establish the four
quadrants of the Honor Code Map. As I explain each one, I want you to reflect on your own
situation. I want you to ask yourself: Where am I in the map, and where am I going? </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img border="1" src="2006_04.jpg" width="300" height="224" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" /></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Let&#8217;s begin in the upper left-hand quadrant. Students in this part of the map live the spirit, but
not the letter of the Honor Code. How is that possible? I believe this occurs when students desire
to do what is right, but do not know about or do not understand the standards. I will call this
quadrant the Zone of Ignorance.&nbsp; If you think you might be in this zone, I encourage you to get
educated. Go and read the Honor Code carefully. There are many people who will help you. The Zone of Ignorance is not a good place to be.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Moving counterclockwise, we come to the lower left-hand quadrant. Here are students who live
neither the letter, nor the spirit of the Honor Code. This is the Zone of Rebellion. Students in this
zone know the standards, and yet choose to willfully rebel against them. If you are in this zone, I
invite you to do one of two things. Number 1: repent and get out of the zone; in other words,
change your ways. You will find many around you willing to help you and support you,
including your bishop and the Lord. If you are in the Zone of Rebellion and do not want to
change, I invite you to do Number 2: attend another university. If you are in rebellion against the
Honor Code and if you persist in that rebellion, this is not the university for you. You have no
right to be here, and there are many worthy students who would like to take your place. It is not
good to be in the Zone of Rebellion.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The last quadrant is the one we all should strive to be in. I call this quadrant the Zone of
Discipleship. I am happy to say that the vast majority of students are in this quadrant. 
		</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="2006_05.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" /></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Students in the Zone of Discipleship are in compliance with the letter of the Honor Code, and
they live its spirit as well. Some, in the lower part of the zone, are at an early stage of their
discipleship and are working to live its principles more fully. As they do so, they travel the Path
of Discipleship. The same is true of those who take my invitation to get out of the Zones of
Ignorance, or Rebellion, or Hypocrisy. All students who seek to increase in obedience to the letter and to the spirit of the Honor Code travel the Path of Discipleship. They see the connection
between the small things and the things that are great. They understand the importance of
obedience, and they see the Honor Code as a preparation for the higher laws and covenants the
Lord desires to give them.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font color="#000080">It is my deep hope that all of you will move forward on the Path of Discipleship. Living the letter
and the spirit of the Honor Code requires vigilance and diligence and obedience. One of the
biggest challenges is exactly what the Lord warned us about in the 64<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine
and Covenants: we grow <i>&#8220;. . . weary in well-doing . . .&#8221; </i>(verse 33). There are always temptations
to let the Honor Code slide, even if only a little bit. It may be tempting to break curfew just a
little bit; to have your girlfriend or boyfriend in your bedroom so you can talk privately for just a
little while; to copy that one small paragraph from the Internet and present it as your own; to let
your beard grow on the weekends; to wear that stylish but low-cut sweater on Saturday night. It
may seem easier to dress down, to not shave, to slip on the flip-flops like an old habit, to wear
that old ragged pair of jeans that are so comfortable. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />Throughout the scriptures when the prophets talk about our relationship to the Lord, they often
use the image of the heart to capture something deep and profound in our very nature.
Physically, the heart pumps blood throughout the body, bringing life-giving oxygen and nutrients
to every part of us. It is there in the quiet times, even when we are asleep. It is there when we are
active, giving us whatever we need. We can feel it, and hear it, beating away, giving us life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">For all of these reasons, the prophets have used the image of the heart to capture what is at the
very core of our emotional and spiritual life&#8212;our innermost desires, our central drives, our
deepest emotional commitments, and our capacity for love. Like the physical heart that delivers
life-giving blood to every part of us, the metaphorical heart delivers life-giving motivation and
emotional energy and commitment to what we are and what we do. This is what we must give to
the Lord&#8212;our deepest commitments, our innermost desires&#8212;if we are not to be weary in
well-doing. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Speaking of the new and everlasting covenant of the gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul wrote to the
Hebrews, <i>&#8220;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,
saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts . . .&#8221;</i> (Hebrews
8:10).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I want you to look very carefully at the words in that verse. When we give our hearts to the Lord,
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">He</span> writes the covenants and the promises in our heart. Through the power of the Spirit, those
promises become our deepest commitments and the motivating force in our lives. When we
repent and come to Him in humility, seeking His forgiveness, we come to Him with hearts that
are broken. Through the ordinance of baptism, and through its renewal each week in the
sacrament, we express our willingness to take upon ourselves His name and we promise to keep
His commandments and always remember Him. The Lord changes our hearts through the power
of the Atonement and the ministry of the Holy Ghost. What was there before is changed through
His mercy and grace and power. This mighty change of heart comes as He writes the new
covenant and His new promises there. Our hearts become His, because He makes our hearts
anew. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />This process of giving your heart to the Lord is the great key to understanding the purpose of the
Honor Code and its place in your life. The Honor Code is a preparatory commitment to live the
gospel and conduct your lives in a spirit of obedience. It not only protects against evil and invites
the blessings of heaven here and now, but it will help you to prepare to live the higher law. In
that spirit of preparation, you not only need to live the letter, but also the spirit of the Honor
Code. You need to be in the Zone and on the Path of Discipleship. For that to happen, the Honor
Code needs to get into your heart. Don&#8217;t let it be just a set of rules written on paper or on the
Web that you have to live to be in good standing in this university. I pray that you may give your
heart to the Lord and see and feel the Honor Code as a blessing, as a source of strength and
protection and a preparatory gateway to the marvelous blessings of the new and everlasting
covenant that the Lord desires to give you. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In these higher covenants we promise all that we have or might have to the Lord and His work.
We promise all that we are or might become to our eternal companion. There is no room there
for a partial or halfhearted commitment. There is no place in these eternal covenants for living at
the edge of obedience. The Lord will have all of you, all of your heart, all of your might, all of
your mind, and all of your will. But His promise to you is likewise all encompassing: if you are
true and faithful to those covenants, you will be endowed with power from on high; you will be
joint heirs with Christ; you will receive all that the Father has. Can you understand it? Can you
begin to comprehend it? </font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and
stood over where the young child was.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his
mother, and fell down, and worshipped him . . . </i>(Matthew 2:9-11).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />The star that led the Wise Men to the Savior was real. But it also was symbolic of the light that
came into the world with the Savior&#8217;s birth. As I searched the scriptures to understand the star, I
found two wonderful passages. The first is Revelations 22:16: <i>&#8220;I Jesus have sent mine angel to
testify unto you these things . . . . I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and
morning star.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Savior is the Light of the World. He is the sure guide for each of us. His light is the guide
each one of us may have. I learned that in the second passage, found in 2 Peter 1:16, 19. Here is
Peter&#8217;s powerful testimony:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto
you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his
majesty.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day
star arise in your hearts.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I first read this scripture, I thought, &#8220;What a beautiful idea: the Savior arising in our
hearts.&#8221; And then I remembered a song I sang as a little girl. The song is called 
		<i>Star Bright</i>. The
chorus from the song goes like this: </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Oh, star bright&#8212;the world is pining</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For you to turn night into the day;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Oh, star bright&#8212;in Heaven shining</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Come glow within me </i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>On Christmas day.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">These are beautiful ideas, and I was grateful to find them. But I was not finished. One night
during the holidays I woke up with a thought running through my mind. I had been thinking
about the light of the Christmas star and about the day star arising in our hearts. The thought in
my mind when I woke up was this: &#8220;The day star, the bright and morning star, can only rise in
hearts that are pure.&#8221; This thought guided me to further reading, and I found another scripture
that teaches us that it is only with the Savior&#8217;s help that our hearts can be purified in order for
Him to dwell there. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust
of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and
apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and
our hearts may be purified . . . </i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord
came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of
their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which
they had in Jesus Christ who should come . . . </i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The people believed the words of King Benjamin who prophesied of the coming of Jesus Christ.
With faith they asked for mercy and the application of the atoning blood upon them that their
&#8220;hearts might be purified.&#8221; And the star arose in their hearts filling them with joy.</font></p>

</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I have contemplated what I should share with you today, a talk by Elder Bednar while he was
still President of the University came to mind. He suggested that Brigham Young University<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho was or would become a Disciple Preparation Center. President Clark, at graduation in
December, also spoke about being disciples and the responsibility that each of us has to spread
the light and knowledge that we have gained here at this great University throughout the world.
So what can I share with young women and young men who are on the path to discipleship? The
most basic and fundamental principle for a disciple to understand is &#8220;Faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ.&#8221; So I have decided to speak to you about first principle of the gospel (4<sup>th</sup> Article of
Faith). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We all know the definition of faith found in Alma chapter 32:21 which states, 
		<i>&#8220;Faith is not to
have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore, if ye have faith ye hope for thing which are not
seen, which are true.&#8221; </i>I have found myself in difficult situations and have thought how much
easier it would be if I could only see through the veil. I have since come to the conclusion that if
I could see, I would not have faith. Faith requires stepping out into the darkness and depending
on our Heavenly Father and Savior Jesus Christ for guidance.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">President Hinckley in his book Standing for Something tells of an experience he and his wife had
many years ago as they flew across the Pacific from Honolulu, Hawaii to Los Angeles. In those
days, they only had propeller-driven aircraft available. About halfway across the Pacific, one of
the motors stopped. There was a decrease in speed, a lowering in altitude, and a certain amount
of nervousness among all of the passengers on board. Much of the aircraft&#8217;s power was missing,
and the hazards were increased accordingly. Without the power, they could not fly high, fast, or
safely. What a welcome sight the Los Angeles airport was when they finally reached it. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Hinckley went on to say:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>It is so with our lives when we discount the need for faith and disregard
knowledge of the Lord. Under those conditions, we are, as it were, flying on
partial power. We simply cannot do as much alone as we can when we team our
efforts with the Divine. Passive acceptance or acknowledgment of God is not
enough. Vibrant testimony comes of anxious seeking </i>(pg. 110). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Elder Oaks has indicated just having faith is not enough; we must have faith centered upon Jesus
Christ. He states <i>&#8220;Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is a conviction and trust that God knows us and
loves us and will hear our prayers and answer them with what is best for us&#8221;</i> (Ensign, May
1994, 98). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the greatest examples of simple faith in the Lord Jesus Christ can be found in the bible.
There was a woman whose husband had died. Left alone to raise her son, she had tried to find
ways of supporting herself, but she lived in a time of terrible famine. Food was scarce and many
were perishing because of hunger. As available food diminished, so did the woman&#8217;s chance of
surviving. Every day, she watched helplessly as her meager supply of food decreased. Hoping
for relief, but finding none, the woman finally realized the day had come when she had only
enough food for one last meal. It was then that a stranger approached and asked the unthinkable.
		<i>&#8220;Bring me, I pray thee,&#8221; </i>he said to her, <i>&#8220;a morsel of bread.&#8221; 
		</i>The woman told the man that all
she had left was a little bit of oil and little bit of meal, just enough for one last cake. She was
about to prepare it as a last meal for herself and her son, <i>&#8220;that we may eat it, and die.&#8221; 
		</i>She did
not know that the man before her was the prophet, Elijah, sent to her by the Lord.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><i>&#8220;Fear not,&#8221; </i>he said to her, <i>&#8220;but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and
after make for thee and for thy son.&#8221; </i>Can you imagine what she must have thought? What she
must have felt? But then came the prophetic promise, <i>&#8220;For thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord
sendeth rain upon the earth.&#8221; </i><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The woman, after hearing this promise, went in faith and did as Elijah had directed. 
		<i>&#8220;And she,
and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the
cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah&#8221;
		</i>(1Kings 17:11-16.) </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So how can we develop such faith in the Lord Jesus Christ? Elder Hales has told us 
		<i>&#8220;faith is
acquired through prayer with a sincere desire to draw close to God and trust in Him to bear our
burdens and give us answers to life&#8217;s unexplained mysteries of the purpose of life&#8221; 
		</i>(Ensign, Nov.
2004, 70). Elder Oaks gives us two other requirements. These include studying the scriptures and
words of the prophets as well as having trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. He states, 
		<i>&#8220;We must trust
him enough that we are content to accept his will, knowing that he knows what is best for us&#8221;
		</i>(Ensign, May 1994, 98). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to suggest one more thing that has helped my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ to grow
and that is refining experiences that we are given in this life. Each time I have heard Sister Ann
Pingree, who is the second counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency speak, I am
touched by her unwavering faith. This past September she spoke in the General Relief Society
meeting for the women of the Church. She talked about the refining process in her life. She was
in her mid thirties and had four young children when she received her patriartical blessing. The
blessing the patriarch gave emphasized missionary work over and over again. She felt
overwhelmed with the thought of being a missionary. She had barely read the Book of Mormon
once herself and felt inadequate to teach others about the gospel. When her patriarchal blessing
came, she tucked it away carefully in a drawer. Over the years that followed, she and her
husband focused on preparing their children to serve missions. After sending her sons to many
lands on missions, she believed she had completed her missionary duty.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Then her husband was called to be the Mission President in Nigeria. With this calling came
many questions and concerns for her. She was worried about going over 10,000 miles away from
home, leaving both her married and unmarried children and her aging father and mother-in-law
behind. What would they eat while they were there? Would they be safe in a country that was
politically unstable and dangerous? She felt inadequate on every level. It is interesting to note
what she did to increase her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Her prayers became constant and fervent. She redoubled her efforts to attend the temple. She
searched the scriptures, fasted and prayed, and all the while tried to live faithful to the covenants
that she had made. The next thing she had to do was to step out into the darkness. In order to do
this, she realized that she needed to rely completely on the Lord and seek for personal revelation.
And finally, she had to submit her will to the Lord&#8217;s in order to receive His help, His guidance,
and His protection (Ensign, Nov 2005). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As I listened to her speak, I was reminded of an earlier talk that she had given. She and her
husband, while serving in Nigeria, had traveled to a remote location in their mission so he could
conduct temple recommend interviews with the members in that area. Some of these members
had been in the Church for less than two years. All of the members lived 3,000 miles away from
the nearest temple in Johannesburg, South Africa. None had received their temple endowment.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The members all knew the appointed day that President and Sister Pingree would come, but no
one knew the exact hour they would arrive. There was no way to call ahead since telephones
were rare in that part of West Africa. So these committed Saints gathered early in the morning to
wait all day, if necessary, for their temple recommend interviews. When the Pingree&#8217;s arrived,
they noticed two Relief Society sisters waiting among the rest of the group.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">After many hours, all of the temple recommend interviews were completed. The Pingree&#8217;s began
the drive back along the sandy jungle trail and were stunned when they saw these two sisters still
walking. They realized they had trekked from their village, a distance of 18 miles round trip, just
to obtain a temple recommend they knew they would never have the privilege of using.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">These Nigerian Sisters believed the counsel of President Howard W. Hunter who said, 
		<i>&#8220;It would
please the Lord for every adult member to be worthy of and to carry a current temple
recommend, even if proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or frequent use of it&#8221; 
		</i>(Feb,
1995, 5). Sister Pingree concluded, <i>&#8220;In her hand, carefully wrapped in a clean handkerchief,
each sister carried her precious temple recommend. I carry their examples of faith carefully
wrapped in my heart&#8221; </i>(Ensign, Nov. 2003, 13). These sisters truly exhibited faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ. Surely this experience and many others like it strengthened Sister Pingree&#8217;s faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we experience difficulties, trials, and challenges in this life, we must realize we are not alone.
Our loving Heavenly Father remains very near to help us and strengthen us as we move forward
in faith. In Section 24:8 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read: <i>&#8220;Be patient in afflictions, for
thou shalt have many; but endure them, for lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days.&#8221;
		</i>I
cannot think of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ without being reminded of my own pioneer
ancestors who exhibited faith in every footstep. I have ancestors that came in both the Martin
and Willie handcart companies. Many years after these companies came into the Salt Lake
Valley, there was a Sunday School class that brought up sharp criticism about the decision of the
Martin handcart Company to start for the Salt Lake Valley so late in the year. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">An elderly man arose and said:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing
about. Cold historic facts give no proper interpretation of the questions involved.
Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was
in that company and my wife, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine
and many died of exposure and starvation, but we became acquainted with God in
our extremities.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of
food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and
seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go that far and there I
must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it. I have gone on to that sand and
when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to
see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels
of God were there.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of
my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege
to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart
Company</i> (Liahona Feb. 1997, 15). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I have read this account many times over the years I have been struck by two things. First of
all, it was through the fires of affliction that these great pioneers came to know God. By the time
they reached the Salt Lake Valley, their testimonies and devotion to our Heavenly Father were
strengthened and their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ increased. They had learned what it means
to step out into the darkness and to be completely submissive to God&#8217;s will. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The second thing that has brought much comfort to me is the fact that they received strength and
help from angels that were unseen. I have sensed many times a loving Heavenly Father very near
as I have gone through difficulties, trials, and challenges. Although the difficulties I have been
through in my life cannot begin to compare with those of my pioneer ancestors, and my handcart
is very different than the ones they pulled, I too have received strength and help from angels
unseen as I have been pushed along from behind. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Elder Oaks spoke of trust as being one of the important things to help us develop faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ. He stated, <i>&#8220;Conviction that the Lord knows more than we do and that he will
answer our prayers in the way that is best for us and for all of his other children is a vital
ingredient&#8221; </i>(Ensign, May 1994, 98). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Elder John H. Groberg taught this in an experience he had while on his mission to Tonga. He
said they would always pray for protection, success, and good seas and wind that would take
them to their destination. Once he asked the Lord to bless them with a good tail wind so they
could get to their destination more quickly. An older man in the group told Elder Groberg that he
need to modify his prayer since by praying for a tail wind, he was actually praying against the
people who would be trying to come from the other direction. The older gentleman suggested
that he should just pray for a good wind, not a tail wind.<br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Groberg went on to conclude, </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Sometimes we pray for things that will benefit us, but may hurt others. We may
pray for a particular type of weather, or to preserve someone&#8217;s life, when that
answer to our prayer may hurt someone else. That&#8217;s why we must always pray in
faith, because we can&#8217;t have true, God-given faith in something that is not
according to His will.</i><br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Oaks taught<i> &#8220;faith, no matter how strong it is, cannot produce a result contrary to the will
of Him whose power it is. That is why we cannot have true faith in the Lord without also having
complete trust in the Lord&#8217;s will and in the Lord&#8217;s timing&#8221; 
		</i>(Ensign, May 1994, 98). We must
move forward then believing what Howard W. Hunter once said, <i>&#8220;God knows what we do not
know and he sees what we do not see&#8221; </i>(Ensign, Nov 1987, 60). </font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Oaks tells a story of a young woman who exercised that kind of faith and trust. For many
months, her mother had been seriously ill. Finally, the faithful father called the children to her
bedside and told them to say good-bye to their mother because she was dying. The twelve-year-old daughter protested: 
		<i>&#8220;Papa, I do not want my mamma to die. I have been with her in the
hospital for six months; time and time again you have administered to her, and she has been
relieved of her pain and quietly gone to sleep. I want you to lay hands upon my mamma and heal
her.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The father, who was Elder Heber J. Grant, told the children that he felt in his heart that their
mother&#8217;s time had arrived. The children left, and he knelt by his wife&#8217;s beside. Later he recalled
his prayer: <i>&#8220;I told the Lord I acknowledged his hand in life and in death. But I told the Lord that
I lacked the strength to have my wife die and to have it affect the faith of my little children&#8221; He
pleaded with the Lord to give his daughter &#8220;a knowledge that it was His mind and His will that
her mamma should die.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Within an hour the mother died. When Elder Grant called the children back into her room and
told them, his little six-year-old boy began to weep bitterly. The twelve-year-old sister took him
in her arms and said:<i> &#8220;Do not weep, Heber; since we went out of this room, the voice of the Lord
from heaven has said to me, &#8216;In the death of your mamma, the will of the Lord shall be done&#8217;&#8221;
		</i>(Bryant S. Hinckley, <i>Heber J. Grant: Highlights in the Life of a Great Leader</i>, Salt Lake City:
Desert Book Co., 1951, pp. 243-244). (Ensign, May 1994, 98). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Our Savior himself set the example for unwavering trust in our Heavenly Father in the garden of
Gethsemane. Joseph Smith&#8217;s translation of Luke 22:42 describes how he knelt down and prayed:
		<i>&#8220;Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not my will, but thine be
done&#8221; </i>(JST, Luke 22:42). <br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">What are the blessings that we can expect in our lives as we develop true faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ? The answer to this question may be somewhat up to each one of us. In Alma chapter
62:41 we are told that after a long war between the Nephites and the Lamanites
		<i>&#8220;many had
become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened
because of their affliction&#8221; </i>(Alma 62:41). Some of the blessings may be apparent in this life and
some may not be until the life to come. President Faust has said, <i>&#8220;We may not ever know why
some things happen in this life. The reason for some of our suffering is known only to the Lord&#8221;
		</i>(Ensign, Nov 2004). As those valiant Nigerian sisters stepped out into the darkness and walked
along that sandy jungle trail in West Africa, I am sure they could not have imagined that a

<p><font color="#000080">President Checketts alluded to some of the blessings we can receive from having faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ in a Stake Conference that I attended several months ago when he talked about
the refining and the resulting development of our testimonies. His talk reminded me of an
analogy I had once heard about a group of women who were involved in a Bible study on the
book of Malachi. As they were studying chapter three, they came across verse three which says:
		<i>&#8220;He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.&#8221; </i>This verse puzzled the women and they
wondered what this statement meant about the character and nature of God. One of the women
offered to find out about the process of refining silver and get back to the group at their next
Bible study. That week this woman called up a sliver smith and made an appointment to watch
him at work. She didn&#8217;t mention anything about the reason for her interest in silver beyond her
curiosity about the process of refining silver. As she watched the silver smith, he held a piece of
silver over the fire and let it heat up. He explained that in refining silver, one needed to hold the
silver in the middle of the fire where the flames were hottest to burn away all of the impurities.
The woman thought about God holding us in such a hot-spot, then she thought again about the
verse, that he sits as a refiner and purifier of silver. She asked the silver smith if it was true that
he had to sit there in front of the fire the whole time the silver was being refined. The answer
was &#8220;yes, he not only had to sit there holding the sliver, but he had to keep his eyes on the silver
the entire time it was in the fire. If the silver was left even a moment too long in the flames, it
would be destroyed.&#8221; The woman was silent for a moment. Then she asked the silver smith, how
do you know when the silver is fully refined? He smiled at her and answered, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s easy,
when I see my image in it.&#8221;</font></p>

the other souls. Before each of us laid our lives like the squares of a quilt in many
piles. An angel sat before each of us sewing our quilt squares together into a
tapestry that is our life. But as my angel took each piece of cloth off the pile, I
noticed how ragged and empty each of my squares were. They were filled with
giant holes. Each square was labeled with a part of my life that had been difficult,
the challenges and temptations I was faced with in everyday life. I saw hardships
that I endured, which were the largest holes of all. I glanced around me. Nobody
else had such squares. Other than a tiny hole here and there, the other tapestries
were filled with rich color and the bright hues of worldly fortune. I gazed upon
my own life and was disheartened. My angel was sewing the ragged pieces of
cloth together, threadbare and empty, like binding air.</i></font></p>

scrutiny of truth. The others rose, each in turn holding up their tapestries. So
filled their lives had been. My angel looked upon me, and nodded for me to rise.
My gaze dropped to the ground in shame. I hadn&#8217;t had all the earthly fortunes. I
had love in my life, and laughter. But there had also been trials of illness, and
death, and false accusations that took from me my world as I knew it. I had to
start over many times. I often struggled with the temptation to quit, only to
somehow muster the strength to pick up and begin again.</i></font></p>

offering it up to the Father in hopes that I would not melt within my skin beneath
the judgmental gaze of those who unfairly judged me. Now, I had to face the truth.
My life was what it was, and I had to accept it for what it was.</i></font></p>

the air. I gazed around at the others who stared at me with wide eyes. Then I
looked upon the tapestry before me. Light flooded the many holes, creating the
image, the face of Christ. Then our Lord stood before me with warmth and love in
His eyes. He said &#8220;every time you gave over your life to Me, it became My life,
My hardships and My struggles. Each point of light in your life is when you
stepped aside and let Me shine through, until there was more of Me than there
was of you. </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I bear testimony to you today that I have come to know that if we study the scriptures, pray and
trust in the Lord through times of trial and refining, our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will
increase. It is through these refining experiences that I have come to know that each of us has a
Heavenly Father who loves us. Not only does he know our name but he has a carefully laid out
plan for each of us including refining experiences to help us to grow and to learn as he molds us
into the people that he knows we have the potential to become. As we go through these refining
experiences he remains very near to help us, to strengthen us, to encourage us and to give us the
courage to continue on. I have sensed many times that when I am happy He rejoices with me and
I know that I have never wept alone.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I know that I have an elder brother Jesus Christ. He is my Savior and Redeemer. Without his
atoning sacrifice none of us would have any hope of every returning to live with our Heavenly
Father again. Next to his atoning sacrifice I am grateful for the perfect example that he has set
for me to follow. I will conclude with a personal experience that illustrates this concept.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">A year and a half ago our beautiful two-year old daughter passed away. Through the long night
before she died I sat at her bedside in the Intensive Care Unit at Primary Children&#8217;s Medical
Center in Salt Lake City ,Utah. As I held her hand, I prayed silently, but constantly that
Heavenly Father would spare her life and that she would be restored to health. Being a
Registered Nurse, I watched anxiously for any sign of improvement in her condition. As the
dawn came, signaling the beginning of a new day, so did the realization that not only was her
condition not improving, but it was deteriorating. The doctors gave us no hope. I, at that point,
had to contemplate what my life would be like without her. I could not imagine it. She was my
baby and she liked me. I couldn&#8217;t comprehend living the rest of my mortal existence without her
here with me. I began to silently plead with my Heavenly Father. I begged him not to make me
go through it. I told him it was too hard and I couldn&#8217;t do it. Somewhere in the midst of my
pleading, words came into my mind. They were the words of my Savior in the Garden of
Gethsemane where he suffered beyond anything that I, as a mortal, can comprehend. He pleaded
with our Heavenly Father to not make Him go through it. But then came His concluding words,
		<i>&#8220;Not my will, but Thine be done.&#8221; </i>With all of the courage, hope, trust, and faith I could muster, I
silently concluded, not my will, but Thine be done.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Within an hour as my husband and I rocked her, still connected to life support, she was gently
lifted from our arms and returned to our Heavenly Father. As we drove the 3 &#189; hours to home in
silence, there were many things that went through my mind. One that I shamefully admit
thinking, &#8220;Heavenly Father, I sure hope you know what you are doing.&#8221; because taking her had
left such a huge hole in our family and in our hearts. <br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we walked into our family room that day, all ten of our children were there along with our
two little grandchildren. Our returned missionary son was reading from the scriptures about
where Kaylie, our little daughter had gone. Our then, three-year old son ran up and hugged my
legs and then looked up at me and asked, &#8220;Mommy, how long are you going to be sad?&#8221; My
response was immediate and without thought. I told him that I was going to be sad forever
because at that moment, it truly seemed like I would be sad forever. But then I had to stop and
think. Really, how long would I be sad? I would be sad until I was with Kaylie again and if I
looked at it in eternal perspective, this life is but a moment. I would be sad, but a moment and
than I would be with Kaylie again. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We then sat down and talked as a family about why we were sad that day. We decided we were
sad because one of us was missing. We concluded that is how sad we would be in the next life if
one of us was missing because we did not make right choices in this life, only then, it truly
would be forever. We made a vow that day that we would try harder to live worthily to be with
our Heavenly Father and Kaylie again. If you were to come into our home today, you would
notice tucked in the corner of each of our temple pictures, a wallet size photo of Kaylie in her
little white dress taken just three weeks before she died. A constant reminder of the commitment
we made to each other to be together in the eternities. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">It is my prayer for each of us today that we may be as the Nephites and Lamanites who were
softened through their afflictions as our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is increased and we learn
to let his light shine through us.</font></p>

<font color="#000080"><br />Several factors slowed construction of the temple that we won&#8217;t take the time to discuss right
now. At the death of Brigham Young in 1877, the temple walls were about 40 feet high. Progress
on the temple continued steadily under the direction of Brigham Young&#8217;s successor, John
Taylor, but trouble with the US government over the issue of polygamy forced him into hiding
where he died in 1887. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />Strife between Federal and local officials lead Congress to enact several bills designed to break
the Mormons&#8217; political and economic power in the Utah Territory. Polygamy became the
emotional issue that garnered enough public support for congress to pass the Edmunds-Tucker
anti-polygamy Act. Among other things, the provisions of this act called for the imprisonment of
those convicted of cohabitation, the disenfranchisement of all women and of men who practiced
or even believed in polygamy, and the dissolution of all church businesses and the confiscation
of church properties. As a result of this act, thousands of Latter-day saints, including many
church leaders were imprisoned, while many others went into hiding. The Church also began to
experience significant debt as tithing receipts declined and business revenues dried up.</font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000080">In deciding whether or not to underwrite the art education of some young men in Paris, the First
Presidency had to weigh their desire to finish the temple in the finest possible manner against the
perilous financial circumstances facing the church in the wake of the Edmunds-Tucker Act.
Because of this act, church properties and businesses were being confiscated, tithing receipts
were down dramatically, and with the cost of legal fees and support for families of those in
prison, along with the continuing cost of the temple construction, demands on church resources
were great.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As they made preparations for their departure, Hafen, Pratt and Fairbanks attended a missionary
training session in Salt Lake City on June 4, 1890, and were afterwards set apart as missionaries
with a special purpose by Apostles Heber J. Grant and Anthon H. Lund and Seymore B. Young
of the Seventy.</font></p>

Journal).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to describe very briefly a little about each of the art missionaries and their family
situation at the time of their departure for Paris.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />Lorus Pratt was the son of apostle Orson Pratt. He served a mission in the eastern states, then
went to England to assist his father in organizing the Book of Mormon into chapters and verses
and providing cross references. Pratt had worked for some years as a portrait artist and as an
English teacher at the church&#8217;s University of Deseret (which later became the University of
Utah) He was age thirty four when he left for Paris, leaving his wife of ten years, Harriet Alzina
(Zina) Wheeler Pratt, age 31, who was six months pregnant, and their four children ages six to
one. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thirty-four-year-old John Fairbanks left his wife, Lillie Huish Fairbanks, age 33, the day before
their thirteenth wedding anniversary. They had eight children between the ages of twelve and
one. As a married man John had served a mission in the Southern States. Sometime after his
return to Payson, Utah he became good friends with John Hafen who introduced him to art.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At the time of his departure for Paris, Evans was 30 years old. He had been married ten years to
Catherine Lewis Evans, and they had six children between ages nine and one.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Herman Hugo Haag was born in Stuttgart, Germany, but immigrated to Utah at age 11 after his
family joined the Church. Living in Payson, Herman was acquainted with John Fairbanks, and
had also received art instruction from John Hafen. When Utah artist J. T. Harwood returned from
Paris to earn money for further study, Haag took lessons from him. Harwood encouraged Haag
to study in Paris too, so he joined the art missionaries a year later, at first under private support,
but he too began to receive church sponsorship, and is considered one of the Paris Art
missionaries, even though he did not participate in painting the temple murals. Because he stayed
in Paris a year after the others returned. When Haag returned from Paris at age 21, he became an
art instructor at the Church&#8217;s University of Deseret until his untimely death at age 24.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />This map shows the route the art missionaries took on their way to and from school every day,
which was about a three-mile walk that took about an hour. Note some of the sights they saw on
their way to and from school every day: Luxembourg gardens, Sorbonne university, Pantheon,
Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville, and the great Louvre art museum. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The art missionaries were impressed with the beauty of the city of Paris, with its great cultural
and historical monuments, and with how art seemed to permeate both the city and its citizens.
Fairbanks wrote to his wife:<i> &#8220;Paris is art on every side.&#8221; </i>Haag wrote to his younger sister
Louise, <i>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any other city which loves the beautiful and admires art more than
Paris does.&#8221; </i>To his artist friend in Utah, Evans wrote: <i>&#8220;The public gardens are filled with
sculpture, and in the public buildings also, in every design of architecture, sculpture has its
share. Everybody takes a great interest in art. The air is full of it, and show windows are lined
with it.&#8221; </i>And in his journal <i>Memoirs en France</i>, Hafen recorded:

<font color="#000080"><i>There is much to learn in my profession and much to see and observe in such a
great city where the accumulated treasures of ages are stored and where some of
the most important events of the world&#8217;s history have transpired. Coming out into
the world and beholding the great accomplishments of genius has greatly
intensified my ambition to become something more than a mere sojourner
through this probation.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There were two main art institutions for aspiring artists to attend in Paris. One, called the Ecole
de Beaux Arts, was the most prestigious. It was completely funded by the state of France, and
offered free tuition to students under 30 who could pass its rigorous entrance exam. The second
option was for students to attend one of the many private art schools, of which the Acad&eacute;mie
Julian was considered the best, and ranked near the Ecole in quality and prestige. In fact, several
prominent artists taught at both schools. It was at this institution that the art missionaries
enrolled. The Acad&eacute;mie Julian was so popular, attracting so many students from France and
around the world, that in 1890 it had opened separate studios in locations all around Paris, five
for men and three for women.</font></p>

drawings and paintings; they are very fine. These are framed in very common
frames or hung without frames. There are all manner of caricatures of those who
have attended school, some of which are very funny, some angular, and some
ridiculous. &#8230;the walls of the school rooms are nicely deckorated with the

from John B Fairbanks to Lillie Fairbanks, 12 October, 1890).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Can you imagine what it was like for these backwoodsmen from the Utah Territory with little
education and no formal training in art to enroll at one of the best art academies in the world?
The Utah artists were far less experienced than most of their classmates. Describing the
composition of the students in their atelier, Evans wrote:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>The most of the students at this school, which is heavily attended by Americans,
have all had some years of experience in art, and the majority have attended the
schools of New York, others the Munich schools of Germany. I think I am the only
one who has not had more or less experience in painting before entering this
school. All of our Utah boys have had less training than the others, and yet they
are doing fairly well compared with those who have spent from two to six years
here</i> (Evans to Weggland, Deseret Semi-Weekly News, December 26, 1890).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">These drawings demonstrate the significant development the Utah artists made in Paris. The
Julian had monthly drawing competitions called concours in which the students competed
against each other for prizes and recognition. All but one of the Utah artists had drawings
accepted in the competition and some of them won prizes. The two figure drawings are by Edwin
Evans. This landscape sketch by Hafen demonstrates the extracurricular work the artists did
during excursions to the countryside.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">During their time in Paris, the art missionaries joined a newly formed American students
association. The club provided a library containing current newspapers and periodicals, and
offered opportunities for the artists to display their work and to socialize. This picture, taken at
the club in about May 1891, includes all of the Utah artists who were studying in Paris at the
time: John Hafen, Edwin Evans, John Fairbanks, Herman Haag, Lorus Pratt, and John Clawson.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The approach the art missionaries took in their art studies is one that we as members of the
church have received by divine mandate. That is to<i> &#8220;seek learning, even by study and also by
faith&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:118). While I am not sure I understand the full implications
of this command, the art missionaries&#8217; experience suggests a part of what it means. In a letter to
his wife Thora, Hafen understood that one aspect of learning by faith was to live so as to be
worthy of help from the Holy Spirit.</font></p>

allotted for me to stay here. &#8230; God&#8217;s servants have blessed me with power to
accomplish my mission and get all the knowledge of art required. And I know God
is able to help me to so live that I will realize those blessings. My faith in the Lord

studied one or two years before coming here. &#8230;but I do not take the praise to
myself but give it to God</i> (Letter from John Fairbanks to Lillie Fairbanks, 30
December, 1890).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Hafen recognized that before we can expect God&#8217;s help to accomplish a task which is beyond
our natural capacity, God expects us first to use every talent he has already given us,
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;the
work before me is so great that I must use all the strength and ability I have in accomplishing it,
before I can reasonably expect special divine aid&#8221; </i>(Letter from John Hafen to Thora Hafen 31
August, 1890).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">While studying in Paris, John Fairbanks came to realize that he was not born with as much
natural artistic ability as most of his classmates. But he also learned a truth that it would be well
for all of us to note&#8212;that the person who works hard to use what natural ability he possesses,
and depends on the Lord to make up for his or her deficiencies will likely be more successful
than those who depend on talent alone:</font></p>

<font color="#000080"><i>I discover Lillie that it is hard solid work that is going to make the Artist rather
than talent. The man who has the ambition to work whether he has much talent or
not is likely to get there, while the man who has talent never will get there without
work. I have therefore concluded to depend upon work and the help of the Lord. I
work all day and at night. &#8230;But to me there is pleasure in the work&#8212;I love it, I
feel happy while doing it</i> (Letter from John Fairbanks to Lillie Fairbanks 25

Church members from around the world. What do you suppose those faithful members and the
leaders of the church expect of you in return? I think it is the same as they expected from the art
missionaries, as expressed in a letter to them by President George Q. Cannon. I would like you to

Gospel. In gaining a collegiate education they have lost their faith. It is a bad
exchange. They lose with their faith all interest in the work of God, and some of

the same truths they did about a real dilemma we all face at some point in our lives.

of 1892, John Hafen, Lorus Pratt, John Fairbanks, and Edwin Evans had all returned home to
Utah. Between January and March of 1893, they collaborated in painting rooms in the Salt Lake
Temple representing the Garden of Eden and the Lone and dreary world into which Adam and
Eve were cast, aiding countless worshippers in understanding their purpose and eternal potential.

<p style="text-indent: 0.25in"><font color="#000080">None of the art missionaries achieved great fame or fortune during their lifetime. They
struggled their whole lives to support their families through art. Most became teachers at various
educational institutions who inspired the next generation of Utah and LDS artists. They created
works of beauty and peace that reveal the majesty of God as reflected in nature. And their art
still serves today as an example of the results of learning by study and by faith.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">As we have concluded the year 2005, I have marveled at the response of the members of the
Church to heed the voice of the prophet as he challenged each of us to read the Book of Mormon
by the end of the year. Remarkable stories are coming in from all over the world of a renewal of
interest in this great book and testimony after testimony of the truthfulness of the doctrines
contained therein. The evidence is so profoundly clear that if we heed the words of our leaders,
wonderful things happen in our lives. Great lessons are to be learned from this experience. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I completed reading the Book of Mormon just before Thanksgiving. Then I started over again. I
find that each time I immerse myself in reading this witness of our Lord and Savior, the
doctrines of the kingdom increase in clarity, thus my understanding increases. I have also made a
remarkable discovery. When I make a plan to accomplish a reading assignment by a certain
period of time, I am much more faithful in seeing that I stay on the schedule. Since starting over
the second time, I am struggling to develop a more consistent pattern of again reading the Book
of Mormon. I must conclude we are more successful in our efforts if we set goals in what we
desire to accomplish.</font></p>

that.&#8221; </i>The phrase <i>&#8220;and it came to pass&#8221; </i>appeared in 1<sup>st</sup> Nephi chapter 1, verse 4, right at the

the plan, they will be blessed. When they turn away from it, they will find themselves suffering

<p><font color="#000080">This glorious plan included the Lord&#8217;s mortal experience, when He came to Earth to atone for
the sins of all mankind. After the death of the Savior, His apostles went forth throughout many

Christian movement. The travel of those early leaders was hard and difficult. Journeys were long
and tiresome. Paul traveled extensively by ship, to preach and teach the gospel.</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Without direction from a central church leadership, the Christian teachings soon became mixed
and polluted with pagan beliefs. As had been predicted, the Church fell into a general apostasy.<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Two essential ingredients were missing during this period of apostasy. First, the holy priesthood,
through which the Lord would reveal His will through those chosen to carry on His great work,
was lost. The second was the lack of the scriptures being available to the people in order that
they could gain an understanding of the doctrines of the Kingdom. The teaching was left to a few
priests who possessed the biblical writings and guarded them jealously. Keeping them from the
common people was a means of exercising power over them. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Just as Paul and other prophets had declared there would be a falling away before a glorious
restoration would occur. The reestablishment of the gospel of Jesus Christ on the Earth in the last
days with all of its powers, ordinances, doctrines, offices and all things as they had existed in
former ages would also occur. The book of Acts describes it as a restoration of all things. 
		</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which
God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
</i>(Acts 3:20-21). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To begin the preparation for the restitution of all things, it was necessary to have the scriptures
available for the people. Johann Gutenberg was inspired to invent a multiple-type press making
it possible to print larger volumes of material. The first product of his press was the Holy Bible.
It required seven to eight years to print the first copy. Now the printed word started to be
available to mankind.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord, knowing full well that the restoration would take place in an English-speaking
country, inspired men such as William Tyndale, an Oxford scholar trained in Latin, Hebrew and
Greek, to see the need to make an English translation of the Bible. Tyndale&#8217;s translation came
directly from the Hebrew and Greek texts. When opposition to his work became too extreme in
England, he fled to Germany. There he produced bibles and literally smuggled them back to
England into the peoples&#8217; hands. What was the result of his great contribution? He was
imprisoned, suffering mentally and physically for eighteen months until he was taken from his
cell, tied to a stake, strangled and then burned. His final words were &#8220;Lord, open the King of
England&#8217;s eyes.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A breakthrough had occurred. Slowly, the scriptures were now reaching the common people.
With the people having their minds largely expanded in a knowledge of the holy scriptures, a
great reformation was occurring to correct the problems that had crept into the Church during the
period of the apostasy. The Lord, in His divine plan, was preparing the world with conditions
which would make it possible for the restoration of the gospel. This time it would be permanent
and would endure even to the end. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And it came to pass on the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of December 1805, a prophet was born, by the name of
Joseph Smith, who would be the instrument in the Lord&#8217;s hands to bring forth this glorious
restoration.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">With the birth of the Prophet, it was just as if the Lord illuminated the minds of mankind to make
it possible that technology and communications would be such that the gospel could be spread
throughout the earth. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Beginning with the 1800&#8217;s, the Lord was inspiring the minds of mankind to create new ways to
manufacture paper. The invention of the cylinder press made it possible for the printed word to
be available. The discovery of electricity exploded the minds of men to make it possible to
communicate by telephones, radios, TVs, computers, internet, satellites, etc. The steam, internal
combustion and jet engines made travel convenient for men to travel to all corners of the earth.
The world was being readied for the restoration of the gospel.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">President Spencer W. Kimball said in the film, &#8220;Go Ye Into All The World,&#8221; produced in 1977,
		<i>&#8220;the Lord will place in our hands inventions which will almost be impossible for us to
comprehend and who can say what other miracles the Lord has prepared for us.&#8221; 
		</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are flooded with ways to communicate and teach the gospel of our Lord and Savior. Today,
it was reported to me that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wall Street Journal</span> reported some facts on how rapidly technology
is advancing. The ability to do computations doubles every eighteen months, storage memory
devices double every twelve months, and communication doubles every nine months.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">And it came to pass, starting in the 1830&#8217;s, that the Lord opened the heavens and restored the
fullness of the gospel by establishing the Church of Jesus Christ again on the Earth. His hand is
in all things, His work is well planned and is directed to bring about the restoration of all things
in this great era in which we live. The Church and technology have progressed to the point where
worldwide expansion can continue to take place. It is now possible to communicate with every
stake president in the Church through the internet. The satellite is connected to almost every
stake center throughout the world. We can see that there is no limit to the progress we should be
making in spreading the gospel to all the world. The Lord in His divine plan has made it possible
for this work to go forward. It will come to pass that it will continue to expand and reach all
corners of the Earth before He declares the time of the end of man&#8217;s mortal experience on the
Earth.<br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">We know what can occur through following that plan and living righteous lives, for then we will
receive the blessings of heaven. If we turn from them, the scriptures are abundantly clear on
what will happen. Only misery and heartache can await as the result of their transgressions.<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Savior once said, <i>&#8220;If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are
not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you&#8221;
		</i>(John
15:19). From the teachings of the Savior, we have adopted the saying in the Church to be &#8220;in the
world,&#8221; but not &#8220;of the world.&#8221; The phrase has two distinct parts, the first being &#8220;in&#8221; and the
second &#8220;not of.&#8221; Too often, I think we use them together and think of them as justification to
remain somewhat detached, somewhat removed from the world. I would like to separate this
phrase today and give emphasis only on the part being in the world. <br /></font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is far better to view the two parts separately as equally important admonitions. Of course, we
must stay free from the sins of materialism in the world around us. But it is equally important
that we live in the world. It is in the world that we have the privilege of coming to our mortal
experience. It is in the world that we are to be tested and tried. It is in the world that we have the
opportunity to partake of the sacred saving ordinances which will measurably determine our
post-mortal life. It is in the world that we must be saved. It is in the world that Christ must come
again. We will play no part in saving the world in preparing for its destiny or in making it a
better place to live if we refuse to take part and make our contribution to it while we so live here.
Prophets in this day have encouraged us to be mindful of our obligation while we are here in the
world. I would like to quote from just two of them. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">First from President Heber J. Grant: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>What a wonderful power we shall have with the Lord in furthering His mighty
purpose on earth if we keep His commandments. Our influence will be not only
with the world but with those we serve. Their strength and their power will be
multiplied if we shall succeed in having them feel the necessity of observing the
commandments of the Lord, particularly the Word of Wisdom and the principles
of clean and righteous life. </i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And it is not out of place to predict that the people of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints will continue to thrive and prosper, spiritually and
temporally, as long as they keep the commandments of God and walk in the way
which he shall point out through his inspired servants holding the holy
Priesthood. They are a people whose faith, teachings, thrift, and temporal and
spiritual progress will be a blessing and an advantage to the whole nation</i>
(Gospel Standards, Improvement Era, 1942, p. 101).<br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">From President David O. McKay, who said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>The responsibility of showing to the world that the gospel of Jesus Christ will
solve its problems rests upon the men who make the claim, who believe that every
world problem may be solved by obedience to the principles of the gospel of Jesus
Christ. The solution to the world&#8217;s greatest problems are here in the Church of
Jesus Christ. Ample provision is made not only for the needs of individuals but
also for the nations and groups of nations. I grant that we may seem to be
arrogating to ourselves superior wisdom, but we are not. It is simply the
application of God&#8217;s plan to the world problems. You who hold the priesthood
have greater responsibility today, now that you live in this creative moment in the
world's history, than ever the Church has had before. I repeat it. If we make the
claim to hold the truth, it is obligatory upon every Latter-day Saint so to live, that
when the people of the world come, in answer to the call, to test the fruit of the
tree, they will find it wholesome and good.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>The Lord help us to be able to prove to the world that we possess just what the
world today is longing for, and when they see it, may they know, as you know, as I
know, that the everlasting gospel is a light to the world </i>(Improvement Era, 1953,
p. 5).<br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I stand before a group today that is having one of the greatest opportunities ever given to the
children of men. You have been allowed to come to Earth when there is more truth in existence
than during any other generation in the history of time. Think of the sacrifice of the parent, the
widow, the worker, and the Church in making a great investment in you, providing you with the
facilities and instructors to give you a good education. What kind of return are they to receive on
this investment?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Is it an investment in time just for fun and games? Or do you show a real appreciation for the
sacrifice that is being made for you to take advantage of this opportunity to grow in knowledge.
You will probably never have a better opportunity to expose your minds to a variety of truth than
you will during these next years as you pursue your education. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">What will you do with this parade of information? Will it really become a part of you or is it just
a process of cramming in a session before an examination to get a passing grade. Are you
building a reserve of knowledge needed for your total life experience? Have you developed a
storage system to retain in an orderly fashion the information that will be of value to you in your
exciting life ahead? If not, your education will benefit you only in a small measure in
relationship to the great potential available for you here in this special time of your life. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There is a real need in the world for individuals who have the determination to stretch their
minds, to be of service in bringing about solutions to the many problems that face the world.
Learn to take advantage of the opportunities you are given to grow in knowledge and
understanding and be prepared mentally to serve in this vastly changing world that is just out
there before you. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">So we begin another year. The pages of history of 2006 are white and unrecorded before us.
What will history record of this new year concerning your contribution to mankind? Will the
pages of history almost completely omit your name and the fact that you were in the world
because you failed to make a contribution to your fellow man this year? Will there arise from
this body those who are prepared physically, who understand the Lord&#8217;s law of health, who have
prepared themselves well so that they will be an example to all they come in contact with? Or
will we prepare mentally? Will we be noticed for our contributions, in the way we study, the
knowledge we acquire, the wisdom that is ours? Emotionally are we prepared to serve, to give
ourselves to others, to help lift a soul, to touch a life, to increase the happiness of another one of
our Father in Heaven&#8217;s children? Spiritually, will we be so strong in our faith, that we will be
noticed because of that strength? Will we demonstrate by the life that we live that we believe in
Him and follow His laws? Will we be prepared for service in the Church and in the world?</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Barbara and I had the privilege of spending last year in the Europe Central Area of the Church.
We were pleased to see the great vitality and energy of the young single adults when church
service opportunities were made available to them. How rapidly they brought in new converts,
activated the inactive and, most pleasing, we were able to see temple marriages occurring. This
was being accomplished in spite of the trends in Europe to the contrary. <br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">We witnessed the de-Christianization of Europe. Europe is beginning the 21<sup>st</sup> century in a new
and uncharted phase of history. People of these great nations are embracing secularization. Most
secularized value systems reason that the human being has total autonomy. An individual does
not have to give an accounting to anything or anyone except himself and, to a certain extent, to
the society in which he lives. Secularization becomes a force for bringing about false ideas and
the breaking down of old traditions that have held civilizations together. <br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">This secular lifestyle has a spiritual and moral price. It has brought with it a curse of extreme
worldliness and selfishness, the decline of public and private morality, and the defiance of
authority, favoring individual freedom over responsibility to society, community and the world.
Another result is a declining birthrate to below replacement levels. Filling the gap of these
reduced numbers will be those of strong non-Christian faiths. It is forecast that the native
German population will drop from 85 million to 25 million by the turn of the next century. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">My concern is that we are following the same pattern towards secularization. We have embraced
and committed ourselves to the gospel of Jesus Christ which is completely contrary to Satan&#8217;s
plan. He is doing all he can to destroy families. Throughout your life, you must set an example to
safeguard the principles and doctrines which will bring the blessings of the Lord. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">And it came to pass that we have been blessed with the revealed doctrines from heaven, given to
us through holy prophets, which bring to mankind the promise of joy in this life and eternal
happiness in the eternities ahead. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thus we see that being obedient to the will of the Lord brings the blessings of heaven. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thus we see that disobedience to the will of the Lord literally brings the destruction of the
people. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A number of years ago I lived 
		in the Fiji Islands in the South Pacific. At the time I was serving in 
		the district presidency with President Semitie Langa Qulotuto. Annually 
		the Fijian Saints prepared for a temple visit to New Zealand: it being 
		the closest temple to Fiji at the time. As you can imagine this was a 
		great expense to the Saints.&nbsp; The members would have to save years and 
		years to have enough money to take their family across the sea to New 
		Zealand to receive their temple blessings.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This particular year a family 
		by the name of Tomassi Ringamoto made the decision to go to the temple.&nbsp; 
		They realized that they would never be able to go to the temple in New 
		Zealand on their present income. The only way that they could go was for 
		Brother Ridamoto to take a early retirement from his work and thereby 
		applying his retirement pension to the temple excursion. The Ridamotos 
		fasted and prayed and made such a decision.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I remember counseling with 
		the district president, about Tomassis decision and the necessity of 
		providing for a family.&nbsp; President Langa opened his scriptures and he 
		read from Proverbs 3:5-6 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and 
		lead not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him 
		and he shall direct thy paths.&nbsp; President Langa reminded me the Lord 
		had directed the path of Brother Ringamoto and that I shouldnt 
		interfere and he reminded me of the great trust the Polynesian had in 
		their Lord Jesus Christ. I have to admit that I was embarrassed for my 
		shortsightness</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The temple excursion was 
		marvelous. I can remember the Ringamoto family dressed in white as they 
		prepared to have their children sealed to them.&nbsp; It was truly a joyful 
		occasion.&nbsp; But in the back of my mind I had the thought When they 
		return home, there will be no employment to provide for his family. 
		Jobs of any kind were very scarce, but the faith of the Ringamotos was 
		an example to us all. There perseverance over the next several months 
		was inspiring. A job finally did open up. Not as good as his previous 
		employment but it was enough to provide for his family. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 2004 I returned to Fiji.&nbsp; 
		Since the time I had lived there, the Fijian Saints were blessed with 
		their very own temple. I visited the temple. The greeter at the temple 
		that day was the First Counselor in the temple Presidency Tomas 
		Ringamoto. It was a grand reunion after twenty-one years. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I was reminded of the 
		scripture in Ether Dispute not because ye see not, for you receive no 
		witness until after the trial of your faith. The Ringamotos wanted 
		their temple blessings and were willing to make sacrifices. However the 
		Lords comprehended the end from the beginning. What the Lord needed was 
		a future temple presidency. I learned a great lesson about trusting in 
		the Lord that day.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We need but to turn to the 
		account found in First Kings to appreciate this principle of the gospel 
		of which I have chosen to speak with you about today, that is, Trust in 
		the Lord with all your heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In First Kings we read that a 
		most severe drought had gripped the land, famine followed. This famine 
		had been designed to bring the children of Israel in the Northern 
		Kingdom to repentance. Elijah the prophet had been called to prophecy 
		amongst them. Elijah was destitute. He was without food or water. Elijah 
		received from the Lord what to him must have been an amazing 
		instruction.&nbsp; Get thee to Zarephath behold, I have commanded a widow 
		woman there to sustain thee (I Kings 16).&nbsp; Now think about that for a 
		moment. Of all the people the Lord could have directed to supply the 
		needs of substance, He chose a widow with a dependent. The widow would 
		have been the last one who would have had the means to do so.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The scripture account goes on 
		When he had found the widow, Elijah declared fetch me, I pray thee, a 
		little water in a vessel that I might drink.&nbsp; And as she was going 
		fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of 
		bread in thine hand.&nbsp; Her response described her desperate situation as 
		she explained she was preparing a final and scanty meal for her son and 
		for herself and then they would die.&nbsp; How implausible to her must have 
		been Elijahs response. Fear not, but go and do as thou hast said, but 
		make me therefore a little cake first, and bring it unto me; and after 
		make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel the 
		barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until 
		the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.&nbsp; And she went, and 
		did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did 
		eat many days.&nbsp; And the barrel of meal wasted not. Neither did the cruse 
		of oil fail (I Kings 16) Elijah trusted in the Lords way to resolve .</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">May I suggest to you three 
		reasons why we can trust the Lord to direct our paths.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Number one, He has all 
		knowledge. He knows all things; He is omniscient.&nbsp; We read in 1<sup>st</sup> 
		Nephi 9:6 where Nephi is told to make another sets of plates.&nbsp; We know 
		them as the small plates, which will bring about a parallel history of 
		Lehi and Nephis dealings.&nbsp; It reads:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">But 
		the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth 
		a way to accomplish all his works among the children of man; for behold, 
		he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words, and thus it is 
		Amen.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I would want to put my trust 
		in a God who knows all things, and can see all things past, present and 
		future. All things are before Him. His ways are not my ways, neither His 
		thoughts are my thoughts (Isaiah 55:8-9). Therefore He knows whats best 
		for each of us. What I need to do is put my trust in the Lord, learn His 
		will for me and then to stay the course.&nbsp; We learn from the Lectures on 
		Faith that without the knowledge of all things, God could not be able to 
		save any portion of his children.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Number two. He has all power, 
		might and authority.&nbsp; King Benjamin in his great address in Mosiah 
		chapter 4 verse 9 reads:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Believe in God, believe that he is and that he created all things both 
		in heaven and in earth, believe that he is all wisdom, all power both in 
		heaven and earth.&nbsp; Believe that man doth not comprehend all the things 
		which the Lord can comprehend. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Number three, God is the same 
		yesterday, today and forever, there is no variableness in Him. We read 
		from the Doctrine and Covenants section 3 verse 2:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">For 
		God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right 
		hand nor to the left; neither doth he vary to that which he hath said.&nbsp; 
		Therefore his paths are straight and his course is one eternal round.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Because of these three 
		attributes of God we can have confidence in the directions in which God 
		will give us as we receive revelation about our lives. May I illustrate 
		this truth with a personal experience.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A number of years ago, as a 
		college student at Weber State College up in Ogden Utah, I had a 
		singular experience that strengthen my trust in the Lord. During my 
		schooling I met Jana my future wife. After a time of dating and 
		courtship we married. We were happy, and our first child was on the way. 
		Like many college students funds were scarce: we had very little money. 
		We were excited about starting our family. We had done all we could to 
		prepare for the birth, however given the times we could not afford 
		health insurance. We had saved the necessary money to cover the cost of 
		the birth, and then trusted in the Lord that all would go well.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">On November 18<sup>th </sup>
		our first Child was born. We were excited and happy, he had come two 
		weeks early, but nonetheless all appeared just fine. We named him Dallan.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Two days after Dallans 
		birth, we realized not all was well. There was a blockage in his 
		intestines; this was life threatening. To receive the necessary care and 
		surgery, Dallan was sent to Primary Childrens Hospital in Salt Lake 
		City. There it was assessed that he would need surgery.&nbsp; Not only that, 
		we were told there were other complications as well. I remembered as the 
		doctor laid out the necessity schedule for surgery I asked At would 
		expense would this cost? He said not to worry about that at this time, 
		our babys life was the most important.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The surgery was successful, 
		and our little infant son was soon home with us after several weeks. 
		Shortly there after the bills began to arrive and they began to mount up 
		into the thousands upon thousands of dollars.&nbsp; We didnt know how we 
		were going to pay them. &nbsp;We were students. I remember actually raising 
		my clenched fist to Heaven saying, Why is it Lord that thou would hedge 
		up our way. The only solution that I could see was to drop out of 
		school and go to work full time in order to meet our obligations. We 
		prayed we fasted and in the mist of this despair and discouragement the 
		revelation came. The Lord helps them who help themselves. Trust in the 
		Lord with all thine heart.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;I met with Primary 
		Childrens Hospital and they told me of an organization called 
		Handicapped Children of Utah. I met with them and asked for financial 
		help. Unfortunately, since it was late in the year, all their money had 
		been committed to other individuals who deserving. As I began to leave 
		the receptionist said Why dont I take your application, just so that 
		we might have it on file. I met with many other organizations and 
		institutions which proved to be dead ends. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Two weeks later I received a 
		phone call from the Handicapped Children of Utah. They informed us that 
		one of their recipients had passed away and had left some money that 
		might be available to us. They asked me to bring our bills in that they 
		might look over those. We brought them in and the money that was 
		available was able to cover all of our bills. I was greatly humbled by 
		this. I was thankful. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I promised the Lord that I 
		would do all I could to serve Him. I stayed in school and kept my 
		promise and became a religious educator and have been so for 28 years 
		but I still feel that I am in the Lords debt. I testify I wouldnt be 
		here, standing before you today had I not trusted in the Lord. To trust 
		in the Lord is to rely on the Lords ways of doing things rather than 
		worlds way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The prophet Jacob declared 
		that No man knoweth of [the Lords] ways save it be revealed unto him.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In directing how the Saints 
		should provide for the poor, the Lord cautioned: &quot;It must needs be done 
		in mine own way.&quot; (</font><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://gospelink.com/library/goto-scrip?ref=dc/104/16">D&amp;C

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In the Kirtland period the 
		prophet Joseph Smith was commanded to build a temple. The Lord declared 
		that it should not be built &quot;after the manner of the world, for I give 
		not unto you that ye shall live after the manner of the world.&quot; (</font><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://gospelink.com/library/goto-scrip?ref=dc/95/13">D&amp;C

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Ezra Taft Benson 
		gave a useful explanation of the contrast between the Lord's way and the 
		world's way: &quot;The world works from the outside in. The world would take 
		people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then 
		they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by 
		changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their 
		environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change 
		human nature.&quot;</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1" color="#000080">1</font></span></span></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The way of the Lord is to call upon the weak 
		things of the world to subdue the world. &quot;Wherefore, I call upon the 
		weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to 
		thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit.&quot; (</font><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://gospelink.com/library/goto-scrip?ref=dc/35/13">D&amp;C 
		35:13</a><font color="#000080">.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A scriptural commentary has 
		noted, &quot;The Lord prefers prophets to scholars, meekness to wealth, and 
		simplicity to the magnificence and splendor of the world. Christ was 
		born in a stable, not a Roman palace.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1" color="#000080">2</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It is not be the way of the 
		world, to have a 95 year old man, Gordon B. Hinckkley, lead an 
		organization numbering 12 million. But in the Lords way, through 
		revelation and apostolic succession, He has chosen his own spokesmen and 
		designated his own methods to further his work.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We can not learn the ways of 
		the Lord without revelation. Elder Dallin H. Oaks has given us seven 
		requirements for receiving revelation. These requirements are unique to 
		the Lords way of learning by revelation. They have no counterparts in 
		the worlds ways of learning. They are: 1. Faith which is the first 
		principle of the gospel.&nbsp; 2. Humility. To be taught by the Holy Ghost a 
		person must be humble.&nbsp; 3. Prayer. Seven days without prayer makes one 
		weak. Prayer has a very short self-life. It is how we communicate with 
		God. 4. Keeping the commandments. This leads to righteousness which 
		leads to revelation.&nbsp; 5 and 6. Repentance and good works. He the 
		repenteth brings about good works. and 7. regular reading of the 
		scriptures. Scripture study brings the Spirit into our lives.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1" color="#000080">3</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Savior affirmed the 
		importance of learning by revelation and described how this occurs. He 
		asked his disciples, &quot;Whom say ye that I am?&quot; Simon Peter answered, 
		&quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; Jesus responded, 
		&quot;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed 
		it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.&quot; (</font><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://gospelink.com/library/goto-scrip?ref=Matt/16/15">Matt. 
		16:15-17</a><font color="#000080">.) In the acquisition of sacred 
		knowledge, in this case to know that Jesus is the Christ, reason must 
		yield to revelation. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This principle was taught in 
		the 6<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp; It involves 
		Oliver and Joseph Smith. &nbsp;Its April of 1829 Oliver Cowdery has just 
		come down to Harmony, Pennsylvania, he felt that he had an important 
		mission to help Joseph Smith scribe the translation of the Book of 
		Mormon.&nbsp; Joseph Smith accepted Oliver Cowdery to be his scribe: he felt 
		that the Lord had prepared him for the service.&nbsp; After they had been 
		translating for several days, Oliver felt overwhelmed with the 
		translation process. Oliver wanted a second witness about the 
		truthfulness of the work and the translation. He had lost confidence of 
		his first witness, therefore he was asking for a second witness.&nbsp; We 
		begin reading in the 20<sup>th</sup> verse of section 6. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">
		Verily, verily I say unto you if you desire a further witness cast you 
		mind upon the night that ye cried unto me in your heart, that ye might 
		know concerning the truth of these things.&nbsp; Did I not speak peace to 
		your mind concerning the matter, what greater witness can you have then 
		from God.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Lord had asked Oliver to 
		cast his mind from the night that he had received a witness of the 
		truthfulness of these things. That incidence that occurred for Oliver 
		back in Palmyra, New York when Oliver was working as a school teacher 
		and living in Joseph Smith Sr.s home. We learn from the Papers of 
		Joseph Smith volume 1 page 10 what it is the Lord had shown unto Oliver 
		Cowdery and had given him a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of 
		Mormon, quote:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">The 
		Lord appeared to Oliver Cowdery, and showed unto him the plates in 
		vision what the Lord was about to do through me his worthy servant.&nbsp; 
		Therefore he was desirous to come unto me to translate.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Oliver had received a vision, 
		he had been shown the plates and it was made known unto him of the 
		truthfulness of the work of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and 
		that he upon it, he had a witness, it was a powerful witness, by the 
		time he had met Joseph Smith, traveled down to Harmony, Pennsylvania, 
		and commenced the translation he had lost confidence in his first 
		witness and he was asking for a second one.&nbsp; The important principle to 
		learn here is that the Lord wanted Oliver to remember his first witness; 
		he wasnt willing to give him a second manifestation.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As a student you are at the 
		crossroads of many important decisions. You seek for answers through 
		revelation about you career path, going on a mission, or marriage. You 
		want to trust in the Lord with all you heart that he might direct your 
		path. You will pray and you will get an answer, there will be a distinct 
		impression upon you and you will feel at peace. As you go down the 
		chosen path, two months into your engagement or it could be a year or 
		two into your major youre pursuing italong the way you might lose 
		confidence in what youre doing. You like Oliver Cowdry, want a second 
		witness. Youll want to know if the course you are on is correct and 
		true. You will pray for a second witness and like Oliver Cowdery the 
		Lord has already given you a first witness of confirmation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You can make the mistake of 
		interpreting that is the will of the Lord.&nbsp; That you are not going in 
		the right direction, when in fact the Lord had already given you an 
		answer, but you had lost confidence in His answer.&nbsp; It is my suggestion 
		to you that when you receive that first impression when you first pray 
		about something to write it down.&nbsp; Make it an important part of your 
		journal and when you begin to question your course of action I would ask 
		you go back and read that entry again. This will help you to gain 
		confidence in the Lord and to trust in him with all your heart.&nbsp; </font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>When putting our trust in 
		the Lord the Proverb warns, Lean not to thine own understanding. &nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In modern revelation the Lord 
		has told us to &quot;seek learning even by study and also by faith.&quot; (</font><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://gospelink.com/library/goto-scrip?ref=dc/109/7">D&amp;C 
		109:7</a><font color="#000080">.) Seeking learning by study, we use the 
		method of reason. Seeking learning by faith, we must rely on revelation. 
		Obedient to heavenly decree, we should seek learning by reason and also 
		by revelation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In seeking learning by study and reason, we 
		examine the accumulated wisdom of various fields of knowledge, we employ 
		empirical techniques to gather new evidence, and we use the powers of 
		reasoning placed in us by our Creator. These are the normal ways of 
		seeking knowledge of the things of the world. Millions of men and women 
		are involved in this kind of search for knowledge in every imaginable 
		field of learning from the most basic practices of agriculture and 
		personal hygiene to the currently most advanced techniques of medical 
		science and space exploration, to cite only a few examples. Modern 
		civilization owes an incalculable debt to the search for knowledge by 
		study and reason.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The correct relationship between study and 
		faith in the receipt of knowledge is illustrated in Oliver Cowderys 
		attempt to translate ancient records. He failed because he took no 
		thought, but only asked God. (</font><span class="scripture1"><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/9/7#7"><span style="font-weight: normal">D&amp;C 
		9:7</span></a></span><font color="#000080">.) The Lord told him he 
		should have stud[ied] it out in [his] mind and then asked if it was 
		right. (</font><span class="scripture1"><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/9/8#8"><span style="font-weight: normal">D&amp;C 
		9:8</span></a></span><font color="#000080">.) Only then would the Lord 
		reveal whether the translation was correct or not. And only on receiving 
		that revelation could the text be written, because you cannot write 
		that which is sacred save it be given you from me. (</font><span class="scripture1"><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/9/9#9"><span style="font-weight: normal">D&amp;C 
		9:9</span></a></span><font color="#000080">.) In the acquisition of 
		sacred knowledge, scholarship and reason are not alternatives to 
		revelation. They are a means to an end, and the end is revelation from 
		God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If we seek to learn of the 
		things of God solely by reason alone, we are certain to stop short of 
		our goaleternal life. We may even wind up at the wrong destination. Why 
		is this so? On this subject God has prescribed the primacy of another 
		method. To learn the things of God, what we need is not more study and 
		reason, not more scholarship and technology, but more faith and 
		revelation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints has always encouraged its members to pursue and excel 
		in all fields of learning, acquiring knowledge by study and reason as 
		well as by faith and revelation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Boyd K. Packer gave this perceptive of 
		reason and revelation in a university environment:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;There are two opposing convictions in the 
		university environment. On the one hand, 'seeing is believing'; on the 
		other, 'believing is seeing.' Both are true! Each in its place. The 
		combining of the two individually or institutionally is the challenge of 
		life. . . .</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Each of us must accommodate the mixture of 
		reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but <i>
		requires</i> it. An individual who concentrates on either side solely 
		and alone will lose both balance and perspective. History confirms that 
		the university environment always favors reason, with the workings of 
		the Spirit made to feel uncomfortable. I know of no examples to the 
		contrary.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Packer then pleaded for &quot;the fusion of 
		reason and revelation, [which] will produce a man and a woman of 
		imperishable worth.&quot;</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1" color="#000080">4</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		I believe that to be the case at BYU-Idaho, Provo, Hawaii, and LDS 
		Business College they have successfully fused reason and revelation in 
		the classroom, the laboratory, the halls and across the campus.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">President Gordon B. Hinckley 
		exemplifies the attitude reason and revelation. He has said, I believe 
		in myself, I do not mean in an egotistical way but I believe in my 
		capacity, my capacity to do good, to make some contribution to the 
		society of which we are a part. To grow and develop and do things that 
		we may know that are possible.&nbsp; I believe in the principle that I can 
		make a difference in this world. It may be very small, but it will count 
		for the greater good.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Proverb also says in 
		all thy ways acknowledge Him.</b>&nbsp; There is no better way to 
		acknowledge our God, then through prayer. Prayer is the communication 
		link that we would have with our loving Father in Heaven.&nbsp; Since we are 
		His children and He is our Father of which He loves us very much.&nbsp; He 
		knows our needs, He knows your needs and He wants you to communicate 
		with Him through prayer.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Acknowledging the hand of the 
		Lord in our lives is very important.&nbsp; Always give thanks to your 
		Heavenly Father for all the good that comes into your life.&nbsp; You should 
		Live in thanksgiving daily for the many mercies and blessings which He 
		doth bestow upon you.&nbsp; As you take time to remember your blessings 
		youll recognize how much your Heavenly Father has done for you.&nbsp; 
		Express youre thanks to Him often in a heartfelt prayer.&nbsp; Make your 
		prayers meaningful.&nbsp; The Prophet Mormon warned that if anyone shall 
		pray and not with real intent of heart, it profiteth him nothing.&nbsp; For

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To make your prayers 
		meaningful you must pray with sincerity and with all energy of heart.&nbsp; 
		Be careful to avoid vain repetitions when you pray.&nbsp; Give serious 
		thought to your attitude and the words you use.&nbsp; To the Nephites the 
		Savior said Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name which is 
		right, believing that ye shall receive behold it shall be given unto 
		you.&nbsp; Heavenly Father hears your prayers, He may not always answer as 
		you expect but He does answer in His own time according to His own 
		will.&nbsp; Because He knows what is best for you, He may sometimes even 
		answer no, even when your petitions are sincere.&nbsp; Answers to prayers 
		can come in many different ways.&nbsp; They often come through the still 
		small voice of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The may come in circumstances of your 
		life or through the kinds acts of those around you.&nbsp; As you continue to 
		draw near to your Heavenly Father through prayer, youll recognize more 
		readily His merciful and wise answers to your pleadings.&nbsp; You will find 
		that He is your refuge and strength, a very pleasant help in troubled 
		times.&nbsp; Youll notice when you read your scriptures that sometimes you 
		will feel answers to your questions or you might be listening to General 
		Conference.&nbsp; Again answers come through prayers by those around us and 
		particularly by our prophet, seers, and revelators also love us and 
		desire for us to do the will of God.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One particular promise the 
		Lord made through President Thomas S. <span class="hit">Monson</span>, 
		then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, is a story worth repeating. 
		It is the story of the how those who live behind the Iron Curtain 
		obtained a temple. It is a story of how the Lord directed the path of 
		President Monson It is the story of a people who trusted in the Lord and 
		applied reason and revelation to bring about the Lords purposes. 
		President Monson was assigned to go beyond the wall to Eastern Germany 
		in 1968. He reported:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When I made my initial visit 
		beyond the wall there was a time of fear on the part of our members as 
		they struggled in the performance of their duties.&nbsp; I found the dullness 
		of despair upon the faces of many passerbys and bright and beautiful 
		expression of love emanating from our members.&nbsp; In Goerlitz the building 
		which we met in was shell shocked from the war, but the interior 
		reflected the tender care of our leaders in bringing the brightness and 
		cleanliness of an otherwise shabby and gloomy structure.&nbsp; The Church had 
		survived both the war and the Cold War which followed.&nbsp; The singing of 
		the Saints brightened every soul.&nbsp; I was touched with their sincerity.&nbsp; 
		I was humbled by their poverty.&nbsp; They had so little.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My heart filled with sorrow 
		because they had no patriarch.&nbsp; They had no wards or stakes they were 
		just branches.&nbsp; They could not receive temple blessings neither 
		endowments nor sealings.&nbsp; No official visitor had come from Church 
		headquarters in a long time.&nbsp; Members were forbidden to leave the 
		country.&nbsp; Yet they trusted in the Lord with all their hearts.&nbsp; In all 
		their ways they acknowledged Him.&nbsp; This was evident in their prayers.&nbsp; I 
		stood at the pulpit, said Elder Monson, and with tear-filled eyes and 
		with a voice choked with emotion I made a promise to the people.&nbsp; If you 
		will remain true and faithful to the commandments of God, every blessing 
		any member of the Church enjoys in any other country will be yours.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That night as I realized what 
		I had promised, I dropped to my knees and prayed.&nbsp; Heavenly Father, Im 
		on Thine errand, this is Thy Church.&nbsp; Ive spoken words that came not 
		from me, but from Thee and Thy Son.&nbsp; Wilt Thou therefore fulfill the 
		promise and the lives of these noble people.&nbsp; There coursed through my 
		mind the words of the great Psalm, Be still and know that I am God, the 
		heavenly virtue of patience then was required.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And little by little the 
		promise was fulfilled.&nbsp; First patriarchs were ordained, then lesson 
		manuals were produced in their native language.&nbsp; Wards were formed, 
		stakes were created, chapels and stake centers were begun, completed and 
		dedicated.&nbsp; And then the miracle of miracles. A holy temple of God was 
		permitted, designed, constructed, and then dedicated in Freiburg.&nbsp; 
		Finally after an absence of fifty years approval was then granted for 
		full time missionaries to enter the nation for local youth to serve 
		elsewhere in the world.&nbsp; Then like the wall of Jericho, the Berlin Wall 
		crumbled, and freedom with its attended responsibilities returned.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Elder Monson continues, All 
		of the parts of the precious promise of the twenty seven years earlier 
		were fulfilled save one.&nbsp; The tiny Goerlitz branch where the promise had 
		been made still had no chapel of its own.&nbsp; Now even that dream became a 
		reality.&nbsp; The building was approved and completed, dedicated in1995 27 
		years after the promise.&nbsp; Sister Monson and I along with Elder and 
		Sister Dieder Uchtdorf held a meeting to dedicate the Goerlitz chapel.&nbsp; 
		Same songs were sung as were rendered twenty seven years ago.&nbsp; The 
		members knew the significance of the occasion, marking the total 
		fulfillment of the promise.&nbsp; They wept, they sang songs of the righteous 
		were indeed a prayer unto the Lord and had been answered with a blessing 
		upon their heads.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In conclusion I share a final contrast between 
		the ways of the Lord and the ways of the world. It is an incident 
		recorded in the Gospel of John. During his journey across Samaria, Jesus 
		rested at Jacob's well. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and he 
		asked her for a drink. When she marveled that a Jew would speak to a 
		Samaritan, he told her that if she knew who he was, she would ask him 
		for living water. Seeing that he had no implement to draw water from the 
		deep well, she asked him how he could obtain any water to give her.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Before reminding ourselves of Jesus' answer, we 
		should note, He need not ask for water at the well, for tithes and 
		offerings at the Church, or for personal service in any other work of 
		his kingdom. He asks us for these things, just as he sought a drink from 
		the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well, so that he can bless us with 
		something of far greater importance to us than that which we give. That 
		is the Lord's way.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In answer to the question how he could give the 
		Samaritan woman living water without any way to draw it from the well, 
		Jesus answered: &quot;Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
		but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never 
		thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of 
		water springing up into everlasting life.&quot; (</font><a style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://gospelink.com/library/goto-scrip?ref=John/4/13">John 
		4:13-14</a><font color="#000080">.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus taught us how to obtain the living water. 
		The teaching he gave the Samaritan woman reminds us, even as we are 
		involved in acquiring the worldly skill and knowledge and methods to 
		draw water from earthly wells, that what we obtain from Jacob's well 
		gives only temporary relief. The water of Jacob's well, however 
		significant in satisfying temporary earthly desires, is insignificant in 
		value beside what we can obtain from Jesus' words and from his atoning 
		sacrifice. And when we seek to obtain or share that living water, we 
		must do it in the Lord's way by Trust[ing] in the Lord with all thine 
		heart and lead not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways 
		acknowledge Him and he shall direct thy paths.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus 
		Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">What a great blessing it is for me to be here with you on this lovely campus. I was impressed
with the students and the campus when I was here with the Tabernacle Choir a few years ago,
and have looked forward to being here again. There is a great spirit here at Brigham Young
University-Idaho. You students are not only blessed to be here, you are also a blessing to those
you meet throughout the world as you carry forth the banner of truth and righteousness in your
words and actions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">One day, my mother was shopping with two preschool daughters. The two-year-old became
upset at being confined to the grocery cart and not being able to roam about freely like her four-year-old sister. She began to cry in frustration. All attempts to calm her were to no avail. As she
began to wail louder, the four-year-old said to her sister, &#8220;Christie! You don&#8217;t need to cry. Don&#8217;t
you know you&#8217;re a child of God?&#8221;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Do you know who you really are?</span> Think about that question. If you were asked by a stranger,
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; most of you would probably say your name, thinking that would be a sufficient
answer. Or you might say that you are a son or daughter of your parents. If that person knows
your parents or siblings, or some other relative, they may feel that they know something about
you. But, you all know that is not the whole story.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Elder Russell M. Nelson said, <i>&#8220;If my fondest wish could be granted, it would be that we know
who we really are, and that we know we come from premortal realms where we were numbered
&#8216;among the noble and great ones&#8217; who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church
of God&#8221;</i> (&#8220;Integrity of Heart,&#8221; <i>Ensign</i>, August 1995, 23). 
		</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">So, how did you get to this point in your life? As the turtle said when he looked around and
found himself on top of a fence post, &#8220;It&#8217;s clear, I didn&#8217;t get here all by myself.&#8221; To whom do we
owe our thanks for our situation?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">First, we must acknowledge that we are children of God with divine potential, and that He has
blessed us to come to earth at this time. The gospel has been restored in this dispensation, and we
have had the opportunity to accept it, and to receive the blessings of the atonement of Jesus
Christ. You can draw upon His power to help you become like Him. We are eternally indebted to
our Father and our Elder Brother for this great plan of happiness. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Second, we are blessed to have come to earth to reside in a family. Families are to love and
nurture children, providing opportunities for learning and growth. Regardless of how good or
bad we think our families are, we owe our thanks to them because they have given us life.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Third, our present situation has been affected by the lives of many people who have gone before
us. We may not realize it, but our ancestors played a role in how we have become who we are.
For example, many of you might have ancestors who accepted the gospel and remained faithful
to the Church. Without their influence, you might not be here at BYU&#8211;Idaho. Perhaps you do not
know your progenitors personally, but they know you and they are depending on you to carry on
their name. Let me illustrate this idea with a story about a family.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Generational Effects</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Last year, I attended a play at Brigham Young University in Provo called &#8220;Handing Down the
Names&#8221; by Steven Dietz. While the characters were fictional, the play was a family story, based
on historical facts. The play begins with a woman named Irina living in Colorado in the 1940s.
She introduces the play by saying that each family has a history but the beginning is difficult to
find. She takes off her wedding ring and places it on the table.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />The play then shifts to the early 1900s, showing descendants of the Dorn family leaving their
home along the Volga River to come to America. Unfortunately, the mother dies on board ship,
but the father carries on with his three adult children. Upon arriving at Ellis Island, one of the
daughters, Katie, is found to have an eye infection. She is sent back to Russia, while the rest of
the family helplessly watch her go. They move to Colorado where they work hard to raise
enough money for Katie and her husband to join them. They pray constantly that their family can
be reunited. One year follows the next and they cannot understand why Katie&#8217;s family does not
come. We find out later that Katie never received the money or the letters due to political
interference.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Katie eventually has a son named Adam. Before she dies, she tells him to do whatever he can to
go to America and join her family. Just as World War II is starting in Europe, Adam finds
someone who offers to help him leave Russia and go to America. However, as he enters
Hamburg, Germany, preparing to board the ship for his journey across the Atlantic, he is seized
and conscripted into the German Army. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He is captured and sent to America as a prisoner of war. Ironically, or maybe providentially, his
imprisonment is in the same area of northern Colorado where his now deceased grandfather and
uncle had lived. The prisoners are forced to work for farmers in the area, and that is where he
meets Irina, a young woman whose father was also from the German colonies along the Volga
River. He recognizes that she is one of his own people. After the war, he is sent back to
Germany, but later manages to return to Irina in Colorado, bringing the wedding ring that had
been handed down for many generations. Ruth Dorn, from 200 years earlier, then enters the
stage, saying, &#8220;<i>He farms now, on land where he&#8217;d been held prisoner. She wears a ring that I
wore, nearly two hundred years ago. And their son, Henry, wears a name that belonged to my
husband. A name seven generations in the making&#8221; </i>(Steven Dietz, <i>Handing Down the Names</i>,
Manuscript, 1994, p. 115).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This family story touched me because it showed how the individuals who lived in the twentieth
century were profoundly influenced by their family members from previous generations. You
may not realize it, but your life and situation have come about in part because of the decisions
made by your ancestors. The playwright Steven Dietz stated, <i>&#8220;We can look back . . . because
they chose to look forward&#8221; </i>(Steven Dietz, 25 April 1995, Seattle, as quoted in BYU College of
Fine Arts and Communications, <i>Handing Down the Names </i>playbill, 2005, 19).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">We may not understand why we were born to our particular family with its unique heritage, but
we can be sure that our ancestors are a part of us. Our current lives are like a tapestry being
woven with threads coming from various people and places. God is the master weaver. He can
help us gather the loose ends of the tapestry, enabling us to turn our hearts to our fathers, as
Malachi prophesied.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">An example of a tapestry being woven by the hand of God can be found in the life and family of
the Prophet Joseph Smith. Last year, during the celebration of the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his birth,
we were often reminded of his foreordination to restore the gospel of Jesus Christ. His life was
dedicated to the service of the Lord, and the work he brought forth in restoring the gospel has
blessed millions of people. Brigham Young taught that Joseph Smith was foreordained before
the world was to be the man who would </font></p>

Lord had his eyes upon him, and upon his father, and upon his father&#8217;s father,
and upon their progenitors clear back to Abraham, and from Abraham to the
flood, from the flood to Enoch, and from Enoch to Adam. He has watched that
family and that blood as it has circulated from its fountain to the birth of that man
		</i>(<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>, John A. Widtsoe, ed. (Salt Lake City, Utah:
Deseret Book Company, 1954, 108).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />For example, many of my ancestors were early members of the restored Church. They were
pioneers who left their homes and families and journeyed to the Great Salt Lake Valley. They
had the faith to wade through affliction, even though it meant losing loved ones along the way.
They walked over a thousand miles, sometimes wearing only rags to cover their feet after their
shoes were worn out. Yet, they did it all in response to a prophet&#8217;s call.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />Essentially, our lives have been greatly influenced by the lives of many people that came before
us. You might be saying to yourself, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any pioneer ancestors. What have they done
for me?&#8221; Even those who have found the gospel in recent years have been influenced by the faith
of the early pioneers. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>a close kinship to those early pioneers who crossed the plains. They are my
spiritual ancestry, as they are for each and every member of the Church,

the world </i>(&#8220;The Global Church Blessed by the Voice of the Prophets,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign</i>,
November 2002, 10).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You and your family might be today&#8217;s pioneers of faithfulness, just like Elder Uchtdorf and his
family were in their land.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sister Elaine S. Dalton a counselor in the Young Women&#8217;s General Presidency said that during a
trip she made to Nauvoo, she pondered how her ancestors could have given up everything they
had, suffering persecution and trials as they traveled across the plains. She wondered why they
had sacrificed so much for their testimony of the gospel. She had the impression come to her that
her ancestors and those early Saints would say,<i> &#8220;We did this for you.&#8221; 
		</i>If they did so much for us,
we need to do something for them. One thing we can do is live up to the heritage we have been
given (<i>Ensign,</i> "We Did This For You" November 2004, 89).</font></p>

<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Our Responsibility to Live Up to Our Name</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I&#8217;d like to remind you of the story about President George Albert Smith. He was very ill and one
day lost consciousness. In that state he felt that he had gone beyond the veil into the Spirit
World. He saw a man that he recognized as his grandfather, the apostle George A. Smith, after
whom he had been named. They approached each other, then his grandfather stopped and said,
		<i>&#8220;I would like to know what you have done with my name.&#8221; 
		</i>President Smith saw his whole life
pass before him in review, and afterwards he smiled and said to his grandfather,<i> &#8220;I have never
done anything with your name of which you need be ashamed.&#8221; </i>What joy and gratitude he had to
know that he had kept his grandfather&#8217;s name unsullied (<i>The Teachings of George Albert Smith</i>,
Robert and Susan McIntosh, eds. Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft Inc., 1996, 131-133).</font></p>

<font color="#000080">To help us see the eternal view of the family, President Gordon B. Hinckley talked about being
at a temple dedication along with his daughter, grand-daughter, and great-grand-daughter. As he
sat there, he reflected on his heritage. His great-grandfather was the first one in his line to join
the Church. His grandfather had been baptized in Nauvoo, and his own father had also served
faithfully in the Church. He said: &#160;</font></p>

generations&#8211;three before me and three after me. In that sacred and hallowed
house there passed through my mind a sense of the tremendous obligation that
was mine to pass on all that I had received as an inheritance from my forebears
to the generations who have now come after me</i> (&#8220;Keep the Chain Unbroken,&#8221;

<font color="#000080">You might be familiar with the comic strip, &#8220;Pickles&#8221; written by Brian Crane. On July 15, 2001,
the comic strip showed a grandfather and his grandson talking to each other. The grandfather
asks:&#160;</font></p>

<font color="#000080"><i>&#8220;Have you been a good boy lately, Nelson?&#8221;</i></font></p>

<font color="#000080">The grandson&#8217;s reply is, <i>&#8220;Yeah, I guess.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">The grandfather says, <i>&#8220;Good. A lot of people are counting on you.&#8221;</i></font></p>

<font color="#000080">You each have your own personal fan club, even if you don&#8217;t realize it. Perhaps there is someone
like a parent, a sibling, a spouse, or a friend that cheers for you when you do great things, and
sorrows with you when you are discouraged. In addition, somewhere beyond the veil, there are
many people who are cheering for you and depending on you, because you belong to them and
they want you to succeed.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In addition to living up to our heritage, what else should we do to handle that &#8220;ancestor
pressure?&#8221; Think of all those people who have gone before us and are now watching over us and
depending on us to help them. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, <i>&#8220;The greatest responsibility in
this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead&#8221; </i>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph
Smith</i>, Joseph Fielding Smith, ed., Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1938, 356</span>).Why would
he say that? I believe it is because of the eternal nature of families and the importance of the Plan
of Happiness. Heavenly Father invites all of His children to return to live with Him someday. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are some requirements for entering into the celestial kingdom, however. Jesus taught,
		<i>&#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8221; 
		</i>(John 3:3). According to this statement, all men and women who have ever lived on the earth or
who will live on the earth must be baptized by proper authority to enter into the celestial
kingdom.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many Christians throughout the world have wondered what happens to the billions of people
who have died without the knowledge of Christ. The Lord revealed the answer to the Prophet
Joseph Smith, as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants Section 137. The Prophet had a vision of
the celestial kingdom in which he saw the Father and the Son, along with prophets such as Adam
and Abraham. In addition, he saw his brother Alvin who had died before the Church was
organized, and consequently had not been baptized. Joseph said he <i>&#8220;marveled how it was that he
had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom&#8221;  </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 137:6).<i>
</i>Verse seven
records: <i>&#8220;Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died without a
knowledge of this gospel who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be
heirs of the celestial kingdom&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 137:7). What a comforting promise! It
means that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are both just and merciful. A way has been
provided for all of our spirit brothers and sisters to have the opportunity to hear the gospel and
be baptized in order to return to our Father in Heaven.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The foundation of the work for the redemption of the dead was laid in 1823, when Moroni came
to Joseph Smith and restated Malachi&#8217;s prophecy that Elijah would come to turn
		<i>&#8220;the heart of
the children to their fathers&#8221;</i> (Malachi 4:6). Significantly, Joseph Smith learned of this prophecy
prior to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the organization of the Church. Temple
and family history work must be very important to the Lord. This prophecy was fulfilled on
April 3, 1836, in the Kirtland Temple. On that day the priesthood keys of the sealing power were
given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery under the hand of Elijah. The hearts of the children
began to turn toward their fathers at that time, as people throughout the world became interested
in their heritage.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has provided many resources to help us fulfill
our obligation to our ancestors. The Family History Library in Salt Lake City and the more than
4,000 Family History Centers throughout the world are available for anyone that desires to
search for their ancestors. The internet web-site, www.familysearch.org, is a great place to begin
your family history research. There is so much we can do to learn more about our ancestors, and
the opportunities become greater as technological advances make family history research easier
and easier.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Presidency of the Seventy reminded us that the time and the
resources the Church puts behind the commitment to redeem the dead are <i>&#8220;an expression of our
witness concerning Jesus Christ. It constitutes as powerful a statement as we can make
concerning His divine character and mission&#8221; </i>(<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#8220;The Redemption of the Dead and the Testimony
of Jesus,&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Ensign</span></i>, November 2000, 10). The Church would not expend the resources and energy
it does to build temples and provide family history data to the world, if we did not believe that
Jesus Christ is <i>&#8220;the way, the truth, and the life&#8221; </i>(John 14:6) and has invited all people to come
unto the Father through Him.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />&#160;Joseph Smith taught that <i>&#8220;they without us cannot be made perfect&#8211;neither can we without our
dead be made perfect&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 128:15). Salvation is a family affair. If we want
to be united eternally with our family, we need to help our brothers and sisters who have gone
before us to be sealed as eternal families as well. We can pray that the Spirit of Elijah will enter
into our hearts and assist us with our obligation of redeeming our ancestors.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In summary, we need to remember that our family heritage, both earthly and celestial, has
enabled us to be who we are today. We can learn who we really are by finding ourselves in our
ancestors. In this process, we will feel gratitude, admiration, and love for them. We will
recognize how their lives are intertwined with ours, and one day, when we meet them beyond the
veil, we will know them. I offer you a challenge to prepare for the dedication of the Rexburg
Temple by searching for your own family names to take to the temple when it opens. Attending
the temple will have a great deal of meaning for you if you can perform ordinances for
individuals that you have researched. Just think <i>&#8220;how great shall be your joy&#8221; 
		</i>if you bring souls
unto Christ through your family history research and temple work (Doctrine and Covenants
18:15-16).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My testimony is that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have provided a plan of happiness
through which we and our families can progress to become like Them. Performing temple
ordinances allows our ancestors to have access to these eternal blessings. I testify that you will
gain a greater love for your family and for the Savior and our Heavenly Father as you participate
in the redemption of the dead. You <span style="text-decoration: underline">will</span> learn who you really are. I know this to be true and leave
my witness with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am happy for the opportunity to be with you today. You look good. By that I mean you look
fresh, clean, enthusiastic, and wholesome. You are good examples of what disciples of Christ
ought to be. I also liked the way you sang the opening song. Do you remember what today is? Of
course, it&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day. I hope that by mentioning this I have saved some of you from
problems later tonight. There is still time to buy a Valentine&#8217;s gift. 
		</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Valentine&#8217;s Day can be a lot of fun. A couple of years ago my wife and I decided that we didn&#8217;t
need to get Valentine&#8217;s gifts for each other. However, on Valentine&#8217;s Day I could not resist and
bought her a gift as I was going home from work. I slipped it into the house and hid it under her
pillow so she would find it as she prepared to go to bed. That night, I watched in anticipation as
she moved her pillow and enjoyed her happy surprise at the gift. I then removed my pillow only
to find she had hidden a gift for me. What a happy Valentine&#8217;s Day! </span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But Valentine&#8217;s Day is not always happy for everyone. I often think about Charlie Brown not
getting any valentines, and it hurts my heart. I was happy to hear a few years ago that in some of
our area high schools the boys all pooled their money and gave every girl in the school a rose on
Valentine&#8217;s Day so they would all know that someone cared for them. What an impressive
display of sensitivity. </span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When I learned that I would be speaking on Valentine&#8217;s Day, I knew that I had to speak about
love. I would like to take a poll. If you know someone loves you, raise your hand. (People in
overflow areas, raise your hands too.) Next question: If you love someone, raise your hand.
These are not trick questions, but every hand should have gone up on both questions because, at
the very least, we all should love our Father in Heaven and know that He loves us.

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The author Victor Hugo said, 
		<i>&#8220;The supreme happiness of life is the conviction of being loved for
yourself, or, more correctly speaking, loved in spite of yourself&#8221; </i>(Victor Hugo, 
		<i>Les Miserables</i>,
[1938] 162). I believe that to both love and be loved is essential to our existence. Love is
fundamental to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to our very society. </span>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The word love (or its variations) is used 628 times in the scriptures. The two greatest
commandments are to love the Lord God with all your heart and to love your neighbor as
yourself. One of our ultimate goals is to learn to love the way God loves.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Love has many faces. It can be the romantic feelings between a man and a woman. It can be the
feeling of a parent for a child or a child for a parent. It can be the tie that binds friends. It can be
the way we feel about humanity in general. It can describe the relationship between God and
man. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I would like to spend time talking about each of these manifestations today.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is no surprise that college students are focused to a great extent on the romantic feelings
between a man and a woman. It is a natural part of our makeup to want to love and be loved. In
fact, this kind of love permeates our society at every level. Philosophers talk about it; we sing
about it; we watch it portrayed in movies; we dream about it; and I think we all hope it will
happen to us. I would like to share a few thoughts I have found about love as I have prepared for
this talk. </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Plato said:

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is natural that college students focus on love because this is the time of your life when you
often find the person you will love throughout eternity. With a little luck, you will end up
marrying that person too. As old as I am, I can well remember falling in love with my wife. It
was not an easy process. I had been back from my mission for nearly a year when I first dated
Marilyn. We had common friends and were friends with each other, but she was waiting
faithfully for a missionary. Probably one of my first motivations to date her was to (as we called
it at the time) &#8220;cut his grass.&#8221; It is to Marilyn&#8217;s credit that I had to ask her out about six times
before she reluctantly agreed to go with me. It was right here on this campus. In fact, for our first
date we went to a play in the Kirkham Auditorium. It was exciting to fall in love. You know how
it is. Somehow you suddenly run into each other between just about every class. I remember
studying in the library and having them threaten to throw me out because I kept talking to her. I
am pretty sure that I was convinced that I loved her and wanted her to marry me long before she
felt that way. We took classes together. I went to devotional with her. In my innocence I thought
that surely no one ever felt love more intensely than I did at that time. There were challenging
times along the way, and a couple of times I thought I had lost her to someone else. But through
my patient persistence, she finally agreed to marry me. I guess like some of the students I visited
with in preparing this talk, I reached a point where the thought of ever doing anything that would
hurt her was completely abhorrent to me. I wanted to do everything I could to make her happy.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It was only after we were married that I discovered that even though love can happen naturally,
it takes constant work to keep it strong. One of the important things about a marriage is that it is
a living thing; it either grows or atrophies. And like any living thing, it must be nourished daily
to remain healthy and strong. It takes healthy doses of hearing &#8220;I love you&#8221; or receiving
unsolicited small and large acts of kindness and thoughtfulness to make a marriage strong. It is
amazing what can happen if a husband helps wash the dishes or vacuums a floor or makes a bed
or when a wife brings an ice cold glass of lemonade to her husband as he labors pulling weeds in
the garden. That is what helps make a marriage strong. </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Over the years Marilyn and I have played a game called &#8220;I love you as much as . . .&#8221; Some of my
best efforts have been &#8220;I love you as much as all the dust particles in the air in Idaho on a dry,
windy, summer day&#8221; or &#8220;I love you more than all the national debt.&#8221; I have learned that romantic
little thoughts like these go a long way towards keeping love alive and strong.

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I was falling in love, I also learned a couple of other important facts. First, in most cases,
people won&#8217;t know you love them unless you tell them. (I know that sounds simple, but it is
profound.) Second, if you feel the Lord has revealed who you should love, it only counts if he
also reveals it to the other person. Too often young men and women fail to realize that receiving
a confirmation that someone might make a good mate for them does not mean anything unless
the other person gets the same confirmation. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A young man once told me of his experience of praying about a girl he was dating and being
convinced that she was the one he should marry. The next time he went out with her, he told her
of his experience. Her response was that it could not be true because she had planned to break up
with him that night. Naturally, he was devastated and wondered where he had gone wrong. One
of his mistakes was to think that his inspiration could hold her captive. </span>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We all know that love between a man and woman can grow until it becomes a force of
tremendous power. I came across a story that illustrates this point. Variations of the tale are
found in the folklore of Eastern Europe, but it was said to have happened during the Middle
Ages in Germany. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The year was 1141 and Wolf, the duke of Bavaria, was besieged inside his castle of Weinsberg
by the army of Frederick and his brother the Emperor Konrad.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The siege had lasted long, and Wolf realized he had no choice but to surrender. Messengers rode
back and forth, terms were proposed, conditions allowed, and arrangements completed. Wolf and
his army prepared to give themselves over to their bitter enemy. But the wives of Weinsberg
were not prepared to lose everything. They sent a message to Konrad, asking the governor to
promise safe passage for all women in the garrison that they might come out with as many of
their valuables as they could carry on their backs. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The request was graciously granted, and soon the castle gates opened. Out came the women&#8211; but
not as supposed. They carried neither gold nor jewels on their backs, but each one of them was
bending under the weight of her husband, whom she hoped to save from the vengeance of the
conquering army.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Konrad was so moved by this extraordinary act that he made peace with the duke of Bavaria on
much more favorable terms than expected. These women gave new meaning to the idea of
supporting their husbands.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The first reference in the scriptures to love between a man and a woman is the love that Isaac
had for Rebekah. The second reference tells of the love Jacob had for Rachel. We talk about how
much we would sacrifice for the girl we love, but Jacob sets the standard. You remember that
Jacob&#8217;s mother did not want him to marry any of the local girls, so she sent him on a journey to
find a wife from her extended family. Jacob arrived at the home of his uncle Laban and
immediately fell in love with the beautiful Rachel. In the spirit of &#8220;Johnny Lingo and the Eight-Cow Wife,&#8221; Jacob volunteered to work for Laban for seven years to get Rachel for his wife. That
is the standard guys. How many of you would sacrifice seven years just to get the girl you love?
It was no problem for Jacob. In fact the scriptures say,<i> &#8220;And Jacob served seven years for
Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her&#8221;</i> (Genesis 29:20).</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But as you know, that is not the end of the story. Laban was not totally honest. When Jacob went
in to his wife, it was not until the next morning that he found he had married not Rachel but the
tender-eyed sister Leah. Of course, Jacob protested; and his now father-in-law said, &#8220;Oh right. I
made a mistake, but you can have Rachel if you will work for me for another seven years.&#8221;
(Laban knew he had a good thing going.) So Jacob worked for 14 years to get Rachel, the girl of
his dreams. You might say the moral of this story is to never trust a father-in-law, but that would
be a mistake because most fathers-in-law are pretty good guys. Maybe its best not to draw any
morals but just to note that Jacob was willing to pay a very high price to get the girl of his
dreams. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In summary, romantic love is an important part of our lives and, in fact, is essential to
perpetuating the human race. There is a lot of truth to the old song that says &#8220;love is a many
splendored thing.&#8221; It is the spice in our lives, and we all hope it will happen to us. But it takes
constant nurturing for it to remain strong. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I would now like to shift to the love between parents and children. This is a powerful kind of
love and can be compared to the love God has for His children. The first mention of love in the
scriptures refers to the love Abraham had for his son Isaac (Genesis 22:2). It is significant that
the test God chose for Abraham was to sacrifice his son that he loved. The comparison of God
sacrificing His son for us is obvious. What a difficult thing to ask a loving father to do, but
Abraham proved he was willing to do anything the Lord commanded. After passing this test, the
Lord promised him blessings that would extend throughout the eternities. </span>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Old Testament tells of Abraham&#8217;s love of his son, but the love mothers have for their
children is legendary. They will starve or put themselves in harms way to protect their children.
Mothers willingly go into the valley of the shadow of death simply to bring children into the
world. They literally sacrifice their lives rearing their children. The fact that the children are
flesh of their mother&#8217;s flesh and that mothers give life-long service to their children creates one
of the strongest bonds of love in existence. Mothers love their children so completely that they
are totally vulnerable. Too often children thoughtlessly wound their mothers by not treating this
&#8220;mother&#8217;s love&#8221; with sacred respect. Many young people don&#8217;t come to an awareness of their
love for their mothers, as well as their fathers, until they go away to school or to work. I would
counsel you that if you have gained an awareness of what you owe your mother and of the love
you feel for her, make sure you put your arms around her and tell her. As I said earlier, it is
difficult for people to figure out that you love them unless you tell them. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another important face of love is the love between special friends. Sometimes, friends can
become even closer than brothers and sisters. The love between friends can even rival the love
parents have for their children. I recently read a story about friends who loved each other so
much that they were willing to sacrifice their lives for each other. </span>

The scriptures tell us that Jonathan <i>&#8220;. . . loved him </i>[David] <i>as he loved his own soul&#8221;

20:17) which, after all, is the same as loving your neighbor as yourself, isn&#8217;t it.

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">David had been anointed by the prophet Samuel to replace Saul as king over Israel. Jonathan, as
Saul&#8217;s oldest son, was in line to replace his father as king. Because of his great love for his friend
David, Jonathan was willing to give up any claim to the throne. His loyalty to David was
exhibited when David said he felt he should leave the King&#8217;s palace because it was evident that
Saul wanted to kill him. Jonathan told David to hide by a rock, and he would try to soften his
father. Jonathan spoke for David with his father, but Saul simply aimed his anger at Jonathan
and tried to kill him with his javelin. With a sad heart Jonathan went to his friend and told him
he would have to leave. David went away for a long time. Still, both he and Jonathan were
faithful friends to the end. </span></font></p>

		<i>&#8220;Vern, get him a clutch. Get him a throwout bearing, too. And get him a pressure
plate. That should take care of it.&#8221; </i>The father handed all of the parts to the young
man who had attempted robbery and said, <i>&#8220;Take these. And here&#8217;s the
transmission, too. You don&#8217;t have to steal, young man. Just ask for it. There&#8217;s a

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Brother Vern Crowley said he learned an everlasting lesson in love that day. The
young man came back to the lot often. Voluntarily, month by month, he paid for
all of the parts Vic Crowley had given him, including the transmission. During
those visits, he asked Vern why his dad was the way he was and why he did what
he did. Vern told him something of their Latter-day Saint beliefs and how much
his father loved the Lord and loved people. Eventually the would-be thief was
baptized. Vern later said, <i>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard now to describe the feelings I had and what I
went through in that experience. I, too, was young. I had caught my crook. I was
going to extract the utmost penalty. But my father taught me a different way.&#8221;

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Every one of us has either had or will have the opportunity and challenge to follow the Savior&#8217;s
admonition and show love to our enemies. It might be in the form of forgiving someone who has
injured us in some way. It might come as the opportunity to help someone who has stolen from
us as illustrated in President Hunter&#8217;s story. Or it might come in the form of making peace with a
roommate who has irritated us for some reason. If we look at these cases with an honest heart
and with a true desire to follow Christ, we may find to our amazement and chagrin that
sometimes we are the problem that needs to be fixed. I have wondered what would have
happened had the young thief in President Hunter&#8217;s story not eventually paid for the parts and
had stolen again. Would Brother Crowley then be justified in turning him over to the law? I
suppose there would still be some alternatives available which might lead to the young man
changing his ways. I believe that it would be essential that some effort be made to ensure that the
young man did not repeat his actions in the future. The important thing would be that any action
taken should be done in love. </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The highest manifestation of love is charity. Elder Bruce R. McConkie defined charity this way:</span>&#160;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Charity is more than love, far more; it is everlasting love, perfect love, the pure
love of Christ which endureth forever. It is love so centered in righteousness that
the possessor has no aim or desire except for the eternal welfare of his own soul
and for the souls of those around him</i> (Bruce R. McConkie, <i>Mormon Doctrine</i>,
[1966], 121). </span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us 
		<i>&#8220;And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond
of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 88:125). </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">

chapters. </span></font></p>

heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who
are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God;
that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that
we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen</i> (Moroni
7:46-48).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We might say then that charity is love that has been purified or sanctified. It focuses not only on
the expression of love, but on the intent. I might love my wife, might have great affection for her
and spend my life telling her and showing her of my love, but unless that love comes to focus
not on making her happy but on her eternal welfare, it will ultimately come to naught. If I love
my neighbor only because I know it is the thing to do, that won't be enough. Charity is celestial
love, and our goal is to live so that we and those we love might share that love in the company of
our Eternal Father in the celestial kingdom. Ultimately, that is what our lives are all about.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Given Elder McConkie&#8217;s definition of charity as
		<i>&#8220;. . . love so centered in righteousness that the
possessor has no aim or desire except for the eternal welfare of his own soul and for the souls of
those around him,&#8221; </i>it is easy to understand why the love parents have for their children comes
close to the pure love of Christ. Parents in the Church, like Christ, want their children to be
saved and exalted in the celestial kingdom. Parents often measure their success in raising their
children by how righteous their children are. As a youth I heard my father trying to comfort a
neighbor who was mourning for a wayward son by reminding him that the son had been taught
well and was simply exercising his agency. It didn&#8217;t matter. The parent still blamed himself and
felt that he had failed.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In summary, it is important to give and receive romantic love; it is important to have strong
friendships; and it is important to love our neighbors as ourselves. But each of those
manifestations of love will come to naught unless we develop them to the higher plane where
our motive for loving becomes the eternal welfare of those we love. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As he prepared to give his last blessing to his children, Lehi recounted some of the trials of his
life and then concluded, &#8220;<i>But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have beheld
his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love</i>&#8221; (2 Nephi 1:15).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is my prayer that we, like Lehi, can come to feel that we are,

</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is winter 1844, and the Prophet Joseph Smith is Lieutenant General of the Nauvoo Legion, mayor of
the city which has become the largest and most flourishing in all of Illinois, and revelator to the Saints.
But he is a man whose time is running out. To Elizabeth Rollins he had confided in the spring of 1844,<i>
&#8220;I must seal my testimony with my blood.&#8221;</i> That testament is of no force, Paul said, until the death of the
testator.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The brethren became anxious about his life, so often did he express the sentiment that they must carry
on in his absence. Brigham Young, for one recalled: <i>&#8220;I heard Joseph say many a time, &#8216;I shall not live
until I am forty years of age.&#8217;&#8221; </i>At another time Brigham Young added, 
		<i>&#8220;Yet we all cherished hopes that
that would be a false prophecy, and we should keep him for ever with us; we thought our faith would
outreach it, but we were mistaken.&#8221; </i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Wilford Woodruff, who conversed with the Prophet just after April Conference 1844, recalled that he
later sent ten of the Twelve east on a mission, and that the Prophet seemed to linger in saying goodbye
to him. Then, looking him through and through, he said, <i>&#8220;Brother Woodruff, I want you to go, and if you
do not you will die.&#8221; </i>And he looked unspeakably sorrowful, as if weighed down by a foreboding of
something dreadful.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">On the other hand, because he had so often escaped the vilifyings and the attacks of his enemies, some
believed that he was invincible. In one sermon he said, <i>&#8220;Some have supposed that Brother Joseph could
not die; but this is a mistake.&#8221;</i> He added, <i>&#8220;Having now accomplished 
		</i>[my work], <i>I have not at present
any lease of my life. I am as liable to die as other men.&#8221;</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">During that last winter he manifested four dominant anxieties. The first anxiety related to the temple. He
yearned for it to be finished. For example, he with Hyrum went from house to house in Nauvoo and
recommitted the Saints to give of time and means to the speedy erection of that building. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Often he would ride out on his horse, Old Charlie, to the temple site, longing and praying that the Saints
would be able to complete it and receive the blessings to be given therein before they were driven and
scattered. He anticipated and prophesied that they would be driven and scattered. 
		</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph&#8217;s anxiety about the temple was compounded by his second anxiety concerning the records of the
Church, that they be kept, preserved, and accurately transmitted. That was the responsibility of several
of his scribes. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One of them was Willard Richards, a loyal man who often burned candles until midnight, writing with
his quill pen. To several others he spoke of the necessity of accurate record-keeping, and he lamented in
a priesthood meeting with &#8220;deep sorrow&#8221; that the Church had not kept adequate minutes. Then Joseph
said, <i>&#8220;Here let me prophesy. The time will come when, if you neglect to do this thing, you will fall by the
hands of unrighteous men.&#8221;</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If all of the Twelve then in Nauvoo had promptly recorded the meeting in which Joseph rolled off the
responsibility from his shoulders upon them and charged them, in what he called his last charge, to go
forward in building the kingdom, any claim that he intended someone else to succeed to the Presidency
of the Church would be completely refuted by contemporary documents. But only one of the Twelve,
Orson Hyde, recorded that meeting at the time. If proper records had been kept, they would have refuted
any possible claim that Joseph did not want the President of the Twelve to succeed him.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">His third anxiety was a concern to teach in summary all that had theretofore been made known and to
make sure that the brethren understood it. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To that end he spent much of every day for three months with the Twelve and other Church leaders, and
also often in counsel with husbands and wives, sharing, summarizing, reiterating restored truth and
ordinances. <i>&#8220;You give us no rest,&#8221; </i>Orson Pratt said. <i>&#8220;The Spirit urges me,&#8221; 
		</i>the Prophet replied. Wilford
Woodruff said: <i>&#8220;It was not merely a few hours . . . but he spent day after day, week after week, and
month after month, teaching </i>[the Twelve]<i> and a few others the things of the kingdom of God.&#8221; 
		</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As the record shows, even though the temple was not complete he administered the higher ordinances of
the temple to certain of the more faithful. Thus we know of sixty to seventy couples who received
temple blessings in the upper room over his store, before the Nauvoo Temple was completed. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To summarize thus far: temple anxiety, record anxiety, teaching anxiety.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Finally, the fourth anxiety was the Prophet&#8217;s major concern-that the Saints understand his role and be
willing to do what in an extremity they might be required to do. Strangely, throughout the days of the
last of May and early June 1844 many who were associated with the Prophet exhibited unusual
optimism. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Among these was his brother Hyrum, who seemed to feel, even down to the time that they were in jail in
Carthage, that everything would work out. In radical contrast the Prophet had for some time had all
kinds of ominous presentiments.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now we reach the crisis moment, the tinder box and the trigger. In the Nauvoo period some people&#8217;s
attitudes were bitter. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">They joined in league with the underworld. At this time Nauvoo was the largest city in Illinois, hence
counterfeiters, bootleggers, slave traders, gamblers, and every other disreputable type of person found
their way there, trying to exploit the possibilities for dishonest profits, trying to gull recent and
sometimes naive converts. As you walked the streets of Nauvoo it was difficult to know who were the
Saints and who weren&#8217;t. Because of that underworld, but worse still because of apostates living there
who now hated the Church, the Prophet&#8217;s life was placed in jeopardy.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">William Law had first wept at the Prophet&#8217;s announcement of the principle of plural marriage, and with
his arms around Joseph&#8217;s neck had pleaded that he not teach it.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">His son Richard, who said this took place about 1842 and who was present at the time, later related the
incident to Joseph W. McMurrin, who summarized his remarks as follows: </span>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>William Law, with his arms around the neck of the Prophet, was pleading with him to
withdraw the doctrine of plural marriage. Mr. Law predicting that if Joseph would
abandon the doctrine, &#8216;Mormonism&#8217; would, in fifty or one hundred years, dominate the
Christian world. </i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Mr. Law pleaded for this . . . with tears streaming from his eyes. The Prophet was also in
tears, but he informed the gentleman that he could not withdraw the doctrine, for God
had commanded him to teach it, and condemnation would come upon him if he was not
obedient to the commandment. </i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Over that William Law became bitter, and soon he was excommunicated. Then Law attempted to
organize his own church and began to fight back. He and his brother, Wilson, Chauncey and Francis
Higbee, and Robert and Charles Foster were the sextet responsible for the publication on June 7, 1844,
of the first and only issue of the <i>Nauvoo Expositor</i>.</span><br /></font>
</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Written in the most intemperate language, the Expositor vilified the Prophet and attacked the Nauvoo
Charter, which had been a protection to the Saints that they had not had in Missouri. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some examples are: &#8220;How shall he, who has drunk of the poisonous draft, teach virtue? . . . We are
earnestly seeking to explode the vicious principles of Joseph Smith and those who practice the same
abominations and whoredoms.&#8221; Joseph Smith is &#8220;one of the blackest and basest scoundrels that has
appeared upon the stage of human existence since the days of Nero and Caligula,&#8221; and his followers are
&#8220;heaven-daring, Hell-deserving, God-forsaken villains.&#8221; The paper attacked the &#8220;pretended&#8221; authority of
the Nauvoo Charter as &#8220;unjust, illegal, and unconstitutional.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Concern at this threat to their liberties and their lives, the citizens were filled with indignation. The city
council met. According to their understanding of Law, they decided that the Expositor was, by their own
charter, a public nuisance, and that they had the authority not only to confiscate any remaining copies of
the paper but also to destroy the press.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But both friends and enemies of the Prophet now agree that the act, legal or not, was unwise and
inflammatory and was the major immediate factor that culminated in the Prophet&#8217;s death. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">George Laub recorded the following:<i> &#8220;Brother Joseph called a meeting at his own house and told us
that God showed to him in an open vision in daylight that if he did not destroy that printing press that it
would cause the blood of the Saints to flow in the streets and by this was that evil destroyed.&#8221; 
		</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Speaking of those who had returned to report that they had destroyed the press and other materials, as
ordered by the city council, Joseph recorded: <i>&#8220;I . . . told them they had done the right and that not a hair
of their heads should be hurt for it. No doubt, not all believed this. He did not add then, which he could
have, that although he had by that act preserved the Saints&#8217; lives for a time, he had done so at the cost
of his own.&#8221;</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Francis Higbee is said to have remarked on June10 while the city council was in session:
		<i>&#8220;If they lay
their hands upon it </i>[the printing press] <i>or break it, they may date their downfall from that very hour, and
in ten days, there will not be a Mormon left in Nauvoo.&#8221; </i>They threatened much more than they ever did.
Among their threats were that there wouldn&#8217;t be a stone left on the temple, that they would burn all of
Nauvoo, that there would not be one Smith left in the state, and the Mormons would be killed or driven.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This was indeed the crisis. Tried on charges rising out of the Expositor case, the Prophet was twice
acquitted, as were those charged with him. Because Joseph had avoided a hearing in Carthage, where his
life would be forfeit, his enemies were not satisfied. Eventually Thomas Ford, the governor of Illinois,
pronounced himself unsatisfied with those legal procedures and insisted that the Prophet go to be tried
in the very hotbed of the cruelest opposition in the state, Carthage, to placate the masses.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But after they had surrendered themselves at Carthage, the governor pledging to protect them, Joseph
and Hyrum were charged with treason, and bail was set for Joseph and Hyrum and the thirteen other
defendants at $7,500, for which the fifteen men plus several other brethren were able to give surety.
When their enemies thus found they could not get them in jail legally, they found another way, and the
Smith brothers were illegally put in jail.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Many were saying as they had in Kirtland and before, that here was a fallen prophet. Occasionally, with
a twinge of humor, he would say,<i> &#8220;Well, I had rather be a fallen true prophet than a false prophet.&#8221; 
		</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the conspiracy to take his life in which the Laws were involved, two young men had been invited to
the secret meetings &#8211; Dennison L. Harris and Robert Scott. They consulted with the Prophet. He asked
them to go and observe.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">At the risk of their lives they attended these meetings and reported back what they had heard. Prior to
the last meeting they reported their expectation that at that meeting everyone present would be asked to
come forward and take an oath to be willing to take the life of Joseph Smith. The Prophet wept. 
		</span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now he knew by natural means as well as by his presentiments what was happening. The young men
heroically attended the meeting as he suggested, and narrowly escaped with their lives when they were
put under pressure to take the oath.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He gave the last of his discourses in the Grove. Though the rain at the end shortened his talk, he
delivered a masterful discourse on the testimony he had borne from the beginning that the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate Personages. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the final moment of his discourse he said, 
		<i>&#8220;Brethren and sisters, love one another; love one another
and be merciful to your enemies.&#8221; </i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#160;</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Then came the moment, the discourse before the Legion. Some of our historians have candidly observed
that this was Joseph Smith as a man; this wasn&#8217;t really the Prophet, it was humanity coming out. He
stood<i> &#8220;on top of the frame of a building,&#8221;</i> the frame of the unfinished Nauvoo House. Before the group,
many of them in uniform, he said, as he had twice before, that now the moment had been reached when
		<i>&#8220;I will never tamely submit to the dominion of cursed mobocracy.&#8221;
		</i>He summarized how he had been
driven as a roe on the mountains all his life, that his enemies had given him no rest. When they took
away his own rights, he said, he would submit. When they took away the rights of Saints, he would fight
for them. Now he unsheathed his sword and said,<i> &#8220;I call God and angels to witness 
		</i>[what I have said].&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He did cry out at one point, &#8220;<i>Will you stand by me to the death?&#8221; And thousands shouted &#8220;Aye!&#8221; 
		</i>He
responded, <i>&#8220;It is well.&#8221; </i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Then in a wave of assurance of his own soul he said, 
		<i>&#8216;This people shall have their legal rights, and be
protected from mob violence, or my blood shall be spilt upon the ground like water,&#8221; 
		</i>And again, <i>&#8220;I am
willing to sacrifice my life for your preservation.&#8221;</i></span><br /></font>
</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we can understand what was inside of him in love for his brethren, we will understand why his soul
was wounded to the core when men came across the river at Montrose and accused him of cowardice
and said that, despite his words about standing up for them, now that trouble had come he was the first
one to run. That&#8217;s when he replied, <i>&#8220;If my life is of no value to my friends it is of none to myself.&#8221; 
		</i>That
was when the resolve was made to return. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After all that the Saints had received from Joseph, there were some who at that stage could not believe
him when he said, <i>&#8220;All they want is Hyrum and myself . . . They will come here and search for us. Let
them search; they will not harm you . . . not even a hair of your head. We will cross the river tonight,
and go away to the West.&#8221; </i>But the pot was boiling. Reports were coming in every hour telling of
increasing numbers of men who had come from Missouri to join the Illinois mobs; the mobs that were
being gathered and the threats they were making. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the midst of that flood of evidence, Joseph&#8217;s statement, 
		<i>&#8220;You will be safe,&#8221; </i>could not be believed.
More than a hundred, Vilate Kimball wrote, had left Nauvoo. </span><br /></font>
</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Seeing them go, the Prophet said,<i> &#8220;Look at the cowards.&#8221; 
		</i>Now he himself was called a coward. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Porter Rockwell, when asked what he thought should be done, replied to the Prophet in a nineteenth
century phrase, &#8220;<i>As you make your bed, I will lie with you.&#8221; </i>Said Joseph, 
		<i>&#8220;Hyrum, you are the oldest,
what shall we do?&#8221; </i>Hyrum answered, <i>&#8220;Let us go back and give ourselves up.&#8221; 
		</i>The Prophet, probably
thinking of the governor&#8217;s stern, uncompromising letter, said, <i>&#8220;If you go back I will go with you, but we
shall be butchered.&#8221; &#8220;No, no,&#8221; </i>said Hyrum, <i>&#8220;let us go back and put our trust in God, and we shall not
be harmed.&#8221;</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">John Murdock, who watched them row back across the river that day, later said that he felt something in
the air; that there was something threatening about this situation. Hyrum&#8217;s son, Joseph, felt it, and could
never quite speak of it for the rest of his life without weeping. The Prophet would later write a letter to
Emma from the jail. It said in part: <i>&#8220;It is the duty of all men to protect their lives and the lives of the
household, whenever necessity requires.&#8221; </i>He wrote, <i>&#8220;Should the last extreme arrive,&#8221; 
		</i>and then didn&#8217;t
finish the sentence.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Having recrossed the river to Nauvoo that last Sunday, June 3, Joseph sent a letter to the governor in
Carthage promising to be there the next day. After the two brothers returned to surrender state arms as
ordered by the governor, Leonora Taylor was in the Smith home when the Prophet went again to say
goodbye. And as he turned away, he said<i> &#8220;Well, if they don&#8217;t hang me I don&#8217;t care how they kill me.&#8221;</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It seemed likely that Willard Richards overheard that statement and that that is why, in the last
moments, he offered &#8211; and he meant it &#8211; to be hanged in the Prophet&#8217;s stead. The Prophet&#8217;s statement
also tells us that he hadn&#8217;t yet been made to know exactly how he would die. There had been threats,
one of them published in the newspaper, that his enemies would, as the letter said, 
		<i>&#8220;make catfish meat of
him.&#8221; </i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There was also the problem of a reward offered by the Missourians. They had placed a price on his head
&#8211; they would pay a thousand dollars for his delivery. So he did not know how he would end his life, but
he did not relish the thought of hanging.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Mary Ellen Kimball overheard the Prophet say, as the group stopped to ask for a drink of water on the
way to Carthage that morning,<i> &#8220;Brother Rosenkranz, if I never see you again, or if I never come back,
remember that I love you.&#8221; </i>She felt that to her soul, and fled and wept on her bed.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And then there was the pause the group made at the temple, where the Prophet lovingly surveyed that
building, the city, the landscape, and then said;<i> &#8220;This is the loveliest place and the best people under the
heavens; little do they know the trials that await them.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When they were several miles out from Nauvoo he instructed &#8211; and that&#8217;s the only way he could get
them to do so &#8211; that many who had ridden that far with him turn around and go back. John Butler
recorded: </span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>We were all willing to live or die with him. Brother Joseph spoke to us all and told us
that he was like a lamb led to the slaughter. He also spoke to Brother Hyrum and wished
him to return home with us. </i></span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>We begged him to let us stay with him and die with him, if necessary, but he said, no, we
were to return to our home, and Brother Hyrum said that he would stay with Brother
Joseph. He blessed us and told us to go. We bade them farewell, and started. We had
twenty miles to ride, and we went the whole distance with out uttering one word.

feelings at that time, for they over powered me.</i></span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>As I turned and as we rode away I felt as I suppose the ancient disciples of Christ felt
when he said, &#8216;I must be crucified.</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">They also stopped at the Fellows&#8217; farm after being met by a menacing group on horseback from
Carthage, and Joseph went in and countersigned Governor Ford&#8217;s order for the surrender of all state
arms in possession of the Nauvoo Legion.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8220;I am not afraid to die,&#8221; 
		</i>he said, In the jail the day before his death he said to his brethren<i>; &#8220;I have had
a good deal of anxiety about my safety since I left Nauvoo, which I never had before when I was under
arrest. I could not help those feelings and they have depressed me.&#8221;</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Once Joseph and Hyrum had been jailed, many legal efforts were made in their behalf. None of these
availed. Dan Jones went and personally talked to the governor, reporting the threats to the Prophet&#8217;s life
that he had heard uttered in various groups of men now in Carthage. The governor merely said, 
		<i>&#8220;You
are unnecessarily alarmed for the safety of your friends, sir, the people are not that cruel.&#8221; 
		</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A non-Mormon, Dr. Southwick, claimed that only two days before this a meeting was held that included
a representative of every one of the United States. The subject was the political campaign; for Joseph
Smith and Sidney Rigdon had been named respectively as candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency of the United States. Joseph did not, of course, expect to be elected. But now enough support
was being generated, and was showing up in the Eastern newspapers, that men in the meeting meant to
stop the political career of Joseph Smith. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Missourians present said, in effect, 
		<i>&#8220;If you want us to do the job, we&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; </i>And the others said,
		<i>&#8220;If Illinois and Missouri would join together and kill him, they would not be brought to justice for it. If
you don&#8217;t stop him this time, if he isn&#8217;t elected this time, he will, or likely may, next time. 
		</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The governor was surrounded by mobocrats, and the Saints&#8217; efforts with him failed. John Taylor, a man
of great character and spine, saw the situation, was indignant, and said, <i>&#8220;Brother Joseph, if you will
permit it, and say the word, I will have you out of this prison in five hours, if the jail has to come down
to do it.&#8221; </i>He planned to go to Nauvoo and raise a sufficient force. But 
		<i>&#8220;Brother Joseph refused.&#8221; </i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Stephen Markham offered to change clothes with the Prophet, to make a switch &#8211; the Prophet could then
get away on his horse all would be well. The Prophet turned that down. James W. Wood was assigned to
go to Jesse Thomas, one of the circuit judges in Illinois, who had assured the Prophet that if he would
send responsible Mormons to each community and explain the actions of recent days the citizens would
be pacified. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He found that hope too, to be false, for Judge Thomas and others said, in his presence, 
		<i>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
it&#8217;s better for two or more men to die than for a whole neighborhood to be in an uproar?&#8221; 
		</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After all these efforts, the only real thing the Prophet had between him and the final scene was a pistol
which Cyrus Wheelock had brought him. When Hyrum said, <i>&#8220;I hate to use such things or to see them
used,&#8221; </i>the Prophet replied,<i> &#8220;So do I, but we may have to, to defend ourselves.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The background, in a word, is that the Prophet had promised those brethren in the name of the Lord that
he would defend them even if it meant giving up his life. Had he been all alone in the Carthage Jail, the
story might be different, but he was not. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He was there with two members of the Twelve, John Taylor and Willard Richards &#8211; Willard Richards
weighing over three hundred pounds, the largest target (and the only one who would not be injured) &#8211;
and with his brother Hyrum. He did defend them as he had promised. In fact, we now know from the
records that the first man up the stairs that day, anxious and eager, was met by a fist and rolled back
down. That fist was Joseph Smith&#8217;s.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Inside the room they had nothing to defend themselves with except two pistols, plus two walking sticks
which they used in an effort to divert the rifles. Some of the balls went off in the ceiling. When Jacob
Hablin and James W. Woods visited the room shortly after the martyrdom they counted the pockmarks
of the balls that were shot through the door or doorway. There were thirty-six. According to Willard
Richards, all that shooting occurred in less than two minutes. Both Hyrum and Joseph received five
balls; John Taylor, four. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The previous night, the Prophet had had some private conversations. We know that he had borne to the
guards his testimony of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration, and later his last testimony to the
brethren present. We know also that earlier he had pleaded three times with Hyrum for Hyrum to leave
him and go back. Hyrum could only say, <i>&#8220;Joseph, I can&#8217;t leave you.&#8221; 
		</i>Hyrum, it turns out was the first
to be killed.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How did the Prophet make the decision to leave that room, or to try to leave it, through the window?
Films depict Joseph falling off balance out through a large glass plate window. This was a jail. Even the
upstairs had walls as thick as two feet. The window was small, and Joseph was a large man, and for him
to get through it required considerable effort. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Willard Richards used the strangest adverb in his whole account when he said that after emptying the
pistol (which misfired a couple of times) the Prophet turned from the door, dropped the pistol, and went
to the window.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is difficult to understand how anybody could have heard the words in such a fracas, but one man,
outside the jail, claimed he heard the Prophet cry,<i> &#8220;Oh Lord, what shall I do?&#8221;</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How fast can a man&#8217;s mind work in such circumstances? What was going through his? It was certain
death at the door, that was clear. It was certain death at the window, because balls were coming through
it, and John Taylor had just been blasted under the bed, writhing in pain with four wounds. Yet Joseph
decided to get out &#8211; hoping, Willard Richards believed, that it might save the lives of his brethren.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Whether that was his intent or not, he was hit from behind &#8211; twice, maybe three times &#8211; but managed
anyway to pull himself up and out, and then &#8211; from the window.<i> &#8220;He&#8217;s leaped the window!&#8221; 
		</i>someone
shouted, and those on the landing rushed downstairs and outside.<i> &#8220;Shoot him, &#8211; shoot him!&#8221; 
		</i>said Levi
Williams, and they shot several times more. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One account says that the Prophet died with a smile. Perhaps he was conscious long enough to know
that the promise he had made to Willard Richards had been fulfilled: <i>&#8220;Willard . . . you will stand where
the balls will fly around you like hail and men will fall dead by your side, and . . . there never shall a
ball injure you.&#8221; </i>Perhaps he knew that John Taylor would become the third prophet, seer, and revelator.
Elder Taylor would live long enough to write a hymn, <i>&#8220;Oh, Give Me Back My Prophet Dear.&#8221; 
		</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We return to the prophetic words of that last hymn, &#8220;A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.&#8221; It was, in the late
days of Nauvoo, the Prophet&#8217;s favorite, and it was the last music he heard on earth. 
		<i>(Hymn sung by
Professor Ron Anderson and his son Jaxon). </i>The final two lines are: <i>&#8220;These deeds shall thy memorial
be; Fear not, thou didst them unto me&#8221; </i>(p-29).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">For a time the Saints could not be comforted. The mourning and the depression that descended upon
Nauvoo was overwhelming. When Mary Fielding Smith, Hyrum&#8217;s wife, after midnight heard the high-pitched voice of Porter Rockwell, riding on a sweaty horse, shouting, 
		<i>&#8220;They&#8217;ve killed them! They&#8217;ve
killed Joseph and Hyrum!&#8217; </i>she screamed. And young Joseph wept. </span>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Soon all Nauvoo knew. Some felt bitter and wanted vengeance. Some who held command positions in
the Nauvoo Legion went immediately and asked that they be marshaled. But the leaders had been told
by the Prophet to stay home. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Many of the brethren absent on missions felt forebodings that day, even at the hour of the martyrdom.
Only seven days previously the Prophet had sent letters to all the Twelve asking them to return to
Nauvoo immediately. So it was that the returning Parley P. Pratt walking depressed across the plains of
Illinois until he could hardly endure it. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Finally he knelt and prayed for comfort; and then it was made known to him that the newspaper
headline he has seen in Chicago told the truth, that Joseph and Hyrum had in fact given their lives for
the Lord&#8217;s cause, and that he was to go back rapidly to Nauvoo and tell the Saints to do nothing until the
Twelve had reassembled.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8220;Blessed are ye,&#8221; 
		</i>said the Lord to the Prophet early on, <i>&#8220;even if they do unto you even as they have
done unto me, . . . for you shall dwell with me in glory.&#8221; </i>In 1843 the Prophet recorded the Lord&#8217;s words
addressed to him: <i>&#8220;I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my
Father, with Abraham your father.&#8221; </i><span>&#160;</span></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In that same revelation the Lord said: 
		<i>&#8220;Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph . . . for he shall
do the sacrifice which I require at his hands&#8221; </i>(My Nauvoo Temple Experience).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Like many of the prophets of ancient times, the prophet of the last dispensation was martyred for the
Lord&#8217;s cause. <i>&#8220;Many have marveled because of his death,&#8221; 
		</i>the Lord told Brigham Young, <i>&#8220;but it was
needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and the wicked might
be condemned.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thanks to President Kim Clark and his 		wife, and all of the staff for their hospitality here at BYUIdaho. It 		is a great honor for Sister Rasband and I to be assigned here.<br /> <br />		I love my wifemy eternal companion. I am grateful for her remarks here 		today. She is a remarkable companion to me on our journey through life. 		She has a great love for you young people as you can tell.<br /> <br />		It is a real privilege of being able to speak here at BYUIdaho. We have 		a special love for you students. My wife and I met as students at the 		University of Utah. We lived in married-student housing, and years later 		went back to the University as a bishop in a student ward. Our five 		children have all attended BYUProvo. Three of them have graduated and 		one is still attending. <br />		It seems that our lives have been closely connected to students and 		young married couples. <br /> <br />		When we served as mission president and companion in New York City, we 		recommended many of our returned missionaries to BYUIdaho, then Ricks 		College. A few of them, and others we know, are here today. We offer a 		special welcome to all of our friends and associates. <br /> <br />		Now in my current assignment, I labor in love concerning Young Single 		Adults, and young marrieds in my areas of supervision, especially in 		California north to Alaska. You are very much on the minds and in the 		prayers of the Brethren. We know of the intense pressure that is on you 		from all aspects of life. Remember, the Senior Brethren have children 		and grandchildren that have very personal connections to your stage of 		life.<br /> <br />		Our youngest son has recently returned from serving in the Russia Moscow 		South Mission. Part of his mission (a year) was spent in a country that 		full-time missionaries had never been to before. Kazakstanin the city 		of Almaty. This city is near the border of China.<br /> <br />		Shortly after he arrived there, a report came from my fellow Seventy, 		Elder Dennis Neuenschwander, Area President, who said he had visited 		Almatyand gave the missionaries their first copy of Preach My Gospel. 		He wrote to me and said it had been delivered to the uttermost corner of 		the earth. I thought of the 58th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 		verse 64. For, verily, the sound must go forth from this place into all 		the world, and unto the uttermost parts of the earththe gospel must be 		preached unto every creature, with signs following them that believe.		<br /> <br />		Two years ago our family returned from serving in the Area Presidency in 		the Europe Central Area in Frankfurt Germany where we had sixteen 		missions to supervise. We were so pleased to tour, visit them, and 		actually see how the important new focus of teaching by the Spirit was 		going. It has been so thrilling to see the progress that is being made 		in the missions now that Preach My Gospel is in every mission, and now 		in your bookstore and Church Distribution Centers. I know some of you 		are very familiar with this new missionary tool. As returned 		missionaries, prospective missionaries, and as members of the Church, 		there is much to be learned from this book.<br /> <br />		Preach My Gospel is taken from Doctrine and Covenants Section 50, 		verses 13-14, when the Lord asks this important question:<br /> <br />		Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this questionunto what were ye ordained?<br /> <br />		To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the comforter which was sent 		forth to teach the truth.<br /> <br />		The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have been inspired to 		raise the bar for not just missionaries, but really for all of us. The 		entire Church is striving to rely more on the promptings of the Holy 		Ghost.<br /> <br />		Certainly as students, your lives can be and must be directed by the 		Holy Ghost. Your daily academic pursuits, including studies and testing, 		social interactions, religious education, and your very life where your 		temporal and spiritual requirements are inseparable and need to be 		Spirit-influenced. <br /> <br />		This afternoon I would like to speak about a subject more basic than 		being guided by the Spirit, but critically linked to it. That is how you 		each must be living and prepared to enjoy the companionship of the Holy 		Ghost in the first place.<br /> <br />		Through confirmation and by the laying on of hands, you have already 		been given the gift of the Holy Ghost. As it states in the Doctrine and 		Covenants, Section 39:23, And again, it shall come to pass that on as 		many as ye shall baptize with water, ye shall lay your hands, and they 		shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost<br /> <br />		This will be a great privilege for you throughout your lives to have 		this special gift from the Lord.<br /> <br />		Enjoying the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost is quite a 		different matterand a goal for all of us to try and achieve.<br /> <br />		Anger, disunity, contention, lying, and impurity of thoughts and deeds 		to name a few vices, chase away the holy presence of this Third Member 		of the Godhead. Such unaltered and unrepentant behavior causes 		Latter-day Saints to lose the Spirit, and lose confidence. <br /> <br />		Let us take improper thoughts, even immoral thoughts as an example. From 		the Doctrine and Covenants Section 63:16 we read, And verily I say unto 		you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a woman to lust after 		her, or if any shall commit adultery in their hearts, they shall not 		have the Spirit <br /> <br />		We know how not having the Spirit impacts teaching the gospel. For 		example: From Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 we read, And the Spirit 		shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not 		the Spirit ye shall not teach. No Spiritno teach!<br /> <br />		I would offer you a little formula today that you can remember easily, 		that through my experience as a father, student-ward bishop, mission 		president, and General Authority, almost certainly will enable you to 		have the Spirit as your constant companion.<br /> <br />		FIRST, bridle your passions. Let us look at Almas teachings to his son, 		Shiblom, who was beginning his mission. In Alma 38:10-12, we read:<br /> <br />		And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye 		should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and 		temperate in all things.<br /> <br />		See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast 		in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.<br /> <br />		Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your 		passions that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from 		idleness (Alma 38:10-12).<br /> <br />		I would like to focus on the word BRIDLE. Every Idaho farm boy or girl 		sitting here today knows what this is. <br /> <br />		To bridle our passions is a remarkable caution the Lord gave the Prophet 		Alma in the Book of Mormon. A wild horse needs to be broke or trained 		to succumb to the will of its master. A bridle or harness is used for 		this purpose. It is also used thereafter to guide and restrain the 		animal. Similarly, our natural passions need to be broken so that we can 		likewise follow the will of our Master, even the Lord Jesus Christ. 		Passions, like wild horses, need to be bridled and restrained as we 		strive to be obedient and follow the Lords teachings.<br /> <br />		In a worldly environment such as we live, and which you now face as 		students, which could suggest one can have everything now, bridling our 		passions in terms of our physical yearnings is mandatory. You just must 		do it.<br /> <br />		Some examples that you might be facing could be:<br /> <br />		-Staying out to late.<br />		-Living on the edge of the Honor Code.<br />		-Watching inappropriate movies, DVDs, television shows.<br />		-Being obsessed with video, Internet games.<br />		-Playing popular games of chance, like Poker.<br />		-Indulging to any degree with Internet pornography, or magazines. <br /> <br />		All of these are examples of natural man (woman) passions and the 		adversarys temptations that need to be bridled.<br /> <br />		From the Doctrine and Covenants we find and read the SECOND part of the 		formula: Garnish Your Thoughts:<br /> <br />		Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 		household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; 		then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God <br /> <br />		The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion (Doctrine and Covenants 		121:45-46).<br /> <br />		The Lord uses another fascinating phrase here, to let virtue garnish our 		thoughts unceasingly. In other words, to enhance or embellish our 		thoughts with virtue. I think of a common garnishment as an addition to 		a nice plate of food. The garnish adds beauty and delight to the meal, 		just as virtue does to our thoughts.<br /> <br />		So what does it mean for us to garnish our thoughts with virtue? There 		are several helpful references in the scriptures that can be considered, 		for example the Thirteenth Article of Faith: <br /> <br />		We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in 		doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition 		of PaulWe believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many 		things and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything 		virtuous, lovely or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these 		things (Thirteenth Article of Faith).<br /> <br />		Alma taught that in resisting temptation we could draw upon the 		Scriptures to increase our personal virtue and strength:<br /> <br />		And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the 		people to do that which was justyea, it had had more powerful effect 		upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had 		happened unto themtherefore Alma thought it was expedient that they 		should try the virtue of the word of God (Alma 31:5, emphasis added).<br /> <br />		The Book of Mormon challenge President Hinckley recently gave the entire 		Church is a good example of this.<br /> <br />		Paul in writing to the Philippians in the New Testament also advised:<br /> <br />		Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are 		honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, 		whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if 		there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things 		(Philippians 4:8).<br /> <br />		It has been my experience, with thousands of young people, that very 		little occurs in the way of transgression that is not first rehearsed 		and debated in ones own mind and soul. A huge key in avoiding these 		pitfalls is to let virtue be in our thoughts and deeds always, not 		allowing our minds to wander. I can recommend it without reservation as 		a way for you to flee from temptation and transgression. <br /> <br />		As members of the Church, we know how strongly President Gordon B. 		Hinckley feels about this subject. He has written:<br /> <br />		Challenging though it may be, there is a way to apply traditional moral 		principles in our day. For some unknown reason, there is constantly 		appearing the false rationalization that at one time in the long ago, 		virtue was easy and that now it is difficult. I would like to remind any 		who feel that way that there has never been a time since the Creation 		when the same forces were not at work, that are at work today. The 		proposal made by Potiphars wife to Joseph in Egypt is no different from 		that faced by many men and women and youth in our day.<br /> <br />		The influences today may be more apparent and more seductive, but they 		are no more compelling. One cannot be shielded entirely from these 		influences. They are all about us. Our culture is saturated with them. 		But the same kind of self-discipline exercised by Joseph will yield the 		same beneficial result. Notwithstanding the so-called new morality, 		notwithstanding the much-discussed changes in moral standards, there is 		no adequate substitute for virtue. Gods standards may be challenged 		everywhere throughout the world, but God has not abrogated his 		commandments.<br /> <br />		The THIRD part of this formula is we must ask for the Spiritpray for 		it.<br /> <br />		From Doctrine and Covenants, Section 63:64, Remember that that which 		cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by 		constraint of the Spirit; and in this there is no condemnation, and ye 		receive the spirit through prayer <br /> <br />		Ye receive the spirit through prayer. I have seen so many missionaries 		humbly kneeling, sweet appealing for the power of the Spirit. Our Father 		has provided in His Plan of Happiness, a Savior for us, even Christ the 		Lord. Through self-control and repentance, we can each tame the natural 		men and women that we are.<br /> <br />		I invite you today to consider your passions and where necessary, bridle 		them in your life.<br /> <br />		I invite you today to take greater control of your thoughts, garnish 		them with virtue, such as of the beloved Word of God.<br /> <br />		I invite you to humbly and prayerfully plead with the Lord to bless you 		with the Holy Ghost.<br /> <br />		I invite you to go before the Lord and ask him to bless you with 		strength, to be the greatest generation of young people, going into the 		world with power and authority and the Holy Ghost, inviting people of 		all lands to come unto Christ.<br /> <br />		I promise you as a servant of the Lord, that he will bless you with the 		presence and companionship of the Holy Ghost. Bridle your passions, 		garnish your thoughts, and by the prayer of faith you will be led by the 		Spirit and join in this magnificent miracle.</font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000080"><br /></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">If you have guessed from the title of this talk, which is &#8220;The Lord Loveth A Cheerful Giver,&#8221;
that it is a talk about tithing, you are right. When told the topic was tithing, a friend said, &#8220;That&#8217;s
a two word talk &#8211; Pay it.&#8221; He has a point. Why am I expanding on that? Several events that occur
at this stage in a Latter-Day Saint student&#8217;s life make this a timely topic:</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">First, your income has or before long will show a major increase when you finish your education
and the series of part time jobs that helped to pay for your schooling and start into full time
employment.<br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, qualifying for a temple recommend and receiving your endowment prior to serving a
mission or marrying in the temple will require that you be a full tithe payer. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Third, in choosing a spouse and planning how to deal with your combined resources, it would be
wise before marriage to have discussed with the person you are considering marrying what his or
her attitude is about the payment of tithing. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fourth, if you are already married, you are seeing more clearly than before the affect a decision
to pay, or not to pay, tithing is having in your life. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fifth, as you start a family, your children will primarily look to you for training and example in
spiritual matters. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Therefore, the following is intended to give you some things to think about as you deal with this
doctrine that is about to play an ever increasing role in your life. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Before the world was, the Lord said as reported in Abraham 3:24-25:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>&#8230;</i> [W]<i>e</i> <i>will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials,
and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;&#8217;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>And we will prove them herewith</i></span><i>, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the
Lord their God shall command them;</i> (emphasis added). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Subsequently, the world was formed and peopled, and not long thereafter, relatively speaking,
the doctrine of tithing was known. Tithing was, and is, one of the ways the Lord&#8217;s people prove
themselves.<br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">We know that tithing was a concept which was practiced in the Old Testament. Tithing was part
of the Levitical law. Leviticus 27:30 provides, <i>&#8220;And all the tithe of the land, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">whether</span> of the seed
of the land, <span style="font-weight: bold">or</span> of the fruit of the tree, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> the LORD&#8217;s;
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<span style="font-weight: bold">it is </span>holy unto the LORD</span>&#8221;</i> (emphasis
added). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the 14<sup>th</sup> chapter of Genesis verse 20, Abram was met by Melchizedek, King of Salem.
Melchizedek blessed Abram, and Abram gave Melchizedek<i> &#8220;tithes of all.&#8221;</i><span>&#160;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">So significant was Abraham&#8217;s payment of tithing to Melchizedek apparently thought to be that,
as just mentioned, it is discussed in the Old Testament in Genesis 14:18-20, in the New
Testament in Hebrews 7:2 and in the Book of Mormon in Alma 13:15. However, later, Malachi,
seeing in his time the reduction in commitment of Israel to the law of tithing, recorded the words
of the Lord with which we are so familiar, saying:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and
have not kept <span style="font-weight: bold">them.</span> Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of
hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed
thee? In tithes and offerings.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>

<font color="#000080">Tithing was taught in the Book of Mormon. For example, the Lord deemed what had been said
about tithing in Malachi to be so important that He commanded that statements in Malachi,
including those on tithing, be written by His disciples in the new world. Then He personally
taught such matters commencing in 3 Nephi 24:1: <i>&#8220;And it came to pass that he commanded them
that they should write the words which the Father had given unto Malachi, which he should tell
unto them. And it came to pass that after they were written he expounded them.&#8221;</i><br />

Malachi. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the Old Testament, Jacob had been aware of tithing. In Genesis 28:20-22, Jacob vowed a vow
saying:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
eat, and raiment to put on, </i></font></p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold">for</span> a pillar, shall be God&#8217;s house: and of all that thou
shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee </i>(emphasis added).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Jacob sounds as though he was bargaining with the Lord: if the Lord delivers what Jacob wants,
then Jacob will pay a tithe and believe. This sounds like faith following the miracle, not
preceding it. Similarly, in the latter-days, when little knowledge about tithing had yet been given
to Joseph Smith, this same conditional approach to paying tithing occurred. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Joseph Smith presumably became acquainted with tithing through his Bible study and then
became further acquainted with that principle from his translating of the Book of Mormon.
Along with much else, presumably the passages just mentioned were impressed upon him. In
1834, before he had received much specific personal divine guidance relating to tithing he relates
the following:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>On the evening of the 29<sup>th</sup> of November, I united in prayer with Brother Oliver for
the continuance of blessings. After giving thanks for the relief which the Lord had
lately sent us by opening the hearts of the brethren from the east, to loan us $430;
after commencing and rejoicing before the Lord on this occasion, we agreed to
enter into the following covenant with the Lord, viz. [namely]: </i></font></p>

shall command; and that we will be faithful over that which He has entrusted to

<p><font color="#000080">As I mentioned previously, this was before tithing, as we know it today, had been given as a
commandment to the Church. It is interesting that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery wrote down
their commitment <i>&#8220;to give a tenth to be bestowed upon the poor&#8221;</i> conditioned on the Lord
prospering them and opening the way before them that they might obtain the means to pay their
debts. Also interesting is the fact that it was written. They did that <i>&#8220;&#8230;so our children after us
will remember to observe this sacred and holy covenant; and that our children, and our
children&#8217;s children, may know of the same.&#8221; </i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Here, as with Jacob, when tithing was not well understood, they in effect bargained with the
Lord to pay after the blessings were received. Four years later, the Prophet Joseph&#8217;s
understanding of tithing was clarified by a revelation from the Lord, which revelation is
contained in section 119 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The italicized head note to section 119
gives a helpful explanation of the background for this revelation and reads as follows:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<font color="#000080"><i>Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July
8, 1838, in answer to his supplication: &#8216;O Lord, show unto thy servants how much
thou requirest of the properties of they people for a tithing.&#8217; HC 3:44. The law of
tithing, as understood today, had not been given to the Church previous to this
revelation. The term &#8216;tithing&#8217; in the prayer just quoted and in previous revelations
		</i>(64: 23; 85: 3; 97: 11)<i> had meant not just one-tenth, but all freewill offerings, or
contributions, to the Church funds. The Lord had previously given to the Church
the law of consecration and stewardship of property, which members (chiefly the
leading elders) entered into by a covenant that was to be everlasting. Because of
failure on the part of many to abide by this covenant, the Lord withdrew it for a
time, and gave instead the law of tithing to the whole Church. The Prophet asked
the Lord how much of their property he required for sacred purposes. The answer
was this revelation. </i></font></p>

is actually set forth in one verse of section 119 of the Doctrine and Covenants.
That fourth verse consists of thirty-five words. Contrast that with the cumbersome
and complex tax codes enacted and enforced by the governments. In the one case
it is a brief statement from the Lord, the payment left to the individual and
motivated by faith. With the other it is a tangled web created by men and enforced

faithful members of my Church, it is my will, saith the Lord, that each one shall
receive from my storehouse, the storehouse of my Church, at regular intervals

<font color="#000080"><i>Definition of Tithing: The First Presidency has written: &#8220;The simplest statement
we know of is the statement of the Lord himself, namely, that the members of the
Church should pay &#8216;one-tenth of all their interest annually,&#8217; which is understood
to mean income. No one is justified in making any other statement than this&#8221;</i>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Often there is an attempt by members at further refinement or definition of the meaning of the
words <i>&#8220;interest annually.&#8221; </i>When we try to elaborate on that subject, I am reminded of a well-read gospel doctrine teacher I heard say in teaching a lesson, &#8220;I am now going to make plain
what the Lord only touched on lightly.&#8221; The presumptuousness of that is apparent. The First
Presidency established the principle. We don&#8217;t need to refine or define further. It has been said,<i>
&#8220;Establish the principle and the exception is between the member and the Lord.&#8221;</i> Similarly, in
regard to tithing, we might say, <i>&#8220;Establish the principle and the implementation is between the
tithe payer and the Lord.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How important is it to be an honest tithe payer? Lorenzo Snow said:<i> &#8220;&#8230;</i>[P]<i>art of a tithing is no

		<i>&#8220;I know not, save the
Lord commanded me&#8221; </i>(Moses 5:6). Going back to the beginning of the world and the beginning
of these remarks &#8211; we were sent here to prove ourselves and see if we, <i>&#8220;&#8230;will do all things

<p>
<font color="#000080">Beyond the requirement aspect of tithing, Matthew Cowley speaking about why to pay tithing,
during a talk in the Northwest, said:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>President Stratford, here, for instance could say to me, &#8216;Brother Cowley, we will
go into business together. I&#8217;ll furnish all the capital, all the blessings, all the
resources. You look after the business. Call upon me when you need me for any
advice. I&#8217;ll be around. I&#8217;ll be available if you need me. If you have any
difficulties, call on me. Then when the profits come in, you keep ninety percent
and give me ten, and then I&#8217;ll put my ten percent right back into the business.
How would you like that?&#8217; My, I would like to have him for a partner on that
basis. Well, that&#8217;s the kind of partner we have, brothers and sisters. The sun, the
rain, the blessings of heaven, the windows are open. My, how they are opened
here in Oregon. The windows of heaven are open, and down it comes. The lands
bear fruit. &#8216;You run the business,&#8217; God said. &#8216;I am there to give you counsel, and
when the increase comes in, you keep ninety percent and give me my ten, and I
will put every penny of it right back into the business.&#8217; That is just exactly what he
does. Every penny of his ten percent comes right back into his business here upon
the earth </i>(Matthew Cowley, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Matthew Cowley Speaks</span>, Deseret Book Company,
sixth printing, Salt Lake City, Utah, (1960), 171).</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">How it comes back is worthy of discussion because it is not limited to a monetary return. While
working with missionaries, I saw that the hope of receipt of immediate tangible monetary
blessings was the principle reason some missionaries were using to convert investigators to the
principle of tithing. They would teach by using examples such as, &#8220;I paid my tithing, and the
next day I found a wallet with the same or a greater sum of money in it,&#8221; or, &#8220;I got a raise,&#8221; or, &#8220;I
received an inheritance,&#8221; etc.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have no doubt that some times this sort of thing happened and happened promptly, but I think it
is neither wise to pay tithing in reliance on that nor do I feel such a tithing accompanied by such
an expectation has involved a sacrifice. The Old Testament prophet David, wanting to buy land
on which to erect an alter to make sacrifices to the Lord would not accept a gift of such land for
the alter nor the gift of the requisite animals for the sacrifices from Araunah saying,
		<i>&#8220;&#8230; </i>[N]<i>ay</i>;
<i>but I will surely buy <span style="font-weight: bold">it </span>of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my
God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for
fifty shekels of silver&#8221;</i> (2 Samuel 24:25, emphasis added).<br /></font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Incidentally, it is interesting to note that this land that David wanted to purchase to evidence a
sacrifice was later the site on which his son, Solomon, built the temple. (See 2 Chronicles 3:1
and footnote thereto.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe the payment of tithing to be a way to prove ourselves. I believe it to be fulfillment of a
commandment and an obligation, whether or not it is accompanied by any recognized blessings.
I believe that by obedience to that commandment we may be blessed in the Lord&#8217;s own way and
on the Lord&#8217;s own time schedule. Having said that, I have a rock solid testimony that blessings
do come, though sometimes not recognized immediately. They come in a multitude of ways, but
I don&#8217;t think tithing should be paid in reliance on that. To do so would make it more analogous
to an investment. As we make a voluntary sacrifice to show our obedience to his commandments
and our love for the Lord and his work, when the blessings do come we recognize again the
source from which they flow.<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">They do not necessarily come immediately like the found wallet or the raise nor do they
necessarily come so immediately identifiable. To realize some of the broad range of ways the
Lord can and has blessed the honest tithe payers, let me give you some testimonials of Latter
Day Prophets:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold">As to temporal blessings:</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord can bless our land. Joseph F. Smith said, 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;</i>[W]<i>e</i> <i>may sanctify, by obedience to His
law </i>[of tithing], <i>this land that it may become indeed a land of Zion unto us;&#8230;&#8221; 
		</i>(Joseph F. Smith,
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Gospel Doctrine</span>, fifth edition, Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, Utah, (1939), 226).
Joseph F. Smith further said, <i>&#8220;&#8230;</i>[H]<i>e</i> <i>will cause that the earth shall be fruitful&#8221;

<p><font color="#000080">As students, you may be especially interested in these two statements of Heber J. Grant, 
		<i>&#8220;I want
to repeat to the Latter-day Saints my firm belief that God our Heavenly Father&#8230;gives wisdom to
those men and to those women who are strictly honest with Him in the payment of their tithing&#8221;
		</i>(Heber J. Grant, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, Oct. 1921, 6). Further, he said, 
		<i>&#8220;I believe that to those who
are liberal </i>[in paying tithing] <i>the Lord gives ideas, and they grow in capacity and ability more
rapidly than those that are stingy&#8221; </i>(Heber J. Grant,

		<i>&#8220;I have
no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.&#8221; </i>J. Reuben Clark said, 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;</i>[T]<i>hereby</i>
[by paying tithing] <i>you will have greater joy than through any other temporal activity in which
you may engage&#8221; </i>( J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,

<p>
<font color="#000080">As parents, take your young children with you to tithing settlement. When two of our children
were in junior high school and the youngest was about two or three years old, as we completed
our interview with the bishop during tithing settlement, he turned to the youngest and said to
him, &#8220;Do you have any tithing you would like to pay?&#8221; Our son reached in his pocket. Since
neither my wife or I had talked to him about being prepared to pay tithing at this time nor did we
know of any income that this two or three year old had, we wondered expectantly what might
come out of his pocket. With great solemnity, he pulled an acorn out and placed it on the
Bishop&#8217;s desk. With equally great solemnity, the Bishop accepted it, placed it with the checks he
had received, spoke briefly about the payment of tithing in kind, filled out a receipt in the tithing
receipt book with our son&#8217;s name and the amount of the contribution, &#8220;one tithing nut.&#8221; It was
signed by the Bishop. Our son&#8217;s face lit up as the Bishop passed the receipt across the desk. On
the way home he asked his brother and sister to read the receipt to him several times and for a
significant period that receipt took an honored place among his cherished belongings. As it did
him, it brought us great joy to see him attempt to make his first tithing offering and &#8220;the tithing
nut&#8221; is part of our family lore. </font></p>

<font color="#000080">As you start your career, you might note Spencer W. Kimball&#8217;s teaching that,<i> &#8220;No one is ever
too poor to pay tithing&#8230;.He can give us better salaries. He can give us more judgment in
spending our money. He can give us better health, he can give us greater understanding so that
we can get better positions&#8221;</i> ( Spencer W. Kimball,

<font color="#000080">Over a lifetime, it builds confidence to remember that Marion G. Romney said, 
		<i>&#8220;I have heard
President J. Reuben Clark, a modern prophet, say over and over again that the Lord would
never let one of His Saints who had been faithful in the payment of tithes and offerings go
without the necessities of life&#8221;</i> (Marion G. Romney, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Look to God and Live</span><i>,</i> Deseret Book Co.,
Salt Lake City, Utah, (1973), 150).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold">As to spiritual blessings:</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Testimonies can be strengthened. Heber J. Grant said, 
		<i>&#8220;If you desire &#8230;the testimony of the
gospel, pay all your obligations to God and you shall have it&#8221; </i>(Heber J. Grant, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference
Report</span>, Oct. 1899, 20). Twenty six years later, he said:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>Prosperity comes to those who observe the law of tithing; and when I say prosperity I am
not thinking of it in terms of dollars and cents alone, &#8230;what I count as real prosperity, as
the one thing of all others that is of great value to every man and woman living, is the
growth in the knowledge of God, and in a testimony, and in the power to live the gospel
and to inspire our families to do the same. That is prosperity of the truest kind 
		</i>(Heber J.
Grant,<i><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, April 1925, 10). 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Heber J. Grant there spoke of the blessings that pass to our family as well. Also, in that regard,
George Q. Cannon indicated that, <i>&#8220;The liberal tithe payer binds himself and his family more
firmly to the Church&#8221; </i>(George Q. Cannon quoted in Jerreld L. Newquist,
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Gospel Truth</span>:
Discourses and Writings of President George Q. Cannon, Deseret Book Company (1974),
2:301). Further, he pointed out that, <i>&#8220;Being thus bound&#8230;they are more likely to withstand
temptation&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ibid</span>).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">We may receive an increase in the Spirit of the Lord said Heber J. Grant, 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230; [I]f the people will
pay their tithes and offerings, they will not only be blessed in their material affairs, but they will
be abundantly blessed by increased outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord&#8221;
		</i>(Heber J. Grant,
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, October 1899, 19). And, Harold B. Lee has explained that being a tithe payer
may increase our likelihood of receiving personal revelation, <i>&#8220;By tithing&#8230;the windows of
heaven would be open and blessings would be poured out that we would hardly be able to
contain. The opening of the windows of heaven, of course, means revelation from God to him
who is willing thus to sacrifice&#8221; </i>(Harold B. Lee, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Teachings of Harold B. Lee</span>, edited by
Clyde J. Williams, Bookcraft, Salt Lake City, Utah, (1996), 206).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Our spiritual power can be increased. David O. McKay taught 
		<i>&#8220;[Tithing] is an unfailing source
of spiritual power. True and constant obedience to this law will give us as much spiritual
development as will obedience to any other principle of the gospel,&#8230;&#8221; 
		</i>(David O. MaKay, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Gospel Ideals</span>, Deseret News Press, Salt Lake City, Utah, (1953), 199).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><i>&#8220;&#8230;</i>[T]<i>ithing</i> <i>teaches those fundamental elements upon which strength of character rests: viz
[namely], self-control, self-denial, generosity, love for fellowmen and love for God&#8221;
		</i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ibid</span>).)<br /></font>
</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our relationship to the Lord becomes more intimate. Howard W. Hunter said in Conference in
April, 1964, <i>&#8220;If we pay our tithes because of our love for the Lord, in complete freedom and
faith, we narrow our distance from [the Lord] and our relationship to Him becomes intimate&#8221;
		</i>(Howard W. Hunter, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, April 1964, 36). 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we pay tithing voluntarily on our own initiative, we feel joy, increased spiritual strength and
personal growth. These come because of our adherence to the unenforceable. I can testify that I
have seen and felt many of those results in my own life and in the lives of our family. May I add
one last reason to pay tithing, <i>&#8220;God loveth a cheerful giver&#8221;</i> (2 Corinthians 9:7).</font></p>

<font color="#000080"><i>And God <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all
sufficiency in all <span style="font-weight: bold">things</span>, may abound to every good work 
		</i>(2 Corinthians 9:6-8,
emphasis added).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me tell you of just two cheerful givers in my experience. First, whenever I think of the
widow&#8217;s mite, it brings to mind an experience in a small branch meeting in a row house on a
street in a large eastern city in which branch my wife and I served for 18 months. It was located
in a very distressed intercity neighborhood that had been burned over during the riots
accompanying the Martin Luther King assassination in 1968. Much of it had not been rebuilt.
The people in the branch paid their tithing in part with coins and in doing so paid an honest tithe.
At one of our meetings, a woman handed me an envelope with the tithing slip and the relevant
bills and coins and then after doing that said to me, &#8220;If you belong to a church, you ought to
contribute. I can&#8217;t contribute much, but I can contribute the sacrament bread,&#8221; and handed me a
baggie with two little pieces of bread in it. As we used her bread for the sacrament, the whole
experience carried an additional meaning that day. Going through my mind continually was the
verse dealing with the widow&#8217;s mite and that she, out of her poverty, had given more than they
all.<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, as a bishop in a large eastern city, a Spanish speaking branch had been merged into our
suburban ward. One of the Hispanic members came to me confused about whether to pay 14%,
17% or more to satisfy his tithing obligations. When I inquired as to why he asked, he explained,
&#8220;In the country I came from, people do not get a deduction from income tax for donations to
charitable institutions. Here you do. When I pay tithing, I get back through reduced taxes a
percentage of what I paid in tithing. Since I am to pay the Lord 10% shouldn&#8217;t I pass on to Him
the amount by which I reduce my taxes by paying tithing?&#8221; I explained to him that the tax law
expresses a public policy to encourage personal charitable giving and that the 10% he was
already paying as tithing was what was requested of the Lord.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I left the tithing settlement with that man and so many others, I was each time reminded of
what a blessed way tithing is to both show our love and devotion to the Lord and to finance His
work. I leave my witness with you that the act of sacrifice alone by paying tithing strengthens
character and integrity which itself justifies the act but that there is so much more both
recognized and unrecognized that comes to us from compliance with this commandment, and I
do it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the doctrines of the Church, faith and the quest for knowledge are not inconsistent, they are
compatible and complimentary. When I speak of faith, I am speaking of faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members have a doctrinal commitment to
education. Studies have indicated that over 50% of Latter-day Saint men and 40% of Latter-day
Saint women have completed four or more years of college. This is among the highest of all
religions. In addition, <i>&#8220;Mormons with college experience have attendance rates notably higher
than any other group&#8221; </i>(Stan L. Albrecht and Tim B. Heaton, &#8220;Secularization, Higher Education,
and Religiosity,&#8221; <i>LDS Social Life Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members</i>, edited

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Faith and knowledge require equal effort and commitment. We cannot expect to have faith at the
center of our lives if all of our efforts are expended on knowledge, making money, sports,
hobbies, or other pursuits.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder LeGrand Richards, then of the Quorum of the Twelve, used to tell the story of a man living
in the southern part of the United States who sold rabbit pies. He had a significant business and
produced a large number of pies. At some point people became suspicious that the pies included
horse meat. A charge was made that he was engaged in false advertising. He initially denied that
the pies contained horse meat, but upon questioning admitted that &#8220;<i>yes there was a little horse
meat.&#8221;</i> Upon further interrogation he finally acknowledged that the pies were half horse and half
rabbit. When asked what he meant by half horse and half rabbit, he said one horse and one
rabbit.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some of us want faith to be at the center of our lives, but it does not get our attention, it is the

2005, pp 100-01), the respected British newspaper magazine, there was a very interesting
economic analysis of attendance at several churches. The economic study and analysis by
Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims, according
to the article that, <i>&#8220;. . . regular religious participation leads to better education, higher income

pointed his finger at us and said: <i>&#8220;Matthew 5:48, do you know that scripture?&#8221;</i> My senior
companion stated, <i>&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8221;</i>
President Boyer said, <i>&#8220;That is correct.&#8221;</i> He then said, <i>&#8220;Elders, are you living that
commandment?&#8221;</i> We started to stammer; we knew we were not perfect! He started to help us. He
asked questions starting three days earlier. He asked when we went to bed, when we got up, did
we have individual and companion scripture study, did we go out proselyting on time? He then
said, <i>&#8220;I am sure you are not perfect, but you have made perfect choices for the last three days
and that means you are moving in the right direction.&#8221;</i> He then left us thinking about the
importance of the questions he had asked.</span><br /></font></p>

was wonderful. He told how it had been his goal to play his favorite sport until his 50<sup>th</sup> birthday.
His wife had agreed with his goal if he met certain family responsibilities. It was interesting to
see all of the sacrifices he was willing to make so he could play his favorite sport until he was
50. He had just turned 50 and was finally retiring from actually playing, but during his
testimony, there was one sad note. He testified that he believed the Book of Mormon was true,

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My brother, Joe, was 20 years old. It was during the Korean conflict and only one young man in
each ward could go on a mission. The others had to be available to be drafted into the military. A
young man in our ward had gone on a mission early in the year; my brother&#8217;s birthday was in
September, so he didn&#8217;t think he would get the opportunity to serve a mission. 
		</span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our stake president called my brother in and told him that one of the wards had not used its
allotment and he might be able to go. Missionaries were called at 20 years of age in those days
and my brother had just filled out his application to apply to medical school. He was a good
student. My father, who was not active in the church, had made financial preparations to help
him with medical school and was disappointed when he learned of the conversation with the
stake president. He counseled him not to go and suggested that he could do more good by going
to medical school.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This was a big issue in our family. That night my brother and I talked about the choice. He was
five years older so it was mainly his thinking. As we reasoned it out, we concluded: If Jesus
Christ was a great man but not divine, if Joseph Smith was a wonderful teacher but not a
prophet, or if the Book of Mormon had wonderful counsel but was not the Word of God, then
dad was right &#8211; it would be better to go to medical school. But, if Jesus Christ is divine, if Joseph
Smith is a prophet, and if the Book of Mormon is the Word of God &#8211; then it would be more
important to accept the call and proclaim the gospel.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That night, more than ever before, I wanted to know the answers to these questions. I had always
believed in the divinity of Jesus Christ. I believed in Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, but
I wanted confirmation from the Lord. That night, as I prayed, the Spirit bore witness to my soul
of the Savior and the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet.
My brother received the same witness and made the choice to serve a mission. Incidentally,
when my brother returned from his mission, he went to medical school. When I reached my 20<sup>th</sup>
birthday, my father was happy to see me serve a mission.</span></font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the quest for both faith and knowledge, we also need to maintain humility. Those who have
attained significant amounts of specialized knowledge sometimes lose perspective about what
they don&#8217;t know. As &#8220;experts,&#8221; they elevate knowledge, particularly the knowledge in the area of
their expertise to an importance that is not warranted. They become prideful and loose their
humility.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In 2 Nephi 9:28 it reads,

and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not
unto the counsel of God . . .&#8221; </i></span></font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One reason to be humble about knowledge is that much of it is subject to change. I recently had a
conversation with my brother, Joe, who, as I indicated, is a medical doctor. He is 70 years old
and is about to take the medical recertification exam in his area of expertise for the sixth time. In
his specialty you are required to take the test every seven years; he has elected to take it every
six years. He laughingly indicated to me that the questions are the same as those presented over
35 years ago, but the answers keep changing. In the exam, 35 years ago, a typical multiple
choice question might be: What is the primary cause of a peptic ulcer?</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The answer would have related to stress. Today the answer to the same question would be that it
is caused by a certain kind of bacteria that can live and grow in the gastric tissue by the name of
		<i>H. pylori</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">. Thirty-five years ago the answer to the question: How do you treat ulcers? would have
related to reducing stress because it produces excess acid; stop eating spicy foods and change
your job, if necessary. Today the answer to how you treat ulcers would be a combination of
medications, including antibiotics and antisecretory agents. As you can see, the questions have
not changed, but many of the answers have. This is true in several fields of knowledge.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember when I was in my first year at Stanford Law School, one of the teachers told us that
it was important to learn the law and think like a lawyer, but not to memorize the laws. He
pointed out that the Legislature could change all of the laws in one session and everything
memorized would then be wrong. He noted that learning to think like a lawyer would be
valuable regardless of what laws exist at any particular time. </span><br />

will primarily allow you to raise, teach, and bless your family. We are particularly fortunate to
live in an age when the technological revolution is in progress. I continue to be amazed at what
can be learned over the Internet. I recently learned that Wikipedia, which I am sure you access
often, has around 939,000 articles and about 340 million words compared to the venerable
		<i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> (the gold standard in my day) which contains 85,000 articles and 55
million words. &#8220;Nature&#8221; magazine recently found that Wikipedia is almost as reliable as
		<i>Britannica,</i> although neither is completely accurate
(www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipediaoverview_FAQ#How_big_is_Wikipedia.3F). My children
and grandchildren utilize the Internet as a learning medium better than I do. The Church and the
Lord&#8217;s work are major beneficiaries of much that is happening. Our youth need to be a part of
that, as well as all knowledge. Remember the Glory of God is intelligence.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Many years ago I was visiting London with my family. We stayed at a hotel in Sloane Square.
There is a statue of Sir Hans Sloane in the center of the square. As a young man in the mid
1600s, Hans Sloane became a physician and then developed a strong interest in botany. The 17<sup>th</sup>
century physician used herbal remedies. Prescriptions were primarily herbal and not based on
chemistry as they are today. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In 1687 Sloane accompanied the Duke of Albemarle to Jamaica as his personal physician. He
catalogued the flora and fauna of Jamaica and identified about 800 new species of plants. He
collected specimens of animals as well and pickled them or embalmed them. During their stay,
Lord Albemarle died; it necessitated Sloane returning to London. Sloane pickled the body of
Lord Albemarle so Lord Albemarle could be buried in England. Upon Sloane&#8217;s return, he wrote
an extensive two volume natural history of Jamaica (www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Sloane).

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In Jamaica Sloane had noticed that the people drank cocoa which he found &#8220;nauseous.&#8221; Sloane
experimented with making medicines acceptable to children by mixing them with milk and
honey. He mixed the cocoa with milk and sugar and found that it was delicious. Sloane became
very wealthy when he sold his recipe to Cadbury Brothers who manufactured chocolate using
Sloane&#8217;s recipe (www.nhm.ac.wk/research-curation/projects/sloane-herbarium/hanssloane.htm).</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What is perhaps most interesting to me is that Sloane used most of that money to collect
botanical and other specimens that he had become so intrigued with as a young physician. He
bought people&#8217;s collected specimens from all over the world and he put together an enormous
collection. When he died, he donated it to the British nation. That was the beginning of the
British Museum.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The foundation collection of the natural history part of the entire British Museum came because
of the great desire for knowledge of that incredible man, Hans Sloane. </span>

Elder Russell M. Nelson, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was a pioneer in the
development of open heart surgery which has significantly blessed those who live at this time.
We were together in the Pacific Islands for an area training meeting. I asked him about that
incredible history and his role in it. We discussed it for some time and then Elder Nelson humbly
stated, <i>&#8220;. . . how wonderful it is that the Lord who knows

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Vava&#8217;u, which is a relatively small island, usually has sufficient rain, but
periodically there are severe droughts. The island has long inlets or bays, almost
like sounds, which curl into the island below steep hills. When drought conditions
left the village without water, there was only one way they could obtain fresh
water and stay alive. Over the centuries, they had found that fresh water traveled
down through rock formations inside the mountains and came up in a few spots in
the sea.</i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The Tongan men would set off in their small boats with a wise elder standing at
one end of the boat looking for just the right spot. The strong young men in the
boat stood ready with containers to dive deep into the sea water. When they
reached the appropriate spot, the wise man would raise both arms to heaven.
That was the signal. The strong young men would dive off the boat as deep as
they could and fill the containers with fresh spring water.</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This old patriarch likened this life saving tradition to the living waters of the gospel of Jesus
Christ and the wise man to God&#8217;s prophet here on earth. He noted that the water was pure, fresh,
and in their drought condition&#8212;life saving. But it was not easy to find. It was not visible to the
untrained eye. This patriarch wanted to know everything the prophet was teaching.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We live in a precarious time. The world is in desperate need of the fresh spring water, which is
the gospel of Jesus Christ. The spiritual war for the souls of men is raging and there are
diminishing numbers of people who support our position.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In a Worldwide Leadership Training meeting, President Hinckley said:</span></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>No one need tell you that we are living in a very difficult season in the history of
the world. Standards are dropping everywhere. Nothing seems to be sacred
anymore. . . . I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and
Gomorrah . . . I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward
sons and daughters </i>(President Gordon B. Hinckley, &#8220;Standing Strong and
Immovable,&#8221; <i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting</i>, Jan. 10, 2004, p 20).</span><br />
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As is characteristic of President Hinckley&#8217;s positive leadership, he went on to say, 
		<i>&#8220;We must not
give up. We must not become discouraged. We must never surrender to the forces of evil. . . . If it
means standing alone, we must do it. But we shall not be alone&#8221; </i>(President Gordon B. Hinckley,
&#8220;Standing Strong and Immovable,&#8221; <i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting</i>, Jan. 10, 2004, p
20).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Prophets are not speaking just to our own day; they give us counsel that will bless us and our
children in the future and through the eternities.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I think about the time when I was your age, one specific example comes to mind. During the
late 1960s, illegal drug usage reached epidemic proportions throughout the US. I completed law
school in 1966 and then lived on the San Francisco peninsula in the Bay Area.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Bay Area was a magnet for drug use and all manner of promiscuous and sinful conduct. The
impact on many high school and college students was devastating. While there were some
members who rebelled and were caught up in the drug culture, the vast majority of LDS youth
were able to avoid it. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What allowed the Latter-day Saints to be protected? President Heber J. Grant, president of the
Church and Prophet from 1918 to 1945, had been inspired to emphasize adherence to the Word
of Wisdom (Heber J. Grant, &#8220;Observing the Word of Wisdom,&#8221; <i>Teachings of the Presidents of
the Church Heber J. Grant, </i>pgs 189-197<i>.</i> See also Doctrine and Covenants 89). He stressed the
importance of not smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages, and directed the bishops to review
the principles in temple recommend interviews.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In that period of time smoking was accepted by society as an appropriate behavior. Most
political leaders smoked and the movies made smoking appear glamorous. The medical
profession seemed to accept smoking with little concern. President Grant counseled with great
vigor against both smoking and drinking.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">During and following the Second World War, Latter-day Saints moved to many locations,
especially the west coast, and they became known as a people who did not drink or smoke.
Obeying the Word of Wisdom gave our members an inoculation against the coming epidemic of
drugs, which was even more serious. A prophet&#8217;s teaching saved generations of young people
from both terrible health and moral hazards.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We must listen intently to the Prophet as we make our choices. Commit yourself to following all
of his counsel. Later in your lives you will see how following the teachings of the Prophet saved
your generation, as it has past generations.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we follow the Prophet, we can look to the future with great optimism. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I look at President Hinckley&#8217;s ministry, I think there is good reason for us to be optimistic.
When President Hinckley was a new General Authority, there were approximately 1.5 million
members; today there are over 12 million members. When he first became president of the
Church, there were 47 temples operating; today there are 122 in operation.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Doctrine and Covenants 1 verse 30 makes it clear that one of the objectives of the leadership of
the Church is to bring it out of obscurity. Think of all that President Hinckley has done to
accomplish this: the Mike Wallace interview, the Larry King interviews, the National Press Club
speech, interviews from media all over the world in connection with the Olympics, and much,
much more. President Hinckley has clearly helped bring the Church out of obscurity. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley is the great leader for our generation. He is our &#8220;prophet,&#8221; but we need to
follow his teaching. We need to understand how difficult the war for the souls of men has
become and recommit ourselves to follow his counsel.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I exhort you with all of my heart to follow the Prophet&#8217;s counsel as you make your choices.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The fifth principle is to live so that the atonement can be fully efficacious in your life.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As indicated previously,<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>rationalization for bad choices will not be effective, but repentance will.
Those who repent will be particularly blessed by the atonement (&#8220;The Atonement,&#8221; 
		<i>Gospel
Principles</i>, p 75. See also &#8220;Atonement of Jesus Christ,&#8221; <i>True to the Faith, A Gospel Reference,</i> p
14). Without the atonement the eternal principle of <i>Justice</i> would require punishment.<sup>24</sup> Because
of the atonement <i>Mercy</i> can prevail for those who have repented and allow them to return to the
presence of God (Alma 42:15).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I first understood the full significance of the atonement when my grandfather was dying. I was
studying for the California bar exam when my mother called and said if I wanted to see my
grandfather before he died, I better come to Utah. My grandfather, who was 86 years old, was
very ill. He was so pleased to see me and share his testimony.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There were three concerns that he had:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">1.He loved his ten children very much. They were all good people. He
wanted them all to be temple worthy.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">2.His father was one of the young men who had carried members of the
Martin Handcart Company across the Sweetwater. His father had died
when my grandfather was three years old and he looked forward to seeing
him and hoped his father and other family members would approve of his
life.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">3.Finally, and most importantly, he told me how he looked forward to
meeting the Savior. He referred to the Savior as the <i>&#8220;Keeper of the Gate,&#8221;
		</i>a reference to 2 Nephi 9:41. He told me that he hoped he had been
sufficiently repentant to qualify for the Savior&#8217;s mercy.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">All of us have sinned and it is only through the atonement that we can obtain mercy and live
with God. I can remember to this day the great love that grandfather had for the Savior and the
appreciation he had for the atonement.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Brother Hugh Nibley has said, speaking of the atonement, it is
		<i>&#8220;the one supreme reality of our
life upon this earth&#8221;</i> (Hugh Nibley, <i>World and the Prophets</i>, pp 263-64).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley has taught,

<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080">Brigham Young University&#8211;Idaho Mothers&#39; Weekend Welcome</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080">March 17, 2006</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for the opportunity to welcome this wonderful group of mothers to BYU&#8211;Idaho. I
want you to know how much we love your children and how blessed we are to have them here
on this campus. The light in their eyes and the quality of their lives reflects your love and spirit
and faith. May God our Father bless you to know of His love for you as mothers in Zion.
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for the privilege of speaking to you today about the theme for Mother&#8217;s Weekend:
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Abound in Good Works. </span>To abound is to be abundant, plentiful; to overflow; to burst forth; to
multiply. Good works, of course, are those actions that bring souls to Christ, they are the things
that He would do if He were here, they bring light into the world, and they establish
righteousness. If one of our sisters abounds in good works, for example, it may be said of her
that there is in her life an overflowing of Christlike service, an abundance of acts of kindness and
love, a bursting forth of goodness that blesses all she touches. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the Book of Mormon the Lord makes clear that such abundance of goodness comes through
the grace of the Savior and the ministry of the Holy Ghost. Please turn to Alma 7:24, the source
of our theme today:<i> &#8220;And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always
abound in good works.&#8221;</i><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is important to note that this verse comes in a chapter in which Alma lays out very powerfully
the doctrine of Christ&#8217;s Atonement. In Ether, Moroni clarifies the connection between faith,
hope, and abounding in good works. Let&#8217;s look at Ether 12:4:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world,
yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an
anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast,
		<span style="font-weight: bold">always
abounding in good works</span>, being led to glorify God </i>(emphasis added)<i>.</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Here we see that faith in the Savior&#8217;s Atonement leads to hope for a better world and, thus, to
action&#8212;repentance, sacred covenants, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and good works that glorify
God. Charity is central to this process of abundance. In Moroni&#160;8:25-26, Mormon taught:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the
fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth
remission of sins;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because
of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost,
		<span style="font-weight: bold">which
Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love</span>, which love endureth by diligence
unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God</i>
(emphasis added).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If we look at these verses very carefully, we can see in them the Lord&#8217;s plan for a life of
abundance: The first principles and ordinances of the gospel bring about forgiveness, humility,
and a newness of spiritual life. Through the Atonement we are made clean, our hearts are
changed, and we receive the ministry of the Holy Ghost. Charity, or that &#8220;perfect love&#8221; which is
Christ&#8217;s, comes as a gift of the Spirit. Coupled with faith in the Savior and hope for a glorious
resurrection, there is in that love a powerful motivation to do good. And there is in the<i>
&#8220;endurance by diligence unto prayer&#8221; </i>a persistent, growing abundance of good. Indeed, there is<i>
&#8220;abounding in good works.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Such marvelous abundance does not come all at once. It is rather like a fruitful tree, requiring
planting, and nurturing, and pruning. But with all of that, grace upon grace, comes 
		<i>&#8220;. . . much
precious fruit&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 97:9).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I believe the Lord has provided a way for us to become fruitful and to abound in good works.
There is in the kingdom of God three stages of personal development, each related to the other,
that create what I would like to call the Path of Abundance: </font></p>

comfort . . . to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all
places . . . . </i>(Mosiah 18:8-9).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The organizations in the Church&#8212;visiting teaching, home teaching, callings in the ward
organizations, serving in the temple and on missions&#8212;create opportunities for us to fulfill our
covenants. In all of these experiences, we learn both what we must do to bring about good works
and what it feels like to do it. Though the work is organized and structured, yet it is real; the
work is good and directed by the Spirit. We learn what the Lord&#8217;s work is and how He does it.
Along the way we are tutored by our leaders, we see others and learn by example, and we
receive inspiration and guidance from the Spirit. We grow in our spiritual capacity, and we learn
to bring about righteousness. In its structure, in its processes, in its engagement of each of us, the
Church is a marvelous school of good works. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Becoming a Trusted Servant of the Lord</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord&#8217;s work is not done only through the formal organization of the Church. As we grow in
our faith and in our spiritual capacity, we may become a trusted servant of the Lord. The Lord&#8217;s
trusted servants receive personal assignments from Him. This is why He said of His servants
who would build Zion:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">yea, and with
commandments not a few</span>, and with revelations in their time&#8212;they that are
faithful and diligent before me</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 59:4, emphasis added).<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When He trusts us, when He knows that we will do what He asks us to do, He sends us on His
errand. These impressions may be within the purview of our callings, but they may not be part of
our formal assignments. We know from many examples in the scriptures that some of these
assignments come from angels sent as messengers of the Lord. But many of them come as gentle
whispers or impressions. They may send us to someone&#8217;s house with a loaf of bread; they may
send us down the hall to talk with a struggling child; they may urge us to speak to the person
next to us on the airplane; they may send us to find a document that opens the blessings of the
temple to one of our ancestors; they may come in countless ways. If we learn to hear them, the
Lord will use us to do His work. And we will become more abundant in good works.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">A Light to the World</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are two scriptures that define the third stage on the Path of Abundance. The first is in the
Sermon on the Mount. In Matthew 5:14-16 the Lord says:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick;
and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father which is in heaven. </i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The second scripture is in Doctrine and Covenants 58:27-28:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many
things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves . . . .</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In this third stage, the abundance of good works comes not only from formal organization, or
from specific assignments from the Lord, but from the light and power of the Lord Jesus Christ
that is in us. It comes from the total character of our lives. It comes because we put true
principles into action in everything we do so that those around us may see the light of the gospel
in action. It comes because we give our will to the Lord; take His yoke upon us; and, exercising
our agency, do what He would do if He were here. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Let me share with you a story about two of our close friends that illustrates what it means to be 
		<i>a
&#8220;light to the world.&#8221; </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">About two years ago, Steve and Margaret Wheelwright moved into a new house on a street in
Belmont, Massachusetts, where they once had lived. They had known their next-door neighbor,
Barbara, a bit and got to know her better this time. She was in her 80s. Although Barbara had
been reared in the Church, she had not been actively involved since she left home at the age of
18. On their visits, Steve and Margaret grew to love Barbara and her family, including Barbara&#8217;s
daughter Karen who was suffering from stomach cancer. On one visit, Steve talked with Barbara
and Karen about priesthood blessings and asked if Karen might like a blessing. Karen was not a
member of the Church, but she was grateful and asked Steve to give her a blessing. Not long
after, Steve and the bishop of the ward administered to Karen. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, there is one thing you need to understand before I go on. About a year before this
happened, Steve and Margaret returned from serving a mission in London where Steve presided
over the England London Mission. They had a great experience in London and returned on fire! 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It should be no surprise, therefore, that Steve and Margaret talked to Karen about learning more
about the Church. Karen was interested, so they began to teach her. It was a glorious experience.
It turns out that Karen and Barbara come from a long line of Mormon pioneers, including the
Wooleys. She thrilled to hear of the Restoration and received a powerful witness of the truth of
the gospel. At the time, she was in the end stage of terminal cancer and was in tremendous pain.
But she came to Church and rejoiced with the Saints even though it was a physical ordeal. She
told Steve and Margaret: &#8220;I want to know just as much about the gospel as if I had been raised in
the Church all my life.&#8221; If you knew Karen, you knew what the scriptures mean when they speak
of &#8220;hungering and thirsting after righteousness.&#8221; She was baptized in November of 2004. Karen
was a professional musician and music teacher; she played the trumpet. Some of her LDS
students joined her in playing <i>God of Our Fathers</i> with trumpet fanfare at her baptism. There
wasn&#8217;t a dry eye in the room. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Karen died a few weeks after her baptism. Just a few weeks ago, Margaret did Karen&#8217;s temple
work; Barbara wept at the news. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is an example of two sweet people being a light to the world and bringing about much
righteousness of their own free will. There was no formal assignment here. And while I believe
the Lord sent Steve and Margaret to that neighborhood, it was the pure love of Christ in them, it
was the light in their eyes and the spirit in their hearts, that touched Karen and helped her trust
them and love them. They brought the gospel to Karen because she could feel its power in them.
Steve and Margaret truly abounded in good works. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Role of Mothers</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Path of Abundance is part of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan for us. He desires that all of us
grow step by step, grace for grace, in spiritual strength and maturity, and thus in the abundance
of good works in our lives. I believe that the best place to learn about the Path of Abundance and
to see it in action is in our families. Indeed, I believe it is by divine design that fathers and
mothers teach their children how to live the abundant life, a life abounding in good works. Listen
to the words of the Proclamation on the Family:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to
provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one
another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens
wherever they live. . . </i>(The Family: A Proclamation to the World, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, Nov
1995, p. 102).<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we are little, our moms and dads establish standards, create structure, and define
boundaries. They teach us about Jesus and the doctrines of salvation. They give us assignments
and organize experiences in which we learn to do good works. When we are little, our parents
are also growing and learning. As we grow older, our parents become examples to us and their
personal values and behavior become influential in shaping our understanding of the gospel.
When they become trusted servants of the Lord, we see it and feel it and recognize in our parents
the abundance of good works. And there comes a time when we have grown and matured further
that we feel and know of the power that is within them and the light that is in their lives. This is
why the Lord has commanded parents to <i>&#8220;. . . bring up your children in light and truth&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 93:40).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As I have reflected on the powerful impact of parents, I have been naturally drawn to the effect
of my mother on me. I can see in her life the Path of Abundance.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">From a very early age, my mother made sure that I learned discipline, hard work, and obedience.
When I was five years old, she enrolled me in elocution classes. Every Saturday morning for five
years I went to Grace Nixon Stewart&#8217;s School for Elocution. We learned poetry, scriptures,
vocabulary words, and dramatic readings. There were assignments each week, and every
morning my mother got me up early and made me practice my lessons. Remember, I am five
years old when this is going on. There I was at 6 a.m. in my pajamas saying things like:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>O, my love is like a red, red rose,</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>that&#8217;s newly sprung in June.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>O, my love is like a melody,</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>that&#8217;s sweetly play&#8217;d in tune</i> (Robert Burns).<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My mother taught me to pray, to love the scriptures, to attend church, and to live the gospel in
those early years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I grew older (and my mother grew older), I saw her become a trusted servant of the Lord.
When I was 11 years old, we moved to Spokane, Washington. My mother was 42. Not long after
we moved there, she became (in my eyes) a leader. For almost 15 years she served as stake
Relief Society president. In that time my mother had many formal assignments, but she was
always doing things for other people that had nothing to do with her formal calling. I did not
understand it at the time, but my mother was a trusted servant of the Lord. He sent her on many,
many errands. And so I learned through her example, and through her values, what it means to
abound in good works. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Once I left home to go to college and then to serve a mission, I came to understand the great
spirit that my mother created in our home. I recognized that my mother brought light to
everything she did. I think I needed the distance from her to recognize and appreciate it. Looking
back, I was privileged to be born to a mother who was a light to the world. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Later in their lives, my mom and dad served a mission in the Philippines. What a blessing my
mom and dad were to the people in the Davao Mission. I have seen many pictures of my mom
standing with the Saints in the Philippines, and there is a joy and a light in their eyes and in hers
that is inspiring.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My mom was only five feet tall, but she was a spiritual giant. Many years ago I wrote a poem for
her that I would like to read to you today. It captures how I feel about her even to this day. And I
believe it will be a fitting conclusion to my talk about abounding in good works. As I read it, I
hope each of you here today will reflect on your own mother and the love you have for her. Here
is the poem:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080"><i>When I was a boy I looked up at my mom</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><font color="#000080"><i>&#8220;Gee, Mom,&#8221; I&#8217;d say, &#8220;you&#8217;re kinda little.&#8221;</i></font></p>

<font color="#000080">I leave you with my testimony. I know our Heavenly Father lives. I know He loves us. I know
He gave His only Begotten Son to suffer and die that we might live the abundant life, forever. I
love Him and honor Him and praise His name. This is His church and kingdom. The Path of
Abundance is His path. I pray that we may walk it and serve Him all the days of our lives. In the
sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen. </font></p>

		Mothers&#39; Weekend Welcome</p>
<p style="text-align: left">March 17, 2006</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">We are happy to have this opportunity to address you and welcome you at the beginning of this
Mothers&#8217; Weekend. It is one of the highlight events of the semester, of the year. We welcome
you, mothers. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Your student children are so wonderful. We enjoy their spirit of commitment and hard work. As
President Clark and I get the opportunity to look into their faces as we greet them around
campus, we see a light there that reflects a very special spirit. In Alma, chapter 7 (where the
theme for this weekend is found), I read about what I see in their faces. In verses 23 and 24:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to
be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things;
being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for
whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning
thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in
good works.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are grateful to have your children at BYU&#8211;Idaho. We are grateful for choices they made
while living at home that built in them a commitment to the gospel that makes them worthy to
attend here. We are grateful for their dedication to active membership in their wards on campus
where they serve and teach one another. Activity in the ward is fundamental to their growth
while they are here.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Each Monday night we have the opportunity to engage with a few students in a family home
evening meeting. The students sign up as individuals or as groups (sometimes as family home
evening groups and sometimes as whole wards). They ask us questions, and we answer their
questions as best we can. We love family home evenings with your children. When we have a
ward for family home evening, we see firsthand the associations they build there. We are so
grateful for ward leaders. I hope you get the opportunity to attend your student&#8217;s ward on Sunday
and meet the bishopric and perhaps some of the stake leaders. These men and women from
Rexburg and the surrounding communities consecrate their service to our students. We are so
grateful for them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are grateful to you. The foundation provided by family in your sons and daughters is a great
blessing. As I think about the joy you as mothers are feeling in the company of your sons and
daughters, I am reminded of the larger family to which we all belong. Being brothers and sisters,
children of our Father in Heaven, is the source of many blessings during our sojourn here. Let
me talk of that family for just a moment.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">We know, through revelation, of our experience before we came to earth where we lived with
our heavenly parents. There we attended the council where our futures were discussed and the
plan explained. In Abraham, chapter 3, and Moses, chapter 4, we read the words of the Savior&#8217;s
plan (which was the Father&#8217;s plan). In Abraham, chapter 3, verses 24-25:

<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those
who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of
these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the
Lord their God shall command them; </i><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And in Moses, chapter 4, verse 2:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Revelation, chapter 12, we read about the war that then took place in which Lucifer and his
followers rebelled against the plan. Agency was the issue. In the Bible Dictionary we read:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>The spirits who thus rebelled and persisted were thrust out of heaven and cast
down to the earth without mortal bodies, &#8220;and thus came the devil and his
angels&#8221;</i> (Bible Dictionary, &#8220;War in Heaven&#8221;).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, we know that because we have physical bodies we chose the Savior Jesus
Christ&#8217;s plan. That choice brought us to earth with the Light of Christ within us. Our goal is to
build on the light we have been given. That goal is not attainable without a battle of our own.

<font color="#000080"><i>The warfare is continued in mortality in the conflict between right and
wrong; between the gospel and false principles, etc. The same contestants
and the same issues are doing battle, and the same salvation is at stake</i>

<p style="margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">The mission of BYU&#8211;Idaho is to prepare young people to be valiant in their battle. Our
goal is to have them leave here as &#8220;disciple leaders&#8221;&#8212;firm and steadfast in their
testimonies of the Savior having experienced success in developing those characteristics
we see in their faces that I read about in our theme scripture.</font></p>

<p style="margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">In January at the beginning of this semester, President Clark spoke to the students about
this very special school where faith, devotion, and obedience prepare true disciples and
trusted servants who give their hearts and minds to the Lord. He taught the students about
the Honor Code and explained how they should determine where they stand in their
commitment to obedience to the principles outlined for them therein.</font></p>
<p style="margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">Let me read from President Clark&#8217;s talk:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>The Honor Code includes many things that we might describe as great:
honesty and integrity, avoiding pornography, living the law of chastity,
and the Word of Wisdom, indeed, the gospel of Jesus Christ. But it also
contains many rules against things that we might describe as small: flip-flops; curfew; torn or ragged jeans; long sideburns; shorts and capris;
form-fitting tops and pants and other immodest styles; beards;
&#8220;underwear styles&#8221; of clothing; and much else. Some of you may wonder
why we have such small things in the Honor Code</i> (Brigham Young
University-Idaho Devotional, January 10, 2006).</font></p>
<p style="margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Clark&#8217;s talk is titled &#8220;Out of Small Things Proceedeth that Which is Great.&#8221; It is a
wonderful and inspired talk to the students. Each student subsequently received a copy of the
talk through his or her ward. I would encourage you mothers to talk to your student(s) about it. It
is available on the BYU&#8211;Idaho Web page. Click on <i>Quick Links</i>, and you can find the talk and
read or print it.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The experience of living the Honor Code in the &#8220;zone of discipleship,&#8221; as explained by President
Clark, builds on the foundations the students come here with and strengthens those
characteristics related in our theme scripture that are reflected in their faces all across campus.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am grateful for the Spirit that brings to this community an atmosphere in which the Holy Ghost
ministers daily. We refer to this as the Spirit of Ricks. In that spirit we &#8220;abound in good works.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I leave you my testimony of these principles and blessings so generously bestowed upon us by
our Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>

<p><font color="#000080"><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Thank you for this award and for thinking of me in such a special way. I have a deep-rooted
affection for this institution and feel it a privilege and an honor to have been associated with
dedicated employees and so many incredible students. I shall treasure forever the experiences I
had on this campus with the wonderful people who have been a part of both Ricks College and
BYU&#8211;Idaho. I love this place, and I love you! Thank you for inviting us to come back.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I would like to thank my brother, Lane, and my sister, Teri, for being here with me tonight. I
would also like to introduce you to my parents, Kay and Nyla Robinson. I thank my Father in
Heaven daily for wonderful parents. They just celebrated their 57<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary on
March 8. When I think of what they have given me, I cannot help but recall a line from 
		<i>The
Family: A Proclamation to the World</i> which states: <i>&#8220;Children are entitled to birth within the
bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with
complete fidelity&#8221;</i> (<i>Ensign, </i>Nov. 1995, 102). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I express love and appreciation to my parents for the sense of security and wellbeing that I have
always felt in their home. As a child I always knew my parents loved each other, were faithful to
each other, and honored their temple marriage covenants. They have set an example of love and
fidelity in marriage for their children, their grandchildren, and great grandchildren.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I am thankful that our son, Jeffrey, could be here with us tonight. One of my favorite memories
of the day my husband was called to the Twelve was the picture that was taken that day after the
Saturday afternoon session of conference when Elder Bednar saw Jeff for the first time. In tears
Jeff hugged and congratulated his father and then said, &#8220;Dad, this new calling is really going to
mess up my dating life!&#8221;<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am thrilled to be here with my husband. Elder Bednar and I do not often get to sit by each other
in meetings any more, so it is a treat to have him here at my side. I appreciate his love and
support and the many ways he involved me in activities on campus during the time we were
here. I feel much the same way Oliver Cowdery did when he described his involvement in the
magnificent events of the restoration. He wrote, <i>&#8220;These were days never to be forgotten.&#8221; 
		</i>We
echo that same sentiment about our time spent here in Rexburg. An abundance of love and fond,
unforgettable memories are tucked away in our hearts, never to be forgotten.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I always enjoyed Mother&#8217;s Weekend at BYU&#8211;Idaho. Watching students prepare for their mothers
to come and visit was quite a sight to behold. Sheets that hadn&#8217;t been washed all semester found
their way into the laundry. Cluttered apartments received HGTV Mission: Organization make-overs, and some students even managed to do minimal grocery shopping.
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I once met a young woman at the grocery store the morning her mother was to arrive. I asked,
&#8220;Why are you buying food before your mother comes? Don&#8217;t you know you&#8217;re supposed to wait
for her to fill your cupboards with high budget food?&#8221; This young woman replied, &#8220;I just thought
my mom would like something for breakfast.&#8221; I was impressed&#8212;how sensitive and thoughtful.
But as I looked at the two items on the conveyor belt I thought, &#8220;My dear mother, I sure hope
you like Lucky Charms and Moon Pies as part of your healthy, well-balanced, morning diet.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The most unforgettable Mother&#8217;s Weekend fireside during our tenure here was when the
speaker&#8217;s plane could not land in Idaho Falls due to snowy weather. At the last minute we had to
quickly improvise a fireside program. Thankfully, I&#8217;ve had a bit more time to prepare for this
fireside. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I feel blessed to be here tonight with you students and your mothers. This is a special weekend
for those whose mothers have come to campus. If your mother is not here, I would love to be
your mother for the evening. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You have come with expectations to be spiritually fed. I have come bearing an enormous
responsibility to meet your expectations. I pray for heaven to help us tonight&#8212;that through the
gift of the Holy Ghost we will communicate spirit to spirit and heart to heart.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The theme for this weekend is taken from Alma 7: &#8220;<i>And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity,
and then ye will <span style="font-weight: bold">always abound in good works&#8221;</span></i> (Alma 7:24; emphasis added).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As I have thought about this theme over the past few months, I have decided to discuss three
important principles that motivate us to do good works: 1) faith to follow the teachings of living
prophets; 2) hope received through temple covenants; and 3) charity towards all.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Faith to follow the teachings of living prophets</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We know that faith as a principle of action is centered in our Savior, Jesus Christ. This gift
moves us to act on the teachings, admonitions, and counsel of living apostles and prophets who
are spokesmen for the Savior on earth.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Spencer W. Kimball was called as the prophet when I was a single student at Brigham
Young University, and he continued serving as the prophet during the years I was a young
mother. I am sure that you students feel the same type of affection and regard for President
Gordon B. Hinckley as the prophet of your youth as I did for President Kimball.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I share an important teaching of President Kimball which affected the way Elder Bednar and
I raised our sons, perhaps each of you here tonight can remember and reflect on counsel from the
prophet of your youth that has inspired you to <i>always abound in good works.</i><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At an impressionable, youthful time when Elder Bednar and I were considering marriage,
President Kimball gave prophetic counsel concerning missionary work that we have never
forgotten. Let me share his plea with you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>When I ask for more missionaries, I am not asking for more testimony-barren or
unworthy missionaries. I am asking that we start earlier and train our
missionaries better in every branch and every ward in the world. That is another
challenge&#8212;that the young people will understand that it is a great privilege to go
on a mission and that they must be physically well, mentally well, spiritually well,
and that &#8216;the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.&#8217;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>&#8220;I am asking for missionaries who have been carefully indoctrinated and trained
through the family and the organizations of the Church, and who come to the
mission with a great desire. </i>(The word indoctrinate as President Kimball was
using it means to instruct in fundamentals.)<i> I am asking for better interviews,
more searching interviews, more sympathetic and understanding interviews, but
especially that we train prospective missionaries much better, much earlier, much
longer, so that each anticipates his mission with great joy </i>(Spencer W. Kimball,
&#8220;When the World Will Be Converted,&#8221; <i>Ensign</i>, October 1974, 7). 
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As Elder Bednar and I were married and blessed with three sons, President Kimball&#8217;s appeal for
well prepared missionaries sparked in us a desire to train our sons for missionary service in the
best way that we could. We started early to teach our sons. We read the scriptures as a family
and encouraged these sons to read them on their own. In fact, because they were capable of
doing so, all of them read the Book of Mormon and memorized the Articles of Faith before they
were baptized.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My husband served as a stake president during the time our sons were growing up, and he would
often take one of them with him in the car on Sunday to visit a distant branch in our stake. On
the way he would ask our sons how they would respond to certain questions an investigator
might ask, and then he would assume the role of a very inquisitive, tough investigator.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We both conducted careful interviews with them. My husband&#8217;s interviews were a bit more
formal, mine a little more casual. Mine occurred as I would cut their hair each month. Having a
wiggly, wet-headed son sitting on a chair with a cape around his neck was like holding him
captive. I could make the haircuts last as long as I liked. They tended to last longer depending on
the conversation we were having. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">During this time I was able to visit with each &#8220;hostage&#8221; and inquire about what was going on in
his life, discover what things were troubling him, and assess his feelings about gospel principles.
What started out as a financial necessity turned into a spiritual opportunity&#8212;a meaningful time
to interview and to teach and train and testify to each one of our sons.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Responding to President Kimball&#8217;s call for better missionaries was always on our minds. I
realized just how much this was on my mind one day when the boys and I had a near-death
experience in the car on the way home from school.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I had picked up our older boys from their elementary school driving a car that had a stick shift.
Why I was driving that particular car that day, I do not know, because I was a terrible driver with
a stick shift. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We were traveling on the bypass that went around Lubbock, Texas, going about 65 miles an hour
when a school bus, going about 40 miles per hour, pulled in front of me. Sandwiched in by cars
on all sides, I immediately tried to hit the brake, but there was no response. I do not know where
my foot landed, but it was not on the brake. Right at the time I thought we were going to collide
into the back of the school bus, I put a hand in front of my face and pled, &#8220;Heavenly Father,
please don&#8217;t let us crash. These little boys need to grow up to be missionaries.&#8221; 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">With divine assistance my foot found the brake, and those little boys did grow up to be
missionaries. And they were faithful missionaries who were well prepared, carefully
&#8220;indoctrinated,&#8221; and trained through the family and the organizations of the Church because of
meaningful instruction from a prophet of God, President Kimball.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As I have been sharing my own experiences, what counsel from prophets have you mothers
remembered? What teachings from President Hinckley have you students recalled that will help
you to <i>abound in good works?</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Will you remember the six &#8220;B&#8217;s&#8221; he taught?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<font color="#000080"><i>Be prayerful.</i><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Will you remember the prayer President Hinckley offered for you after he gave this advice? I
was seated here in the Hart Auditorium with BYU&#8211;Idaho Students when he prayed for you.
What a powerful spirit permeated the room as he petitioned our Heavenly Father,</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Please help them to walk in paths of truth and righteousness and keep them from
the evils of the world. Bless them that they shall be happy at times and serious at
times, that they may enjoy life and drink of its fulness. Bless them that they may
walk acceptably before Thee as Thy cherished sons and daughters. Each is Thy
child with capacity to do great and noble things</i> (A Prophet&#8217;s Counsel and Prayer
for Youth, <i>Ensign</i>, Jan. 2001, 2).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I know we will all remember President Hinckley&#8217;s recent invitation to read the Book of Mormon.
What did we learn from that experience? What blessings and insights came because we were
willing to follow the counsel of a prophet of God? What prophetic teachings from President
Hinckley have had a deep impact on your life? Please share these teachings with your children as
they come.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May our faith to follow the counsel of living prophets assist us to 
		<i>always abound in good works</i>.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Hope received through temple covenants</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let us talk for just a few minutes about hope. We know that faith in Jesus Christ leads to hope in
His Atonement. In Moroni chapter 7, verse 41 in the Book of Mormon, we read: <i>&#8220;And what is it
that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of
Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your
faith in him according to the promise&#8221;</i> (Moroni 7:41).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Teachings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ about the plan of happiness give us hope for
eternal life. It is an eternal truth that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we are resurrected
and will live forever with Him and our Heavenly Father. We also know that through the
ordinances of the temple we can be sealed to those we love for time and all eternity. These
eternal hopes and aspirations create in us a desire to live so that the promised blessings of the
temple can be efficacious through our faithful obedience. In other words, hope received through
temple covenants gives us strength to <i>always abound in good works</i>.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As I was sitting here, I could not help but remember what I was doing 31 years ago today on
March 19 at 5:30 p.m., this very moment! I was seated next to my mother in the Provo temple,
receiving my endowment in preparation for my marriage to Elder Bednar the next morning in the
Salt Lake Temple.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Tomorrow is our anniversary, and I remember the feelings of love I felt for him as we knelt at
the altar and entered into the covenant of eternal marriage. My mind has gone back many times
to the wonderful love and the peace that I felt at that moment&#8212;not only to reminisce or reflect,
but to remember those feelings of love when we have had a misunderstanding or a disagreement,
or when I have felt a distance between us that needed to be narrowed. Returning in my heart and
mind to that sacred time and place has always filled me with a renewal of love and a sense of
hope coupled with a desire to do and to be better. This exercise was particularly meaningful for
the twenty years we lived so far away from a temple.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I cannot tell you how grateful I was to be so close to the Idaho Falls Temple when we moved to
Rexburg. During one of my visits to the temple, I noticed several women whom I knew in
attendance there. I was aware that each one had a care or concern that required divine help and
strength. One sister was pondering how she could best assist a wayward son. Another was
praying for courage to leave her home and family as her husband accepted an assignment to be a
mission president. Still another was dealing with the loneliness of being single. Another was
seeking guidance on how to deal with her physically and mentally challenged child. I am certain
each sister left the temple that day with renewed hope and strength to meet the challenges facing
her. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How wonderful that we can go to the temple to do vicarious work for someone else and come
away receiving more than we could ever give. In the strength of the Lord we can do all things.
Temple attendance brings renewed hope and increased strength to <i>always abound in good works</i>. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am so excited that a temple is being constructed right here on this very campus. Let me share
an experience that I think demonstrated the readiness of BYU&#8211;Idaho students to have a temple.
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On April 6, 2000, Elder Bednar and I gathered together with students in the Taylor Chapel for
the satellite broadcast of the dedication of the Palmyra Temple. The early morning temple
dedication required students to be in their seats by 6:30 a.m. We arrived a few minutes after 6:00
a.m. and found the whole chapel and overflow filled with students. I was told that some people
had arrived at 4:00 a.m. I was glad my husband and I had a reserved seat! </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The demeanor and reverence of the students was impressive. But what impressed me most that
day was the unusual response to what happened when we lost the satellite feed right as President
Hinckley was ready to make his remarks before offering the dedicatory prayer.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The students sat in total silence for almost an hour waiting for the audiovisual capabilities to be
restored which, by the way, never were. Their sense of solemn regard for this special, historic
occasion amazed me. Those in attendance had come seeking the spirit, and they left feeling it
despite the technical difficulties and disappointment of not participating in the entire dedicatory
session. More importantly, these students showed by their spiritual maturity that they and others
like them are ready and worthy of the magnificent blessing of having a temple on this campus.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To think that you students will have a celestial place where you can slip away from the pressures
of your studies, where you can sort out the complexities of your lives, and where you can pray to
feel a sense of peace and assurance about the decisions you are making right now warms my
heart. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Each of you can serve in this sacred, vicarious work whether in the baptistry, or in an initiatory,
endowment, or sealing session. This holy edifice will be a <i>&#8220;Light on a Hill&#8221; 
		</i>whose light will
shine in you as you participate in this holy work. You will go forth from this house armed with
the Savior&#8217;s power. His name will be upon you, His glory round about you, and His angels will
have charge over you (see Doctrine and Covenants 109:22). </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Think of the blessings that can come to you individually and collectively as a student body if you
invite the temple to be a symbol of your membership in the Church. I hope this temple will be
the most highly used temple in the Church. It should be! Because of hope received through our
temple covenants, we gain strength to continue in good works.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Charity towards all</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We have talked about faith and hope. Now let us discuss how charity towards all moves us to do
good works. In Alma chapter 13 we read:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<font color="#000080"><i>And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great
anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your
sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name,
and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye
can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive,
patient, full of love and all long-suffering;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and
enter into his rest</i> (Alma 13:27-29).<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We know from the scriptures that this love of God is charity, a spiritual gift.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Bruce R. McConkie said: </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Above all the attributes of godliness and perfection, charity is the one most
devoutly to be desired. Charity is more than love, far more; it is everlasting love,
perfect love, the pure love of Christ which endureth forever. It is love so centered
in righteousness that the possessor has no aim or desire except for the eternal
welfare of his own soul and for the souls of those around him</i> (McConkie,
<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, 121).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many years ago I read a 
		<i>New Era</i> article by Sister Barbara B. Smith, former President of the
General Relief Society. She described an amazing encounter she had with President Harold B.
Lee, who possessed this pure and perfect love. Sister Smith states:</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>One evening as I conversed with President Harold B. Lee, I said to him,
&#8216;President Lee, you seem different someway tonight.&#8217; He smiled and said, &#8216;You
know what it is, don&#8217;t you?&#8217; I shook my head and said I really didn&#8217;t know what it
was. Then he shared with me his remarkable experience saying:</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>After I became the President of the Church, I thought a great deal about what the
Lord wanted me to do. One night, while I was sleeping, President McKay came to
me in a dream. He pointed his finger and looked at me with those piercing eyes of
his as only President McKay could do, and he said, &#8216;If you would serve the Lord,
you must love and serve his children.&#8217; I awakened with a compelling desire to
learn all I could about love that I might serve the Lord.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>He said, &#8216;After I had read everything the scriptures had to say about love, I began
to put into practice all that I had gleaned from my study. That&#8217;s what you can
feel. It is my newfound ability to truly love and serve his children.&#8217;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>I watched President Lee even a little more closely that night and noted that not
one person who came to the table to shake his hand left without receiving a
special word of encouragement or an extra question that indicated the concern of
the prophet. No one went away without seeing his smile or hearing his words of
love </i>(Barbara B. Smith, &#8220;Love is Life,&#8221; <i>New Era</i>, Feb. 1986, 44).<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A year or two after President Hinckley was called to be the Prophet, we had a member of the
Seventy and his wife visit our home here in Rexburg. We asked this couple a question: &#8220;What
have you observed about President Hinckley since the mantle of prophet has fallen on his
shoulders?&#8221; They both agreed&#8212;his increased capacity to love. We have all felt President
Hinckley&#8217;s love, haven&#8217;t we?<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I suggest that the ability to possess this love or charity towards all is not just reserved for
prophets. The visiting teaching message in July 1999 states: <i>&#8220;Charitable hearts do remarkable
works, and nothing will bring joy into our lives more completely than nurturing and acting upon
the Christlike feelings that prompt us to do good&#8221; </i>(&#8220;Clothed in Charity,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign</i>, July 1999, 55).<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Charity, the pure love of Christ, is a gift we must seek after through study, prayer, obedience,
and sacrifice. We must pray this heartfelt prayer everyday, &#8220;Lord, please make me an instrument
in thy hands.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Spencer W. Kimball once said:<i> &#8220;God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is
usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each
other&#8221; </i>(<i>Ensign,</i> Oct. 1985). Brothers and sisters, we must seek to be angels of charity and mercy
for our Savior as we minister to each other through our works of righteousness.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In conclusion, I would like to share with you a conversation I had on the phone many years ago
with a stranger, not of our faith. I am not sure why this woman called me, but she expressed
concern about our belief and teachings that works are important to our salvation. She said she
could not believe that we would preach anything other than salvation by grace. As we visited
together, she alleged that for me to think my good works did anything for my salvation
diminished the gift that Christ had given us through His grace and showed that I was ungrateful
for the gift&#8212;because it was just that, a gift. Christ expected nothing in return.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I informed her that our Church teaches that salvation comes only through the Atonement of
Christ. Anything I did in the way of good works was not going to save me. It was Christ&#8217;s
atoning blood that saves. But I told her that after I exhibited faith in Christ, repented, was
baptized, and then received the gift of the Holy Ghost, I had a desire to love Him, to serve Him,
and to glorify and honor His name by doing good. Our works are an outcome of following His
directive to be &#8220;doers of the word, and not hearers only.&#8221; We demonstrate our love for Him by
keeping His commandments, and we show our faith by our works. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The woman then said it was wrong for me to feel I had to do anything in the way of good works.
Our conversation ended. I am not sure I understood her very well, and I know she did not
understand me.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I pondered our conversation, I came to the conclusion that many times we, as Latter-day
Saints, do not teach or emphasize or articulate very well the primary role the Savior plays in our
salvation. We are so intent on trying to prove ourselves by our good works that we forget to rely
wholly upon the merits of Him who is mighty to save (see 2 Nephi 31:19). We talk of works, yet
we fail to talk of Christ, to rejoice in Christ, or to preach of Christ (see 2 Nephi 25:26). We get
discouraged and burned out thinking that we can never do enough to repay him. And the reality
is we cannot repay him. His loving and merciful gift to save is perfect grace; it is infinite grace;
it is eternal grace that only our Savior and Redeemer can provide. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">But His grace is unique in that it not only redeems us from sin and saves us from everlasting
death, it also provides strength and assistance to do good works that we otherwise would not be
able to maintain if left to our own means (see Bible Dictionary, Grace, 697). His grace enables
us, magnifies us, and strengthens us as we seek to honor Him who created us and redeemed us.
Understanding the dual nature of this grace engenders our <i>faith</i> in the Savior; it gives us 
		<i>hope</i> in
His atoning sacrifice; it fills us with <i>charity</i>, His perfect love; and ultimately it blesses us with
strength to do good works.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, I testify that Jesus is the Christ. He reveals His will to living
apostles and prophets. I have come to know this truth in an even more personal way the past 18
months&#8212;that whether by His own voice or the voice of His servants, it is the same. Therefore,
faith to follow the teachings of living prophets helps us to abound in good works. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I testify that temple attendance brings blessings of peace, personal assurance, and spiritual power
in a world that grows increasingly dark. Receiving temple covenants gives us hope for eternal
blessings and through that hope we obtain strength right now to cope with trials and challenges. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;I bear witness that charity towards all is the pure love of Christ. May we pray with all the energy
of our hearts for this marvelous gift&#8212;to feel our Savior&#8217;s pure and perfect love and then share
that love with others. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May we someday hear these precious words from a loving Savior: 
		<i>&#8220;Come unto me ye blessed,
for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth&#8221;</i> (Alma
5:16). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Three decades ago, my husband and I made the mad dash to the hospital in the middle of
the night. I was in early labor with twins. They were due April 10<sup>th</sup> but this was February
10<sup>th</sup> &#8211; cold and blustery. Like most expectant mothers, I worried that my child, in this
case children, would be born with all their fingers and toes. Would they look like their
Dad or me? Would they have hair or be bald? (I was bald until I was three.) I never
worried that my child might die. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Immediately following the emergency delivery, doctors stabilized the boys and then
whisked them away to a specialty unit in another hospital. They couldn&#8217;t breathe and as
further diagnosis progressed, there were many more problems. They were identical; each
weighed only three pounds and was about the size of my hand. Christian was born first;
Cameron seven minutes later.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My husband had been alone through the night with the boys at the hospital across town.
He and a physician had administered to them and by the power of the priesthood had
called upon the heavens that they might live. They made it through the night. But as the
morning progressed, reports of their critical condition stacked up and seemed
overwhelming. Our first-born child, Christian, faced odds seemingly insurmountable. My
husband asked if there was someplace he could go to be alone. Ushered into the doctor&#8217;s
office in the Intensive Care unit, he knelt down to talk to our Father in Heaven. He told
him how badly we wanted those little sons. How long we had waited for them. How he
appreciated the Lord honoring the blessing given that enabled both to live. But then, with
all the strength he could muster, he put them in the Lord&#8217;s hands: <i>&#8220;Not my will but thine
be done.&#8221;</i></span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He walked from the room to the isolette just as the monitor on Christian&#8217;s heart flattened
out. He died that fast. I had never held him while he was alive. Come, the Lord beckoned.
Come home. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember those days as if they were just last week. I remember the lights in the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit and the sound of the machines sustaining life, buzzing
intermittently with alarms. I remember the looks on the faces of other worried young
fathers and mothers and the notes they wrote on their cribs, the pictures of family they
tacked on the clear walls of the little isolettes. We covenanted then that if the Lord would
save Cameron we would serve with devotion, we would hearken to every call. In the
months that followed, Cameron fought valiantly for his life astounding the doctors with
the grit he could muster from his frail little frame. Today Cameron is 30 and in a medical
residency in Kansas City training to save premature babies.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Come. The Lord has said to his people. Come unto me. Come ye that labor and are heavy
laden. Come. He has drawn us out of the world one by one since ancient times with the
call. Come. Think of the times already in your young lives when you have been drawn in
His direction. <i>&#8220;Blessed are those who come unto me.&#8221;</i></span><br />

finally submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in
God's will, then we are really giving something to Him! It is the only
possession which is truly ours to give!</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Such a remarkable teaching of how we become like Christ. In the Garden of Gethsemane
he wondered if there were some other way, <i>&#8220;if possible, let this cup pass from me&#8221;

Lord said, but then, with full purpose of heart he continued, <i>&#8220;Not my will but thine be

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us much about yielding our hearts to God. I think about
the experience of Liberty Jail. It was a dreadful place: dark, damp, and dirty. Did Joseph
shake his fist at the sky? Did he holler, &#8220;What did I do to deserve this?&#8221; Have we asked
that question in much lesser circumstances? </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This was a man whose whole life was focused on the will of God. Joseph turned to the

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Often, we turn to this section in the Doctrine and Covenants, to make sense of suffering
or draw strength for our own difficult days. We read the litany of challenges Joseph
faced: <i>&#8220;If fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness and all the
elements combine to hedge up the way&#8221;</i>; and this one &#8211; <i>&#8220;if the very jaws of hell shall

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In other words, you have yielded your heart to God, now don&#8217;t falter. Joseph had come
unto Christ with full purpose of heart. Now, his charge was to hold that course. He was to
hold not only to the iron rod but the virtues being shaped in his soul. He could not risk
becoming like his captors &#8211; harsh, impatient, hardhearted and vindictive. He had to
follow the example of the Savior and hold on to the goodness inherent in him. So must
we. </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I love Liberty Jail. I love the shabbiness of the scene. The walls are rough stone; the
ceiling so low Joseph couldn&#8217;t stand straight up, the jailers were crass and belligerent.
The scene was so below the majesty of the prophet of God. But the circumstances did not
define Joseph any more than our circumstances define us. You may be single and wish
you were married, an average student and you dream of being at the top of the class. You
may be missing your mother&#8217;s home cooking or the rigor of the mission field. You may

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Last October I was sitting at my computer on a Tuesday afternoon. Life was good.
Looking out my window I could see the grass being rolled into place for our new home. I
could see where the flowers would bloom each spring in the beds. My books filled the
bookcases and the windows looked up at the mountains. We had been in our new home
only two months. My husband had been released from callings that required that we live
in the same neighborhood all of our married life. I was musing about our new life on a
quiet cul de sac, it was smaller than the rambling 100 year old house where we had reared
our children.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And then the phone rang. It was my husband saying that one of the apostles wanted to
meet with us the next day. My heart stopped. I didn&#8217;t ask why. I didn&#8217;t need to. It was
fall; The Brethren were beginning to talk to potential mission presidents. The situation in
my mind edged precariously close to the Lord&#8217;s words to the young man, <i>&#8220;Sell all that
thou hath and follow me.&#8221; </i>Not now, I thought. We just built our house. This wasn&#8217;t just a
new house. It was a dream put on hold for thirty years. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let me back up. My husband and I had moved from 5 years of apartment living in central
Salt Lake to house sitting on the north bench with a beautiful view of the valley while my
brother-in-law finished a graduate degree in the East. We had purchased a lot just a few
blocks away and plans for our house were out for bid. We would build our new home and
move in when my brother-in-law returned in the spring. We were just waiting for my
husband to be released from his calling in the bishopric of our old ward when we
received a phone call inviting us to meet with the stake presidency the next night. We
thought it curious. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;What could they call you to do? I asked. &#8220;Not serve on the High Council, that&#8217;s just for
old men. And anyway, we&#8217;ve moved.&#8221; I still remember walking in and sitting down. The
Stake President looked at us. Asked about our precious little baby home from the hospital
and weighing nine pounds at nine months. And then he turned to my husband and called
him to serve on the high council. My jaw dropped. &#8220;We&#8217;ve moved,&#8221; I thought to myself.
He looked at me and said, &#8220;I know you&#8216;ve moved. I am asking you to move back. The
Lord needs you here.&#8221; Back to a stake where few people owned homes; where the buses
and fire engines were your neighbors. &#8220;Someday&#8221;, the stake president said, &#8220;you will
build that house&#8221;. Come. We sold the lot, and moved back. </span></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Thirty years later the promise of the stake president was fulfilled. We had a new home.
But note, he didn&#8217;t say how long we would get to live there. </span>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The interview last October culminated in a call from the First Presidency for my husband
to preside over the England London South Mission. Come. Leave your house &#8211; no
different than leaping over the side of the boat. This July, we will walk on English soil.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I did not grow up as a member of this church. I did attend church on Sunday with my
parents and was active in Sunday school and had youthful responsibilities in the Sunday
services. Prayer was not a part of our family life but I did learn that attending church was
important. When I visited a farm in Iowa, Alvin, the head of the house, would place his
elbows on the table and bow his head to bless the food at dinner. He would fold the
fingers of one hand over the fingers of his other hand without interlocking his fingers and
humbly pronounce the prayer. One of Alvin&#8217;s hands was unique. He had gotten a new
electric saw for the machine shed and one day as he was working he noticed that when he
picked his hand up, two and a half fingers stayed on the work bench. So these were the
shortened fingers I remember seeing when he folded his hands in prayer. I was six or
seven when I began going out to the farm to spend the night and remembered that his
prayers were an act of being respectful and being grateful for the bounty they enjoyed on
the farm. I must have liked what I saw to remember it so many years later.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When I was about 12 years old, my father retired and decided to move to Florida. After
arriving in Florida and beginning junior high school, we continued to attend church every
Sunday. While in high school I became a member of the church we had been attending
along with some of my friends. When we graduated from our religious education classes,
we all received a &#8220;red letter&#8221; Bible. These scriptures were neat because they had a zipper.
The Bible occupied a place in my room but remained zipped up - so the pages would not
get dusty, you understand! I knew then there was a higher power but that was as far as it
went. I didn&#8217;t really understand the explanation of God that I was taught. The few times I
remember offering prayers were when I was in crisis (now - &#8220;crisis&#8221; for a high school
boy then was breaking up with his girl friend!). I know this is

unpopular war, and questions of racial inequalities. John Glenn orbited the moon, African
Americans were not allowed to eat in the same restaurants as whites, racial tension was
high particularly in the South. Rosa Parks quietly protested on a bus seat. Martin Luther
King, Jr. marched to Washington, D.C. The Beattles came to town. Diana Ross and the
Supremes were hot. Cassius Clay was boxing and Cesar Chavez was protesting for better
treatment of California grape pickers. Bob Dylan sang, &#8220;The times, they are a changin&#8217;.&#8221;
John F. Kennedy saw a bright future for America. Woodstock offended adults with their
music, drugs and &#8220;free love.&#8221; It was a decade of turmoil. Yet, at the same time, a new
visitors&#8217; center opened on Temple Square and the Choir performed at the World Fair in

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After graduating from college, I married my sweetheart and enlisted in The United States
Army Band in Washington, D.C. Our first child was born. When it came time to get a
babysitter, we searched the band for someone&#8217;s sister that could babysit. This is the time
when good members of the Church started showing up in our lives. We consistently
asked Janene Forsyth, an exceptional young lady (Miss Teenage America) who would
not come on Monday evenings or drink the cold beverages we had in the refrigerator for
her. She was the beginning of many bright examples we would treasure during our seven
year introduction to the lives of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. &#8220;The Tremendous Power of Example&#8221; began to work in our lives.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The seventies led us to graduate school at the University of Iowa. Wouldn&#8217;t you know it
&#8211; our babysitter for the three years there was a Primary President. Our son, Arthur, joined
their then eight children (eventually ten) and became part of their family and part of their
ward. We, the parents, were on the outside looking in on a wonderful transformation of
the wards newest &#8220;Sunbeam.&#8221; Arthur would come home and tell us he was special and
wanted a duty in the house! We did NOT know what to say or do &#8230; except be impressed.
Remember the earlier quote from Richard L. Evans?</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We wanted these values in our little family. We were still experiencing turbulent times
being on a college campus. We were just beginning as parents and didn&#8217;t have a clue how
to continue. We watched and absorbed the Aamodt family&#8217;s activities. They eventually
gave us a family home evening manual. We didn&#8217;t know what the D&amp;C thing meant but
we did sit down together on Sunday evening, pop some popcorn and watch &#8220;The
Wonderful World of Disney&#8221; each week. Our babysitters became stability in a time if
uncertainty.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We observed this family for three years. They took us to their daughter&#8217;s baptism, the
yearly children&#8217;s sacrament program, a dessert auction, and to Nauvoo to see the &#8220;City of
Joseph&#8221; pageant. We attended the ward so infrequently (once or twice a year) that we
were introduced as &#8220;Arthur&#8217;s parents.&#8221; </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While in Nauvoo, the testimonies of the missionary couples impressed Scarlett and
questions arose as to how these couples could leave their families. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you miss your
grandchildren? &#8220;You <span style="text-decoration: underline">can&#8217;t</span> go home and see them for how long?&#8221; &#8220;Why do they always
end their speeches with &#8216;I know these things to be true&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Is this something they&#8217;ve
memorized?&#8221; During the return trip to Iowa City, we asked, &#8220;So, where are those gold
plates now?&#8221; WHERE? (we thought&#8230;) Well, that&#8217;s convenient! This trip was a definite
turning point in our interest in the church even after we were told where those plates
ended up.</span><br /></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Before graduating, I became ill and needed blood. Members of the ward donated blood
while the Aamodt family moved us into their home.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After graduating from the University of Iowa we ventured out of the United States to
Bogota, Colombia, where I had accepted a position in La Orquesta Sinfonica de
Colombia as principle clarinetist. After being there one week we left our apartment to
visit the Sears store. While returning to the apartment, we saw two Americans on the
opposite side of the street wearing white shirts and ties. (What a good example). We
approached them and asked about the church. Elders Bob Mellor and Stanford Vaterlaus
were glad to see us and speak some English. This was in the fall of 1974. </span>

discouraging. We&#8217;re running out of references and investigators. One of
our good families out in Esmeralda kind of told us good-bye. He said he
knows (his church) isn&#8217;t right and the Mormons have a lot more going for
them but, at his age, why change. He said he&#8217;d keep reading the Book of
Mormon so all wasn&#8217;t lost. So yesterday afternoon as I was feeling a little
low &#8211; we were making member visits &#8211; not finding a soul home. Then, here
comes the most Mormon-looking young couple with their boy walking
toward us. He said, &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t happen to speak English, would you?&#8221;</i></span></font></p>

it. The Elders at Branch 5 couldn&#8217;t believe how &#8216;golden&#8217; they were. I
really wanted to teach them but I think one of the Branch 5 office pairs
would be better, working with the members and all, since they&#8217;ll be going
to that branch. I guess it&#8217;s not really important who teaches them but that
they hear the Gospel and I feel the most effective way to do it would be
with Branch 5 Elders. We asked them about the &#8216;charlas&#8217; Sunday and they
said they wanted to wait a week to get settled. I can&#8217;t blame them. So, I&#8217;ll
call the office this week and tell them to start the &#8216;charlas&#8217; with them,

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Because these members I have mentioned had shown us how to live in the world but not
of the world, we wanted to contact each of them after we had been baptized. We did our
best to notify all of them. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our babysitter, Janene Forsyth, was lost to us for many years until we met a couple in
Grand Rapids, Michigan, while we were on tour with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and
Orchestra at Temple Square, who knew the family and sent us her address in California.
Last month, after 37 years, we met her in San Jose. What a happy reunion. </span>

The missionaries invited them to attend church. The following day the

introduced them to a new set of Elders working in that branch and after

to travel all the way to Colombia to find the LDS church. They now live in
Rexburg, Idaho where he is a professor at BYU-Idaho. He has served as a
bishop twice and been in a stake presidency. He also plays in the
Orchestra at Temple Square. Their son has served a mission (in
Colombia, Cali) and they adopted a Colombian girl who served a mission
in Utah (Provo). They were so excited to tell their story and see the Elder
who had taught them the discussions (and had baptized them). Their only
disappointment was that they never knew the names of the first Elders they
met who took them to church. Through the years they had asked the Elders
that baptized them and they couldn&#8217;t remember. The couple only
remembered that one of them had red hair. </i></span></font></p>

walking down the street with my red-haired companion when this couple

After they told their story I later went up to them and introduced myself. I
was quite surprised at how happy they were to see me. I had felt that I had
played such a significant role. As we recounted the events of those two
days and the good people they had met over the years that had prepared
them to hear the gospel we both got teary eyed. What wonderful people!
She related to me that the Elders who taught them didn&#8217;t know the
discussions in English and had to use their books to help them as they
taught. Their whole lives had changed since joining the church. Many,
many people had prepared them over the years by little acts of Christian
love and charity. Then came the right moment and circumstances when

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I feel it a wonderful honor to be asked to address you in a devotional. My wife, Kathryn,
is here with me today. I am grateful that she is at my side now and always. She has been
my ever faithful better half for nearly 44 years. She is my advisor, confidant, and best
friend. I am profoundly grateful for the gospel which has been a central part of our lives
together and which provides the promise of an eternity together with our family.

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I asked a trusted colleague for some advice on giving this talk. He thought for a few
moments and then wrote on a piece of paper, folded it, and handed it to me without
saying anything. On the front of the note, as you can see if you are close enough, is
written one word: &#8220;Socrates.&#8221; When I opened the note I read his sound counsel:
&#8220;Socrates gave long speeches. Socrates was poisoned by his friends.&#8221;</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">On Sunday, we, with the rest of the Christian world, will celebrate Easter and
acknowledge and remember the Savior&#8217;s Divine act in overcoming physical death. As
Latter-day Saints our Easter remembrance of the Savior&#8217;s emergence from the tomb of
Joseph of Aramethia is richly informed and enlarged by latter-day revelations.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Latter-day Saints are familiar with the singular role of the Savior in the grand plan by
which the children of God progress from premortal existence, to mortality, and to life in
the eternities. In the premortal council, Jesus Christ was the advocate for our Father&#8217;s
plan of agency, repentance, love, justice, mercy, Atonement, and eternal progression.
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">He, the first born of our Heavenly Father in the Spirit, who was a God already, was the
volunteer who condescended to come to earth and perform the necessary Atonement
which was absolutely essential to the Father&#8217;s Plan. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has observed
that: <i>&#8220;Never has one person offered so much in so few words&#8221; </i>as the Savior did when he
said, <i>&#8220;Here am I, send me&#8221;</i> (Abraham 3:27). He is the Creator of heaven and earth and
all that is in them. He is the only begotten Son of our Heavenly Father in the flesh. His
was the one and only perfect life in mortality which could qualify as the essential sinless
sacrifice on the eternal alter to compensate for the sins of His less-worthy brothers and
sisters. He was the perfect example and unmatchable teacher whose gentle invitation bids
each of us to <i>&#8220;. . . come unto me and be ye saved. . .&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 12:20). We know that he
is our advocate with the Father (see Doctrine and Covenants 110:4) and is our perfect
judge (see 3 Nephi 27:16). </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">You and I know that through His divine grace, Jesus&#8217; Atonement unconditionally
compensates for Adam and Eves&#8217; transgression in the Garden of Eden and overcomes
mortal death for all mankind. Through the Atonement we have the hope of eternal life
with our Father in Heaven by our individual repentance and through His Atonement
which can satisfy the demands of justice. The scale of these monumental achievements is
unmatchable. The Savior&#8217;s Atonement is the single greatest event in the history of
mankind. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, <i>&#8220;. . . the Atonement of Jesus Christ 
		</i>[i]<i>s the
central act of all human history&#8221; </i>(Ensign, May 1997, p. 12). </span>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">From the upper room the disciples and Jesus walked to the Garden of Gethsemane. The
Lord left them and went alone into the Garden to pray and to begin the miracle of the
Atonement. There, his suffering was so great that He sweat great drops of blood
(Doctrine and Covenants 19:18). Then came Judas, with a great multitude of men who
were armed with swords and staves; and Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">By the testimony of false witnesses He was condemned to die. To placate the priests,
Pilate had the Lord whipped and then delivered Him to be crucified. And Jesus was silent
as they mocked Him. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Forced to carry the cross until he could do so no more, to Calvary he was taken, where
the Roman soldiers pierced his hands, wrists, and feet with nails, thus affixing his body
to the cross. There he hung in a constant agony, derived from pain, thirst, and derision,
with no one to comfort him or relieve his anguish of body, mind, or spirit. <i>&#8220;My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; </i>(Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34). Then after one last
lonely experience with the suffering begun in the Garden Gethsemane, he cried with a
loud voice, saying<i>, &#8220;It is finished. Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit&#8221; 
		</i>(<i>see</i> Luke
23:46 and John 19:30). </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The Lord Jesus Christ had died for all mankind. His mortal life and the mortal ministry
were ended.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">We do not know how the Atonement satisfies the requirements of justice. As Elder
Packer has said, <i>&#8220;How the Atonement was wrought, we do not know. No mortal watched
as evil turned away and hid in shame before the light of that pure being&#8221;</i> (Ensign, May
1988, p. 69). But we do know that the Atonement unconditionally compensates for the
original sin of Adam and Eve and overcomes the physical death of all mankind. And that
on the condition of repentance it satisfies the demands of justice for our individual sins.

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I am reminded of an experience with one who learned for himself how absolutely
essential the Savior is in the process of repentance I first met Bill after his
disfellowshipment from the Church, he was trying to come back. Although not raised in
the Church, Bill had become a member as a mid-teenager. Now, years later, he is a fine
man, well educated, married in the temple, with a growing family of small children, and
serving faithfully in a leadership position in the Church. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Bill described to me his difficult journey to true repentance. He told me of the deep
sorrow he felt after he had seriously sinned. He knew he had violated sacred covenants
which were essential to his eternal sealing to his family. He loved his children and his
wife. At first he believed he could keep his sin a secret. He had a testimony of the gospel
and believed in the Savior, but somehow Bill had come to think that he could personally
and privately work out his repentance. In the long weeks and months following his sin,
Bill would occasionally awaken in the middle of the night in a cold sweat with a feeling
of indescribable despair. The same feelings persisted in times when he was alone or in
private contemplation. He always felt in those dark hours that all was lost, but he
concluded in his heart to take his chances at the bar of judgment, rather than inflict the
pain on his family their knowledge of his selfish, sinful act would cause.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#160;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">As Bill poured out his heart to me, I thought of Alma the Younger who had spent his
early life in disobedience to God&#8217;s laws and in opposition to the Church. Alma&#8217;s
description of his feelings upon realization of what he and done paralleled Bill&#8217;s, 
		<i>&#8220;But I
was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and
racked with all my sins&#8221;</i> (Alma 36:12). And in verse 15, <i>&#8220;Oh, thought I, that I could be
banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in
the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Under Satan&#8217;s influence, Bill had concluded in his mind that if 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">he</span> punished 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">himself</span>
enough while at the same time continuing to fill his church obligations, surely he would
be forgiven. Bill told me of his love for running, and how, in order to punish himself, he
would run for hours at a time, up steep hills and down, until he reached a state of total
exhaustion, convinced that if he experienced enough pain he might be forgiven. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Bill&#8217;s loving father, who was not a member of the Church, could see that Bill was greatly
troubled. Although not aware of Bill's specific problem, his father recommended,
arranged , and paid for counseling which they both hoped would give Bill some comfort
and peace. But even with counseling, there were always those terrifying moments when
Bill knew what he had done would cost him everything. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Finally, after months of painful, but futile, attempts to overcome the effects of his sin by
himself, Bill sought help from his friend, the Branch President. From that moment to the
day I first met Bill months later, he had felt a growing sense of relief. At first it was hard,
very hard. When Bill was disfellowshipped, his church leaders provided loving help for
him and his wife. Over time, Bill had fully and gratefully given up his sin and returned to
Christ.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#160;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Bill wept openly as he expressed to me his love for his wife and family, for his Church
leaders, and most of all for the Savior. Bill had come to realize that no act of his alone
would atone for his sin. The only price which would ransom his soul had been offered in
Gethsemane and Calvary by Jesus Christ. Divine forgiveness could only come through
Bill's humble acceptance of Christ&#8217;s unmatchable offer. And the process of repentance
had worked its miracle for Bill. The miracle of forgiveness.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>&#8220;Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord,

		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Some variation of Bill&#8217;s experience has been a part of the lives of all who have found the
pathway to that same forgiveness by accessing the peace of the Atonement through real
repentance. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Besides the tragic error in the denial of the essentialness of the Atonement in our
lives illustrated by Bill&#8217;s story, there is another kind of rejection of the sacred
Atonement which is a favorite tool of Satan. It is the notion, indulged in by some,
that it is OK to sin a little here and there, or that some time other than now will be a
better or easier time to repent. </span></font></p>

little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy
neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow
we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few
stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God</i> (2 Nephi
28:7-8).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The attitude that we can sin a little (if no one else is really harmed) without meaningful
consequence, or that some other time will be a better time to repent, denies the necessity
of the Atonement and runs the risk that we will yield our eternal agency to Satan.

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Those who engage in these rationalizations risk everything. For no one can know at what
point in our continued sinning we will become sealed to Satan. The privacy of our
sinning, or the belief that no one is really harmed by our sinful behavior, provides an
especially dangerous environment wherein Satan&#8217;s power can overcome us. Of particular
concern in this regard is the use of pornography to satisfy lustful appetites. Our prophets
have repeatedly warned of the dangers of this addicting practice. The risks are so high
and the consequences so grave that no one should indulge in rationalizations to begin or

repentance. A stake president will write, &#8220;I feel he has been punished

disobedience and precedes repentance. A husband will write, &#8220;My wife

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">President Kimball taught that we cannot repent and be forgiven of our sins without fully
cooperating with God in helping us attain Eternal Life ( The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.
2).</span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Repentance is not just stopping something wrong or starting something right. Repentance
has to do with our hearts and minds as well as our actions. Elder Burton explains that the
Hebrew word for repentance means to <i>&#8220;turn back to him </i>[Heavenly Father] 
		<i>&#8211; to leave
unhappiness, sorrow, regret, and despair behind and turn back to your Father's family,
where you can find happiness, joy, and acceptance&#8221; </i>(Ensign, August 1988, p. 7).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Repentance is a process of turning our attitudes, desires, and actions toward God, and
when our hearts are pure and we are willing to do whatever God wants us to do, we are
repentant and, therefore, forgiven. President Kimball taught: </span></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>Repentance must involve an all-out, total surrender to the program of the
Lord. That transgressor is not fully repentant who neglects his tithing,
misses his meetings, breaks the Sabbath, fails in his family prayers, does
not sustain the authorities of the Church, breaks the Word of Wisdom,
does not love the Lord nor his fellowmen. . . . God cannot forgive unless
the transgressor shows a true repentance which spreads to all areas of his
life </i>(The Miracle of Forgiveness, p. 203).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">This does not mean that the Lord expects us to live perfect lives, but he does expect us to
want to become perfect and to try to do it. When we do everything we can do, placing the
Lord first in our lives and continually repenting in order to improve, the Atonement of
Jesus takes effect in our lives. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The process of repentance is the process of becoming. It is a change within us that is then
mirrored by our actions. After King Benjamin had taught his people:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>They all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which
thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth,
because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty
change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil,
but to do good continually </i>(Mosiah 5:2).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">These people went on to say that they were willing to do God's will all the remainder of
their days. They were not yet perfect, but they desired to be so and were willing to work
for it; therefore, they were repentant and were forgiven of their sins. They had turned
their hearts and efforts toward God, and were willing to cooperate fully with him in
becoming celestial people. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants teaches that celestial people are those who are
valiant in their testimony of Jesus, and explains that they are just men made perfect
through Jesus the mediator. Thus, even our best efforts will not be enough to perfect
ourselves. All of us are dependant upon the Savior. </span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">In Nazareth, Jesus read to the people from Isaiah, 
		<i>&#8220;the Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and the recovering of sight to the
blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised&#8221;</i> (Luke 4:18). The Old Testament reveals
this additional prophetic language regarding Christ's mission: <i>&#8220;To appoint unto them that
mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness&#8221;</i> (Isaiah 61:3), and then Jesus said,

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">This broad declaration of the mission of Jesus clearly suggests that the Atonement had a

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The sorrows and trials of this life are not all the result of our personal fault. Indeed,
probably most of them are not. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Along the continuum of our sorrows and adversities lie some which are the result of our
deliberate sins, some which are caused by unwise choices which are not sinful, others the
result of hasty judgments, and still others which are the product of circumstance for
which we have absolutely no responsibility. Yet, regardless of the degree of our
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">responsibility</span> for the bad things that happen in our lives, we feel the sorrows and
suffering, and taste the bitter taste, whatever its source. And the pain and bitterness we
feel, whatever its source, can destroy our peace, break our hearts, and separate us from
God. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">When the bitterness we feel is caused by sin, we always lack the power to fully overcome
its effects alone. And when we are without fault, we so very often lack the personal
power to compensate for all of the harmful effects of such bitter events. And when we
find ourselves distanced from God in circumstances we have not created nor have moral
responsibility for, I believe the Atonement can work to heal our spirits and return us to
God &#8220;as one,&#8221; just as effectively as it can when we repent of our sins and return to God
"as one" through the power of the Atonement.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I have known many whose lives are burdened by choices which were not &#8220;sinful,&#8221; but
were unwise, or who must deal with overwhelming sorrow caused by accident, or illness,
or by the acts of others. Sometimes these burdens and sorrows can cause the sufferer to
separate themselves from God, or even to blame God for their pain. I am convinced that
the hope which is the promise of the Atonement is as much for those who suffer in these
circumstances as it is for the repentant sinner. Some, sometimes feel that their activity in
the Church and their commitment to obedience to the commandments ought to somehow
shield them from the pains and sorrows, even sicknesses, of mortality. But the
Atonement does not shield us from all of the sorrows, pains and sicknesses of mortality.
Rather it provides access to strength beyond our own capacities to deal with the
heartbreaks that are inevitably a part of our lives. </span></font></p>
<p>

to the family of Adam&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 9:21). Elder Neal A. Maxwell has said of this scripture,<i>
&#8220;Since not all human sorrow and pain is connected to sin, the full intensiveness of the

such help was to give us both a reason and a way to improve, an incentive

sinner. For Jesus is willing to take up the cross of every person who is willing to give
themselves to Him. What makes the Atonement so incomprehensibly magnificent to me

compensates and heals those who suffer because of innocent circumstances of mortality.</span><br />

to the commandments of God brings freedom, happiness, and peace of soul. Further, it is
my experience that disobedience inevitably leads to unhappiness, bondage, and a
troubled spirit. I know that the Atonement has real power which can be manifest in us
through the miracle of forgiveness, and through strength bestowed upon us in adversity,
trials, and illnesses. I know that our Savior loves me and you. He is our Redeemer,
Comforter, and Guide. He lives. He has broken the bonds of death. He is my brother and
most trusted friend. We are lead by prophets. President Hinckley is a living prophet,
whom I love with all my heart and whose counsel is inspired of God. The Book of
Mormon is true. I am forever grateful for the Gospel in my life, and especially for the
abundant wondrous blessings in my life which come from the Atonement of our Savior. I
pray for the very best in life for each of you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Have you ever received a gift so wonderful that you couldn&#8217;t wait to share it with
someone else? The prophet Enos had such an experience when, after praying all day he
finally received forgiveness of his sins. Could there be a better gift? After realizing
Christ&#8217;s love for him his attention then turned to a concern for the welfare of his brethren
the Nephites and finally he prayed for his enemies the Lamanites. Enos had a desire to
share the love of Christ that he was feeling with those around him. This pattern of
coming to understand Christ&#8217;s love for us and then sharing that love with others is the
theme of my remarks today. Turn with me to John 13: 34 and 35. This is a familiar
scripture to most of us.</span></font></p>

		<i>&#8220;As I Have Loved You&#8221; </i>in your minds?
According to the Savior himself, we become his disciples by loving others as He has
loved us. I am convinced that the single element that will improve not only your
experience here at BYU&#8211;Idaho but also your life in general is to learn to love others as
Jesus loves you. We refer to this love as charity or<i> &#8220;the pure love of Christ.&#8221;</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How is it that Jesus loves us? I feel that when the Savior came upon the Earth he had
three missions: the most important element of His earthly ministry was atoning for our
sins and understanding our struggles, second, relieving the suffering of those around him;
and third his teaching. Pure love motivated all three aspects of his mission. 
		</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Of course, the ultimate expression of Christ&#8217;s love for us is his atonement. His suffering
for us and his willingness to give his life so that we can overcome the fall and our own
shortcomings is his greatest example of love. Although we cannot fully comprehend the
depth of His suffering, we must strive to be more familiar with and deepen our faith in
the atonement. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some time ago I counseled a student who struggled with self-harm behavior. As I tried to
understand why she felt compelled to cut herself she described to me that she felt
unworthy as a person and that she felt that she needed to be punished for her
unworthiness. She could not identify any specific reasons that she was unworthy; she
could only convey a nebulous sense of not measuring up. This student expressed a belief
in the atonement, but she felt that it didn&#8217;t really apply to her. I was struck by her lack of
understanding of the personal nature of the atonement of Jesus Christ. Let&#8217;s turn to Alma
7:11-12:</span></font></p>

every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will
take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i></span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death
which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his
bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know
according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their
infirmities.</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Can you internalize what this scripture means to you personally? Each of us must
personalize the atonement and change our testimony from knowing that Jesus is 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">the</span>
Savior to knowing that Jesus is <span style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> Savior. Understanding that Jesus willingly suffered
for my sins, died for me, and that he experienced all my pains and all my sorrows helps
me feel he loves me and he knows me and he understands me. In Lehi&#8217;s dream, the tree
and fruit that Lehi described as <i>&#8220;filling him with joy&#8221; </i>represents the love of God. The
love of God is most perfectly manifested in Heavenly Father sending his son to suffer
and die for us. <i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life </i>(John 3:16). The
tender relief that comes with being forgiven of our sins is the essence of our Savior&#8217;s
love for us. Isn&#8217;t it interesting that as soon as Lehi experiences the love of God by tasting
the fruit, his first desire is to share that love with others? As we more fully realize the
personal love involved in the atonement we should be increasingly motivated to love
others more completely. We can be instruments in God&#8217;s hands in bringing His love and
the love of His Son to His children.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The second element of Christ&#8217;s mortal ministry that exemplifies his love for us is his
effort to serve. Feeding the five thousand, raising Jairus&#8217; daughter from the dead, and
blessing little children are all examples of his love. He extended his love and mercy to
the crippled man at the pool of Bethesda when he said <i>&#8220;rise, take up thy bed, and walk&#8221;
		</i>(John 5:8); to the woman taken in adultery when he encouraged her to, 
		<i>&#8220;go and sin no
more&#8221; </i>(John 8:11); and even to his crucifiers when he begged; <i>&#8220;Father forgive them for
they know not what they do&#8221; </i>(Luke 23:34). The examples of his love and kindness go on
and on. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In 1 Nephi the phrase 
		<i>&#8220;the tender mercies of the Lord&#8221; </i>is used to describe Christ&#8217;s on-going love for us. I believe that Christ wants to use each of us to extend his tender
mercies to God&#8217;s children. On the second floor of the Kimball building is a quote by
Spencer W Kimball that I love. It states <i>&#8220;God does notice us, and he watches over us.
But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore it is vital that
we serve each other.&#8221; </i>Are we being that person that extends Christ&#8217;s tender mercies to
those we come in contact with? Similarly, Joseph B. Wirthin has stated, <i>&#8220;Love is the very
essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In this church, prayers for help are often answered
through the simple, daily service of caring brothers and sisters. In the goodness of
genuine friends, I have seen the reflected mercy of the Lord Himself.&#8221;</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is humbling to consider ourselves as Jesus Christ&#8217;s instruments in bringing relief to our
neighbors, but what great blessing we can find in this service.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the third element of Christ&#8217;s mission, his teachings, there is a recurring theme of love.
The parables of the prodigal son, the Good Samaritan, and the lost sheep and, wisdom
like <i>&#8220;in as much as you have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
unto me&#8221;</i>, are just a few of His well known teachings on the importance of loving others.
When Jesus was asked which was the greatest commandment, he gave the familiar
response that is found in Matthew 22: 37-40:</span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Did you notice that both of these two greatest commandments begin the same;<i> &#8220;thou
shalt love?&#8221; </i>Neal A Maxwell said that developing love for others is essential to obtaining
eternal life. <i>&#8220;Developing charity is clearly just as essential for admission to the upper
realms of the Celestial kingdom as is baptism. We are to be more than merely nice,
rather we are to be &#8216;full of love&#8217;.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Perhaps you are like me and find commandments that demand more attention to the letter
of the law (such as parts of the Word of Wisdom or paying tithing) easier to follow than
ones that require more focus on the spirit of the law (such as possessing charity). My
grandfather struggled with the Word or Wisdom. He could not seem to give up his
morning cup of coffee. But Grandpa was one of the most charitable, service-oriented
people I have ever known. Sometimes I am afraid I will fall into a false sense of security
by thinking &#8220;I&#8217;m doing OK, I am living the commandments&#8221; because I am following the
more straight forward laws but overlook the importance of more enigmatic laws like
loving my neighbor. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Besides my grandfather, I have had many wonderful examples of loving as Jesus loves in
my life. My father died when I was a young boy. Through my early years, other men
stepped in to provide love and examples to help compensate for the loss of my father. I
think of Bishop Aaron Angel, a small man in physical stature but a giant to me, as he
extended love and thoughtfulness to me as an awkward teenager. Another was a great
young men&#8217;s leader and home teaching companion, Wayne Parkinson. At first we young
men all looked up to Wayne because he had a cool car and a beautiful wife, but gradually
I looked up to Wayne because I knew that he cared about me and took time out of his
busy life for me. I also had an older college roommate when I attended here who
extended love to me as a pre-missionary. Brad would wake me up so that I could get to
our priesthood meeting that started early each Sunday. I regret that I wasn&#8217;t always
appreciative of Brad&#8217;s efforts at the time, but I look back on his efforts with a grateful
heart. Some of these efforts may seem minor to you; but they made a difference in my
life then and inspire me still to look for opportunities to serve others. Of course the most
profound example of love in my life, short of the Savior himself, has been my dear wife
DeeAnn, who loves me so selflessly and unconditionally. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We know that we are to love others, but too often our behavior may actually be a
reflection of a more Cain-like attitude of &#8220;am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; Some obstacles
that I am aware of in my own life that keep me from being more charitable are: a selfish
attitude, being distracted by worldly cares, a judgmental disposition and, fear. Perhaps
you can relate to some of these weaknesses. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we are not careful our own priorities and issues, though worthwhile, may blind us from
opportunities to reach out to others. Someone once said that the enemy of the best is the
good. We can spend our life doing good and still not be the instrument that Heavenly
Father intended us to be.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt">&#160;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A classic experiment in social psychology conducted at the Princeton Theological
Seminary in the early 70&#8217;s illustrates the natural tendency to choose selfish priorities over
others&#8217; urgent needs. Seminary students were to prepare a sermon on the &#8220;Good
Samaritan&#8221; and then told to go to another building on campus to have their sermon
recorded. Unbeknownst to the seminary students, a man was placed on the route between
the two buildings, slumping in a door-way&#8212;looking to be in obvious need of help. What
would you guess was the crucial variable that predicted how likely a seminary student,
ready to preach about the &#8220;Good Samaritan&#8221; was to stop and help a person in distress?
The deciding variable was neither their age, nor how &#8220;religious&#8221; the student was, as rated
by classmates. Instead it was how much of a hurry the student was in. The students had
been divided into three categories. The first group was told they were late for the
recording session and would need to hurry to make it. The second group was told they
had just enough time to make the recording session; and the third group was told that
they had a few moments to spare. The study found that the students who had time to
spare were most likely to help the man in distress. Of those in a hurry, only 10% stopped
to help the man in need. Those who were hurrying to make their recording session were 6
times <span style="text-decoration: underline">less</span> likely to stop and help. Even with the lesson of the Good Samaritan freshly on
their minds, the students were in too much of a rush to help someone in need. Sadly, I&#8217;m
not sure I would do much better in those circumstances. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley addressed this dilemma of making time for others in a devotional
speech to BYU students in 1995:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>I know that you are engrossed with your studies. This is important, but in
a sense it is a selfish pursuit. Take a little time, now and again, to reach
out beyond yourselves to help others. There are those around you,
students in need of a little kindness, a little attention, a little appreciation.
My dear young friends, give expression to the noble desires that lie within
your hearts to reach out to comfort, sustain and build others. As you do
so, the cankering poison of selfishness will leave you, and it will be
replaced by a sweet and wonderful feeling that comes in no other way.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Selfishness is the opposite of charity and must be eliminated if we are to develop true
Christ-like love. Neal A. Maxwell has counseled:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>So often what people need so much is to be sheltered from the storms of
life in the sanctuary of belonging. Such a service cannot be rendered by
selfish people, however, because the response of the selfish will always be
that there is no room in the inn. Chronic self-concern means that the &#8220;No
Vacancy&#8221; sign is always posted. Frequently we busily search for group
service projects, which are surely needed and commendable, when quiet,
personal service is also urgently needed. Sometimes the completing of an
occasional group service project ironically salves our consciences when,
in fact, we are constantly surrounded by a multitude of opportunities for
individual service. In serving, as in true worship, we need to do some
things together and some things personally.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Reaching out to others can put us in a vulnerable position. What if our attempts to be
kind or helpful are rejected? When we fear rejection, we might take courage by looking
to the Savior, whose mercy is often not accepted, and yet he &#8220;stands at the door and
knocks&#8221; ready to love those who will receive Him. Mormon knew the antidote to fear as
he tells us: &#8220;<i>I fear not what man can do because perfect love casteth out all fear&#8221;
		</i>(Moroni 8:16).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another stumbling block to the development of charity can be a judgmental attitude. We
may feel that the person has brought upon themselves their difficulties, or we may feel
that they are not deserving of our compassion. King Benjamin warns against such
judgments in Mosiah 4:17-19:</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As we overcome some of these natural-man tendencies that blunt our development of
charity, and as we endeavor to be more loving, we will be blessed with improved
spirituality and an increased capacity to love.<i> </i>Elder Cuthbert has stated:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Over the years many people, especially youth, have asked me, &#8216;Elder
Cuthbert, how can I become more spiritual?&#8217; My reply has always been
the same: &#8220;You need to do more service.&#8221; Service changes people. It
refines, purifies, gives a finer perspective, and brings out the best in each
one of us. It gets us looking outward instead of inward. It prompts us to
consider others&#8217; needs ahead of our own. Righteous service is the
expression of true charity, such as the Savior showed.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In addition to overcoming these obstacles to charity, we might be more loving by
considering at least the three following emphases:</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">First of all, we can focus more on the atonement. Once again, Enos was an example of a
strong desire to understand the atonement. He described his desire as a<i> &#8220;wrestle &#8230; before
God&#8221; </i>(Enos 1:2), and he said that his father&#8217;s teachings <i>&#8220;sunk deep into my heart&#8221;</i> (Enos
1:3), and that his <i>&#8220;soul hungered&#8221;</i> (Enos 1:4). Even after being forgiven he wondered
		<i>&#8220;Lord, how is it done?&#8221; </i>(Enos 1:7). What a great model for us to follow in striving to
make the atonement more real in our lives. Could similar words describe our search for a
deeper understanding of the atonement? I know that I could make better use of things that
we have already been provided to help us to <i>&#8220;always remember him.&#8221; 
		</i>The weekly
ordinance of the Sacrament is designed to help us remember Christ&#8217;s sacrifice. My use of
that reverent time could greatly be improved. We could also improve our focus on the
scriptures, which are designed to testify and instruct regarding the Savior. In Lehi&#8217;s
dream it was the iron rod, which represents the word of God that led Lehi to the tree and
fruit which represent God&#8217;s love. Studying the scriptures and the teachings of modern
day prophets will help bring us to Christ. The reason that we refer to the Book of
Mormon as another testament of Jesus Christ is that if we read it with real intent it can
bring us closer to Christ and to an understanding of His love for us. Worshipping more
regularly in the temple also helps us focus more on the atonement. I need to take more
time to ponder the love Jesus has for me and for my brothers and sisters.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Secondly, we can reflect on the service and love that we have received from others and
be inspired to reach out to those around us. I remember as a youth getting a phone call
before school on my 17<sup>th</sup> birthday from Bishop Angell. The conversation was very brief,
but I still recall being impressed that he would think to call me and wish me a happy
birthday. I am trying to repeat that thoughtfulness as a bishop now, almost 30 years later.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Finally, charity is a gift from God that we must earnestly seek after. We should pray that
we will be aware of those who could use our help and we can pray for the courage to act
in those situations. Let us follow Mormon&#8217;s admonition in Moroni 7:48, &#8220;<i>Pray unto the
Father with all the energy of heart, that we may be filled with this love, which he hath
bestowed upo</i></span></font></p>

according to mine everlasting gospel, <span style="font-weight: bold">should gather together, and stand in holy
places</span></i> (Doctrine and Covenants  101:22, emphasis added).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The stakes of Zion, the temples of the Lord, our chapels, and our homes are the holy places in
which the Lord commands us to stand. But what does it mean to &#8220;stand in holy places?&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the years ahead we will live in a world of increasing turmoil, growing temptation, and
gathering wickedness. Some of what challenges us will be very subtle; some will be very direct
and immediate. But no matter the challenge, the disciples of the Savior will be steadfast and
immovable in their commitment to Him. In Ephesians, chapter 6, Paul admonishes the Saints to
arm themselves with the gospel of Christ in the battle against evil <i>&#8220;. . . and having done all, to
stand&#8221; </i>(Ephesians 6:13). To stand in this sense is to resist, to not fall, to not succumb to the
wiles of the devil, nor his fiery darts. This is what that great Apostle meant when he admonished
the Corinthian Saints to <i>&#8220;. . . stand fast in the faith . . .&#8221;</i> (1 Corinthians 16:13) and the Saints in
Philippi to <i>&#8220;. . . stand fast in the Lord . . . &#8221;</i> (Philippians 4:1). The Lord&#8217;s disciples in the latter-days will be true and faithful to the covenants they have made. They will stand fast. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here is something very concrete and practical you can do to stand fast in holy places: every
Sunday as you partake of the sacrament, prayerfully renew your commitment to always
remember Him and keep His commandments. Reflect on your gratitude for the Atonement, on its
power in your life, and your need for the blessings and strength that are in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Then, if you live close to a temple, follow the example of President Heber J. Grant (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of
the Presidents of the Church: Heber J. Grant</span>, pp. 54-55) and go to the temple every week where
you can participate once again in the covenants and ordinances of the House of the Lord. If you
do these things, the Lord will bless you with His Spirit. Your strength will be in the Lord. Your
house will be built on the rock of Christ. And you will stand fast in holy places.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Disciples built on the rock of Christ will stand when the storms come. But they must also be
active and engaged in standing for truth and righteousness and bearing testimony of the truth.
Alma declared that one of the great responsibilities of discipleship is: &#8220;<i>. . . to stand as witnesses
of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death . . .</i>&#8221;
(Mosiah 18:9).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You can stand as a witness of God through the words you speak. The Lord has given His
disciples this great commandment with a promise:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into
your hearts . . . .</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall
say</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 100:5-6).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Here are some practical steps you can take to lift up your voice. First, be prepared to share the
message of the Restoration with the people you meet. Study and learn the first missionary
discussion in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Preach My Gospel</span>. Make sure you know the five-minute version very well.
Second, ask the Lord to put people in your path and promise Him that you will speak to them.
When He does, share your love of the Church and the gospel and teach the principles of the first
discussion if the opportunity comes. Invite them to read the Book of Mormon, to come to
Church, and to meet with the missionaries. If you will pray for opportunities and prepare
yourself to share and invite, you will have many wonderful experiences as a witness of God. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Standing as a witness of God also comes from what you do. When you live the fullness of the
gospel, your actions illuminate and reflect your faith in Christ and your love of His gospel and
His church. As the Savior proclaimed in the Sermon on the Mount and in the revelations of the
Restoration, you become the light of the world: </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And also unto my faithful servants . . . and unto all the elders and people of my
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, scattered abroad in all the world;</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard
for the nations </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 115:3, 5).<br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Letting your light shine is all about standing in holy places. Here the Lord commands His
disciples to arise&#8212;to stand up&#8212;and having stood, to shine forth, to stand as a witness in word
and deed. The Lord taught the Nephites about light and the standard to the nations when He said:
&#8220;<i>Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye
shall hold up&#8212;that which ye have seen me do&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 18:24). 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The standard is Christ. He is the light and the life of the world. The people of the world see that
standard through the lives of His disciples who stand in holy places. In your life, they will see
the light that is in Christ in your homes, in your wards, in your stakes, and in your service in the
temples of the Lord. They will see and feel the light that is in Christ because they will see it in
you. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here is a practical suggestion to help you arise and shine forth: no matter where you go, no
matter what you do, let the principles of the gospel guide your actions. It does not matter if you
are working on a farm or in a hospital, a school, a business, an office, or at home. It does not
matter if you are at church, or at work, or out in your neighborhood. Put true principles into
action. Live your life whole; be the same person wherever you are. When you have opportunities
to teach, teach true principles&#8212;no matter what. The light that is in you will shine through true
principles in action. You will be a light to the world, and you will stand in holy places. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In conclusion, I would like to leave you with a summary, a request, and my testimony. By way
of summary, I hope you will always remember to renew your covenants in the sacrament and in
the temple, faithfully, every week; be a great missionary&#8212;prepare, pray, share and invite; and let
your light shine by putting true principles into action in everything you do. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here is the request: when you leave here today, please take the Spirit of Ricks with you. Please
take BYU&#8211; Idaho and what it means and what it stands for with you. You now represent the
university. I hope and pray that wherever you go, whatever you do, you will act in such a way
that people around you will see in you the principles, the purposes, and the spirit of BYU&#8211;Idaho.
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, this is the work of our loving Heavenly Father. His Son, the Lord
Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. This is His church and kingdom. We have the great
privilege to stand as His disciples in this the dispensation of the fullness of times, ushered in
through the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I bear witness that Gordon B. Hinckley stands
where Joseph stood. He is the prophet of God. Your future is bright and glorious. May the Lord
bless you and keep you all the days of your life. And may you stand in holy places and be not
moved. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><b><font color="#000080" size="5">Heart to Heart: Engaging the Scriptures in the Service of the Lord</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Brigham Young University Women&#39;s 
		Conference</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">May 3, 2006</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br /></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Early one morning in the fall of 1968 I knelt in prayer in a small basement apartment in
Boeblingen, Germany. I had been a missionary in Southern Germany for less than two months;
and I was confused, worried, and discouraged. The work was hard; few people wanted to talk to
us; and some heaped on us anger, scorn, and ridicule. I felt under attack on all sides, and I did
not have all the answers. I had searched and pondered and had tried to find understanding and
greater faith, but I had made little progress. And so, there I was on my knees pleading with the
Lord for help. As I prayed, I heard in my mind, as though someone had spoken to me, these three
words: believe in God. I looked up and looked around. My companion was fixing breakfast. I
asked him if there was a scripture that said, &#8220;Believe in God.&#8221; He said, matter-of-factly, &#8220;Yeah,
Mosiah 4:9.&#8221; I opened the Book of Mormon and read these words: &#8220;<i>Believe in God; believe that
he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom,
and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things
which the Lord can comprehend.&#8221; </i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As I read those words, the message from the Lord&#8212;have faith and trust in me&#8212;sank deep into
my heart. Hearing those words and reading that scripture was a defining experience. I learned to
trust the Lord, to hear His voice, and to see the scriptures as a source of inspiration and power. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have here in my hand one of the greatest of all the blessings the Lord has given us. I love the
scriptures. Each of us has the opportunity to read and search them and to 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">engage</span> them in our
service in the kingdom. I know the scriptures are important to you, and I pray that the Holy
Ghost may be with us today to teach us how the scriptures might become an even greater source
of truth, knowledge, and power in our lives. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">There is no better statement of that power, and how one obtains it, than Mormon&#8217;s description of
the sons of Mosiah in Alma 17:2-3:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared
unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what
added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had
waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound
understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might
know the word of God.</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting;

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The sons of Mosiah engaged the scriptures through the observance of four principles:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">1. Make and keep sacred covenants with the Lord.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">2. Search diligently to know the truth.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">3. Fast and pray to have the guidance of the Spirit.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">4. Teach with power and authority.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I call these principles the &#8220;framework of engagement.&#8221; As we consider them, please pay close
attention to the way each principle deals with our hearts. Engaging the scriptures is not primarily
a matter of cognition or intellect. It is primarily about our hearts. The framework, therefore, is an
engagement of the heart. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Principle #1: Make and Keep Sacred Covenants with the Lord</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The connection between making covenants and engaging the scriptures lies in our hearts.
Throughout the scriptures the prophets have used the image of the heart to capture what is at the
very core of our emotional and spiritual life&#8212;our innermost desires, our central drives, our
deepest emotional commitments, and our capacity for love. This is what we give to the Lord
when we make and keep sacred covenants with Him. Our hearts become His, and He writes the
promises in our hearts. The promises of the covenant shape our desires and become our defining
commitments. Through the power of the Atonement He gives us a new heart, with desires and
commitments that are pure before Him. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is not something that happens all at once. But if we are true and faithful, if we 
		<i>&#8220;. . . </i>[yield]
<i>to the enticings of the Holy Spirit . . .&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 3:19), the Lord works a mighty change in our
hearts. Hearts that are turned to the Lord with desires and commitments defined by sacred
covenants are open to His word and His light. Here is the promise:<i> &#8220;And if your eye be single to
my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and
that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:67).<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Principle #2: Search Diligently to Know the Truth</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To engage the scriptures, we must read them and search them. Since the days of my mission I
have read the scriptures every day. But there came a time a few years ago when I realized that I
needed to do much more than I was doing. I made a commitment to the Lord that I would get up
earlier and really dig into the scriptures with intensity and focus. It has been a wonderful
experience. Let me share with you what I have learned. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">First, if you do not have a copy of 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Preach My Gospel</span>, please go and get one and use it. It is
inspired and powerful. You might also find Elder Gene Cook&#8217;s wonderful book 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Searching the
Scriptures</span> useful in your search. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Second, here are my practical ideas for searching the scriptures:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Set aside time&#8212;the same time&#8212;<span style="text-decoration: underline">every</span> day.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Begin with prayer.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Use whatever approach feels best&#8212;read, cross-reference, mark.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Listen for the Lord&#8217;s voice, His message to you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Write down impressions and ideas.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Pray about the impressions that come.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#8226;Act on the impressions you receive.<br />
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have had some wonderful experiences searching the scriptures. But of all that I have learned,
the one thing that has deeply changed how I think about and use the scriptures is this: when I am
really searching, no matter what the topic, the search leads me to Christ. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus said,<i> &#8220;. . . I am the way, the truth, and the life . . .&#8221; 
		</i>(John 14:6). When we search the
scriptures to find the truth, we are searching for the Savior.<i> </i>In that search we use our minds, but
we will only find the Savior and His truth if we also listen and feel with our hearts. Nephi taught
Laman and Lemuel this principle when he said, <i>&#8220;. . . ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel
his words; . . . . why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts?&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 17:45-46).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">With a heart and mind open to the Spirit, we search to understand and feel His words and hear
His voice. I know the Savior speaks to us through the scriptures. When we read and ponder
under the direction of the Spirit, we receive very personal guidance and instruction from the
Lord. Like the disciples on the road to Emmaus, our hearts may <i>&#8220;. . . burn within us . . .&#8221; 
		</i>as He
speaks to us and <i>&#8220;. . . </i>[opens] <i>to us the scriptures&#8221; </i>(Luke 24:32).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Herein lies the power of writing down what we learn in our searching and pondering. Indeed, the
Lord has commanded us to obtain His word and to treasure it up in our hearts (see Doctrine and
Covenants 11:21, 26). When we write down what we receive and review it and pray about it, we
make it our own. When we truly hear and feel the voice of the Lord and treasure it in our hearts,
we reinforce our covenants, deepen our desire to do His will, and strengthen our commitment to
serve Him.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Principle #3: Fast and Pray to Have the Guidance of the Spirit</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fasting is an ancient practice in which we humble ourselves, set our face to the Lord (see Daniel
9:3), and yield our hearts to God (see Helaman 3:35). In Joel 2:12-13, the Lord powerfully
underscores this connection between fasting and our hearts:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and
with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God:
for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness . . . .</i><br />
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fasting, with prayer, is thus much more than going without food. It is a small sacrifice; but if it
comes with purpose and commitment, it is acceptable of the Lord. When we fast with a purpose
in Him&#8212;or turn our faces to the Lord, and yield our hearts to Him&#8212;there is a cleansing power
in that sacrifice that engages and shapes the desires and commitments of the heart. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here is an analogy: Imagine an automatic garage door that will not open. You look and find that
the infrared light receptor is dirty and misaligned. The light signal, and thus the circuit, have
been interrupted so the door will not open. You clean the receptor, align it with the source of
light, and the door works. Fasting and prayer are like cleaning and aligning our spiritual light
receptors. Through fasting and prayer we open ourselves more fully to the ministry of the Holy
Ghost&#8212;and, thus, to receive light and truth in our search of the scriptures. If we keep those
receptors clean and aligned, we may then say of our search for the things of heaven, as Alma
said, <i>&#8220;. . . for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the
spirit of revelation which is in me&#8221; </i>(Alma 5:46).<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we fast and pray and invite the Holy Ghost into our search for truth, the Spirit will teach us
what we need to know and do. We will receive guidance for our families and our callings in the
work of the Lord. If we are consistent in our fasting and prayer, and if we always remember
Him, the Holy Ghost may be our constant companion. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Principle #4: Teach with Power and Authority</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Every call in the Church is a call to teach. When we serve in the Lord&#8217;s kingdom, we teach. It is
true in our families, in the Relief Society, in every part of the Church. This is the sacred purpose
for engaging the scriptures: we search to know the truth so that we might serve and teach more
effectively in the kingdom. And it is our privilege to teach with power and authority of God. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listen to these words of the Lord to Hyrum Smith in Doctrine and Covenants 11:20-21:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your might,
mind and strength.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your
tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea,
the power of God unto the convincing of men.</i><br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here the Lord teaches us that there are two sources of 
		<i>&#8220;. . . the power of God unto the convincing
of men.&#8221;</i> The first is the Spirit. The Lord promised Hyrum, and promises us, that if we are
obedient and work hard to obtain the words of Christ,<i> &#8220;. . . then shall your tongue be loosed;
		</i>[and] <i>. . . then . . . you shall have my Spirit.&#8221; </i>With the power of the Holy Ghost, we may speak
the words of Christ <i>&#8220;. . . with the tongue of angels . . .&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 31:13). Indeed, the Spirit
carries those words unto the hearts of those who hear (see 2 Nephi 33:1) and bears witness that
the words are true (see Doctrine and Covenants 100:7-8). What is taught is powerful because it is
taught by the Spirit. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The second source of power is the word itself. Paul taught in Hebrews:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints
and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart </i>(Hebrews
4:12).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The words of Christ penetrate into the mind and heart with force and depth. Paul describes them
as sharp, powerful, and quick&#8212;or living. When the Lord speaks, His words are perfectly adapted
to the needs of those who hear. They strike at the very heart of the issues and concerns and hopes
and dreams that people have. Thus, the word of God discerns the thoughts and intents of the
hearts of those who hear. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Teaching with power and authority of God is all about the heart. If there is a desire in our hearts
and if we have treasured the word in our hearts, the Lord will give us<i> &#8220;. . . in the very hour, yea,
in the very moment, what ye shall say&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 100:6). Thus, what we teach
touches the hearts of those who are prepared because we speak His words with His power. We
teach with power and authority when we teach heart to heart. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Framework of Engagement: Two Stories</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Engaging the scriptures with these four principles brings marvelous promises: hearts that are
His; hearts that know and treasure His voice; pure hearts, filled with the Spirit; the capacity to
serve and teach heart to heart. This is the framework of engagement. But it is also the cycle of
engagement. As we search and teach, we learn. When we receive<i> &#8220;in the very hour&#8221; 
		</i>what we
should say, we gain insights that reinforce our desires and commitments and that send us back to
the scriptures to seek deeper understanding. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I know these principles and promises are true. I have seen them in action in the lives of people
close to me, and I have experienced them in my life. In the last nine months, Sue and I have had
the great privilege of serving at BYU&#8211;Idaho. On that campus we have many opportunities to
teach, and we have put the framework of engagement into practice. I would like to close today
with two stories from our experience. <br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The first story is about the talk Sue gave last January in the first devotional of the winter
semester. As she always does, she poured her heart and soul into that talk. She felt impressed to
talk about the Christmas star. She fasted and prayed and searched the scriptures. In that search
she connected the star to the Savior through a verse in 2 Peter and one in Revelations:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day
star arise in your hearts:</i> (2 Peter 1:19)</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things . . . . I am the root
and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</i> (Revelations 22:16)</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">These passages connect the dawn with the morning and the Savior with the day star, the bright
and morning star, that can arise in our hearts. These are beautiful passages, but the Lord had
something more for Sue. Early one morning she woke up with two phrases going through her
mind. I know this because she woke me up to tell me about them. Here are the phrases she
received: &#8220;The day star will only rise in hearts that are pure,&#8221; and &#8220;our hearts are purified only
through the Atonement of the Savior.&#8221; Those were the insights that completed the talk the Lord
wanted her to give about the star, the Savior, and our hearts.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">On the day of the devotional, just before she stood to speak, one of the members of the faculty
sang a special musical number. Without any consultation with us, he chose to sing 
		<i>The Light
Divine</i>. As he sang so beautifully, Sue and I looked at each other. We knew the Lord had blessed
her with one of His tender mercies. She had a witness that He was aware of her talk and wanted
her to know of His love and His blessing upon her words. She stood and taught heart to heart.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The second story is about an experience I had in a memorial service in February for a young
student from Albania who was killed in a terrible car accident. As I prepared for the service, I
read the fifty-seventh verse of section 138 in the Doctrine and Covenants in which the prophet
says that faithful elders who depart this life continue to preach the gospel in the spirit world. I
knew that scripture described that young man. He had returned from his mission just a few
weeks before he died, and he was a great missionary. I decided to talk about that scripture in my
remarks.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I was the last speaker. Each of the four speakers before me talked about what I had planned to
say. We had all had the same spiritual impression. I leaned over to Sue and whispered, &#8220;What am
I going to talk about?&#8221; Meanwhile, a young sister in the front of the chapel had been overcome
with a great spirit of sadness and wept almost uncontrollably. She was one of the last people to
see this young man alive. There was a strong sense of sadness and grief in the chapel.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Just before I stood to speak, two thoughts came into my mind: Doctrine and Covenants, section
42, and the early part of section 138 where the spirits of the just rejoice together in the hope of
the Savior&#8217;s resurrection. So I stood and read these verses in section 42: 
		</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of
them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious
resurrection.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it
shall be sweet unto them; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 42:45-46).<br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I read those words, I saw for the first time that we are commanded to weep&#8212;but not for those
who die; death is sweet to them. We are commanded to grieve so that we may learn to live
together in love, so that we may learn to support and comfort one another in the loss of those we
love. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I then read these words from section 138:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>All these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection,
through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together
because the day of their deliverance was at hand</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
138:14-15).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In that very moment, the Lord taught me this principle: we have the same hope on this side of the
veil as they had then on their side. The glorious message to all who grieve, to all who weep for
the loss of a loved one, is that He lives! And because of Him, we, too, may look forward and
rejoice in the hope of a glorious resurrection&#8212;just as they did. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The young woman who wept so sadly grew quiet just a few seconds after I began to speak. As
the Holy Ghost taught us that evening, there came into that chapel a sweet spirit of peace and
hope. It was a wonderful experience, a gift from a loving Heavenly Father. I know that in those
moments the Spirit taught heart to heart.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I would like to close today with my testimony about you and about the promises the Lord has
given us if we will engage the scriptures in our lives.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">One day not long ago I sat in the Idaho Falls Temple pondering this talk. There came into my
mind a clear impression of the power in the sisters who would be sitting here today. I know that
power. I have seen it in Sue, the love of my life; in my daughters; the wives of my sons; my
sister; my grandmothers; my sweet mother. I have known them and seen them, and I have seen
you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have seen you in your homes nurturing and teaching children, grandchildren, nieces, and
nephews. I have seen you in Relief Society, Primary, and Young Women&#8212;teaching, serving,
saving lives. I have seen you share the gospel in word and deed in your neighborhoods and at
work. I have seen you visiting sisters and families, healing body and soul. I have seen you in the
temple, serving in the presence of the Lord. I have seen you nurture and love, teach and inspire,
organize and lead. I have seen you do all these things clothed in power and glory, filled with the
Spirit. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">There is a marvelous work before you. It is His work. This is His Church and kingdom. I bear
witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. His light and His voice are in the
scriptures. His invitation is to all: <i>&#8220;. . . Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him
that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely&#8221;
		</i>(Revelations
22:17).<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">May God bless us all to engage the scriptures with full purpose of heart that, like the sons of
Mosiah, we might serve and teach in the kingdom of God with power and authority, heart to
heart. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</font></p>

that Jesus is the Christ and that through the gift of the Holy Ghost we can feel His presence in
our daily lives.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Too often we dismiss some of the little miracles that happen to us as merely coincidence.
However, on closer examination, little miracles act as testimonies that the Savior is very much
involved in our lives. Then we know we are truly children of our Heavenly Father and He can be
with us. Mormon asked: </font></p>

<font color="#000080"><i>My beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into
heaven&#8230;? </i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Behold, I say unto you nay, for it is by faith that miracles are wrought.
Wherefore, if these things have ceased, woe be unto the children of men, for it is
because of unbelief&#8230;</i> (Moroni 7:27, 37).<br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Mormon said, <i>&#8220;Behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles and it is that same God who
created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are&#8221; </i>(Mormon 9:11).<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Heavenly Father is always a God of miracles because, 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;God is the same yesterday, today, and
forever, and in him there is no variableness&#8230;&#8221; </i>(Mormon 9:9).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">During the early days of the restoration there were many miracles; beginning with young Joseph,
when he was prompted by a passage from the Epistle of James. His prayer was answered and
miracles followed. They included the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the
establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As magnificent as these miracles are, personal miracles occurring in our own lives are important
to us. They teach us to trust in the Lord and have faith in him. These miracles come to us when
we recognize and heed the promptings of the Holy Spirit. He is a revelator, teacher and
comforter. He can lift our burdens and give us courage. He can have a calming effect on us. We
can be hopeful that the Spirit will &#8220;<i>enlighten our minds and fill our souls with joy&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 11:13).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In fact, the Lord said, 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;I will show miracles, signs and wonders unto all those who believe on
my name&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 35:8).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">May I share a personal experience about miracles? I do it humbly and not in the spirit of
boasting. Perhaps, as I share this experience, you can examine your own life with new eyes and
recognize your own personal miracles. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The personal miracle I speak of had its earliest beginnings with the Prophet Joseph. He
introduced the concept of constructing temples where sacred ordinances and instruction could be
received. You&#8217;ll remember the first temple was built at great sacrifice in Kirtland, Ohio. It was
completed and dedicated in 1836.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The saints had hoped to build additional temples; but, during the next few years, circumstances
prevented them from doing so. In 1839, the main body of the Church moved to a bend on the
Mississippi River known as Commerce. Now it is known as Nauvoo, meaning beautiful. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Under the direction of the Prophet Joseph, the Saints drained the swampland and created one of
the most prosperous and populous cities in the state of Illinois. That was a big miracle.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The following year, plans were underway to construct a temple, a sacred House of the Lord. The
Prophet Joseph appointed Brother William Weeks as the architect of the temple. Yet it was the
prophet who gave significant instructions regarding the design of the building: 
		<i>&#8220;I have seen in a
vision the splendid appearance of that building&#8221;,</i> he said, <i>&#8220;and 
		</i>[I] <i>will have it built according to
the pattern shown me&#8221;</i> (BYU Studies 9 [Spring 1979]: 343).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">An official cornerstone laying ceremony was conducted on April 6, 1841.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In addition to their financial contributions, Church members also gave a tithe of their time &#8211; one
day in ten to working on the temple. Men labored in the construction areas and women sewed
clothing for the workers and provided food, as well as raiment.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Because of donated labor and the donation of many building materials, it is very difficult to
accurately calculate the cost of the six-year construction project. However, some estimate that in
the monetary value of the time, the temple cost in excess of $ 1,000,000.00. That was a very big
miracle!<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Portions of the temple were dedicated and used prior to its completion in the spring of 1846. The
first of several public dedication services for the Nauvoo Temple took place on May 1, 1846.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">An uncontrolled lawless element forced the Saints to leave Nauvoo, broken-heartedly, leaving
their temple behind. In October 1848, an arsonist destroyed the interior of the temple. In May
1850, a tornado knocked down one wall of the gutted structure and weakened the other walls.
They were eventually taken down. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now move forward with me almost 100 years. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 1937, ninety-one years after the main body of the Church left their beautiful city and headed
west, the Church purchased portions of the original temple site in Nauvoo. Over the next half a
century, other properties, formerly owned by the Church and its members, were purchased and
restored.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One day in early 1999, at the conclusion of a regular Temple Sites Meeting, President Hinckley
mentioned that he was very seriously considering rebuilding the Nauvoo Temple. He said
something like,<i> </i>&#8220;My father wanted to rebuild it back in 1946, when he was serving as President
of the Northern States mission. Father actually wrote a letter to the First Presidency and he was
turned down. Now you brethren, Elder Sorensen and Bishop McMullin and your associates, need
to find a way to reconstruct the temple. The plans we have in the historical department are
inadequate and incomplete.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In April 1999, President Hinckley announced the Church would rebuild the Nauvoo Temple on
the original site. He said, <i>"The new building will stand as a memorial to those who built the first
such structure"</i> (<i>Ensign,</i> May 1999, 89).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Groundbreaking ceremonies for the temple took place on October 24, 1999. 
		<i>"A sense of joy and
spirituality returned to the Temple Lot,&#8221;</i> wrote a newspaper columnist 
		<i>(Church News, </i>30
October 1999, 6).<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Traditional cornerstone ceremonies were conducted on November 5, 2000. Under priesthood
direction, prayers and talks were given on each of the four cornerstones. This tradition dated
back to April 6, 1841, the original Nauvoo Temple dedication date, in the days of the Prophet,
Joseph.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The dedication of the restored Nauvoo Temple commenced on June 27, 2002. It was the 158th
anniversary of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his faithful brother, Hyrum. The
limestone exterior of the restored temple is a near duplicate of the original temple, including the
design elements. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The restored building has six floors, circular stairs, and is crowned with an upright statue of the
Angel Moroni with the trumpet in his hand. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">This is a facsimile of the original Angel Moroni that adorned the first temple until it was
destroyed. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now I want to be more specific about the miracles in our lives.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the spring of 2001, the First Presidency invited me to dedicate a building on the beautiful
campus of Southern Utah State University in Cedar City, Utah. At the time, I was puzzled as to
why I would receive this assignment. I am not an educator by experience or training. I was not a
graduate of that institution, nor had I any previous association with the University. Nevertheless,
I went ahead with the assignment. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sister Sorensen and I were having breakfast with Brother and Sister Bennion, who, some of you
may remember, was president of this institution not so many years ago. The experience I am
about to tell you was spoken of by Sister Marjorie Bennion here on this campus several years
ago. I have collaborated with her and she has given me permission to make reference to some of
the following incidents: While at breakfast at the Southern Utah State University, Sister Bennion
said to me, &#8220;I understand you are the Executive Director of the Temple Department and there is
consideration being given to rebuild the Nauvoo Temple.&#8221; Before I could answer, Sister Bennion
continued, &#8220;I visit teach a less-active sister whose great grandfather was the architect of the
Nauvoo Temple. His name was William Weeks. Would you be interested in talking to her? I
think she could be helpful. She would very much appreciate making contact with an official from
the Temple Department of the Church. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I was delighted and excited. I explained to Sister Bennion that the Church had a few limited
drawings and plans from the original Nauvoo Temple. They came to the Church in a rather
unusual way. Let me explain. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 1948, Elder Vern C. Thackery and Elder Frank Gifford knocked on the door of Mr. and Mrs.
Leslie Griffith in the&#8230;town of Boron, California located in the Mohave Desert. It turned out that
the Griffiths were descendants of William Weeks. They were not members of the Church at the
time. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Their great grandfather, Brother William Weeks, had a misunderstanding with Brigham Young
regarding the design of the Salt Lake Temple. President Young insisted Brother Weeks yield to
the inspiration of the President of the Church. Brother Weeks left President Young&#8217;s office &#8211;
never to return again. He took the plans of the Nauvoo Temple with him. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">So, going forward all those years, the missionaries tracted into the Griffiths in 1948, who
happened to be descendants of Brother Weeks, and miracle of miracles, had possession of some
of the original plans of the Nauvoo Temple. According to Elder Thackery, he was driving an old
Ford with a rumble seat, which is a seat that can be hidden. They gave Elder Thackery the
documents and he put them in the rumble seat, closed it and forgot them. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sometime later, after the Elder was home in Heber City, Utah, he remembered the documents
and delivered them to the Historical Department of the Church. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now we turn to 2001 in Cedar City, Utah with President and Sister Bennion. Remember she
said, &#8220;I am visiting teaching the great-granddaughter of William Weeks. I think she has some
plans of the Nauvoo Temple. Would you please go and visit with her? Better still, why don&#8217;t I go
and bring her here? You can have lunch with her.&#8221; </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">She promptly left to retrieve the good sister and the architectural drawing. She came right back
with both of them. Sister Griffiths had in her hands the actual drawings of the Nauvoo Temple &#8211;
drawings the Church did not have. We quickly made arrangements for her to go to Salt Lake
City and present the last pieces of the puzzle, restoring all as it was at first. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Since the Church was driven from Nauvoo, think how many places those Nauvoo Temple
drawings must have been. Think of how many old trunks and covered wagons they were in, as
they crossed half a continent. Imagine them passing through the generations of the Weeks
family. Finally, 100 years later, consider two missionaries knocking on a remote door in the
middle of the Mohave Desert. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">All along Heavenly Father knew where those plans were. They weren&#8217;t lost to Him. His vigilant
eye was watching over them until the time came to restore them for His great purpose of
rebuilding the Nauvoo Temple in our day. In fact, his watchful eye is over all things in the earth.
Remember his purpose is &#8220;<i>to</i> <i>bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&#8221; 
		</i>(Moses
1:39). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He knows you and where you are. In the scriptures he refers to you as his sheep. He knows
where all of his sheep are. You in this audience today, he knows each one of you. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He knew the young Joseph Smith. He called him 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">by name</span> when he appeared to him in the grove.
He knows you by name, even though you may be lost or wander for a time, the Savior 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">knows</span>
you. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He said, <i>&#8220;I am the door of the sheep&#8221; 
		</i>(John 10:7, 27). <i>&#8220;&#8230; My sheep hear my voice, and I know
them, and they follow me.&#8221; </i>Some of you may wonder if you are following him as closely or as
carefully as you can. But the very fact that you are in this room today tells me that you are His
sheep.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">His sheep, brothers, sisters and friends, were present when Jesus was hanging on the cross at
Golgotha. We can imagine the anguish of those who loved Him, and were left standing afar off,
as He hung there. Jesus was their very hope for salvation. Perhaps they were asking themselves,
how could this be? How could He die, with Israel still not redeemed? How could this be
happening? It seems that all is lost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You will observe sooner or later, this same illusion comes to all of us in our lives. It is the
horrifying illusion that all is lost. Throughout the history of Christ&#8217;s people, they have
experienced a powerful type and shadow of Christ&#8217;s suffering in this way. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Yes, sometimes we feel despair; even abandonment by God. I am sure many of the early saints
of Nauvoo experienced these feelings as they were forced to leave behind almost everything:
their beautiful city, the martyred bodies of their beloved Prophet and Hyrum; and most of all, the
magnificent temple for which they had sacrificed so much. The Temple was the symbol that
breathed into them the hope of a glorious resurrection and eternal life in the world to come.
Indeed, all seemed lost, and much was.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Yet, 150 years later, Sister Sorensen and I and several members of our family were at the
dedication of a beautiful temple, the exact replica of what once was, in that beautiful city,
Nauvoo, being led by a Prophet of God, Gordon B. Hinckley. We were now a prosperous and
blessed people. His watchful eye had prevailed.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The terrible sacrifice and loss of those early saints made everything possible. In that moment,
when everything seemed lost, everything was actually being won. As real as the suffering was,
Heavenly Father was working in His mysterious way to bring to pass a great miracle. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we read of the crucifixion of the Savior&#8212;the scorn, the pain, the tearing of the nails in his
flesh&#8212;these are the pains of mortality. In times of spiritual chastisement, it seems we are
forsaken. When in our darkest hour we feel all is lost, the Savior is still working for our good. He
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">does work</span> in mysterious ways.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Even if we feel forsaken for a time, we can put our trust in Him and have faith that somehow a
glorious purpose will emerge bright and new, and perfect. He will bring to pass His purposes and
we will behold miracles, great and small. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Now, as your new Rexburg Temple rises in splendor and majesty, listen to the words of our
beloved Prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>I hope you use the temple constantly because you will gain the blessings that are
there that you cannot gain anywhere else on the face of the whole earth. The
temple stands as a monument for all to see. It stands as a statement that we as a
people believe in the immortality of the human soul. Everything that occurs in the
temple is of an uplifting and ennobling kind, and it speaks of life here and of life
beyond the grave. It speaks of the importance of the individual as a child of God.
It speaks of the importance of the family as the creation of the Almighty. It speaks
of the eternity of the marriage relationship. It speaks of going on to a greater
glory. It is a place of light, a place of peace, a place of love where we deal with
the things of eternity </i>(Taipei Temple Fireside; Taipei, Taiwan; 1996).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The Temple has always been associated with the presence of the Lord. &#8220;<i>And let them make me a
sanctuary; that I may dwell among them&#8230;and there I will meet with thee, and I will commune
with thee&#8221; </i>(Exodus 25: 8, 22)<i>.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and
do not suffer any unclean thing to come unto it, that it be not defiled, my glory
shall rest upon it; </i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p><font color="#000080">Most of you are living exemplary lives. You are our pride and joy. You are the great hope of the
Church and the world. When the time is right in your life, go to the Holy Temple and claim your
blessings. If there is anyone here today who is not worthy to go to the House of the Lord, who
feels despair in their life, I urge you to put your life in order so that the Lord can bring to pass
His great purposes for you; so that you, too, can reap the benefits of the glorious Plan of
Salvation, as you enter and partake of the unique and wonderful blessings of the Temple. 
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">For some within the sound of my voice, it may be a small miracle. To others it may be a large
miracle, depending on where you are along the path toward immortality and eternal life. But it is
always a miracle.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, Susan and I are delighted to be with you today. We always enjoy feeling
the special warmth radiated by the students, faculty, and staff here. It is especially agreeable to
be on campus when the weather is as warm and pleasant as you are. On days such as this, 
		<i>&#8220;hope
springs eternal!&#8221;</i> (Alexander Pope, <i>An Essay on Man</i>, l.95).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><b>Blessed Hope</b><i> </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I want to speak with you today about hope. Hope is among the most blessed of all gospel virtues.
I am reminded of a story President Packer told me about Sister and Elder Tuttle, a former
member of the Seventy. The Tuttles had stopped to eat at a restaurant owned by a Greek
proprietor who was struck by Sister&#8217;s Tuttle&#8217;s seemingly Greek profile. He said to them, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
buy you dinner if you can tell me the greatest thing in the world.&#8221; They thought about it and said,
&#8220;love.&#8221; The Greek man said &#8220;No. You can live without love. The greatest thing in the world is
hope. You can&#8217;t live without hope.&#8221; Knowing his immigrant background, they sensed that he
spoke from personal experience.<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Hope truly is a blessed condition. <i>&#8220;Were it not for hope the heart would break&#8221;</i> (Scottish
Proverb. Also attributed to Thomas Fuller). Yet it is also among the most neglected of Christian
virtues. We hear relatively few sermons on hope as compared to, say, faith or charity. Further,
unlike faith and charity, hope is seldom presented prescriptively, as a duty disciples need to
cultivate, rather than merely descriptively, as an attribute believers can enjoy. This, in spite of
the fact that both the Bible and modern revelation are replete with injunctions to hope, and in
spite of the acute shortage of hope in a world drowning in despair. I hope that my talk will help
us all embrace hope more fully and firmly, especially during dark hours when we may be
tempted to give in to hopelessness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is during such tribulation that hope feels most blessed and needed. The scriptures suggest that
tribulation not only calls <i>for</i> hope but can call <i>forth </i>hope. According to Paul: 
		<i>&#8220;tribulation
worketh patience, and patience, experience; and experience, hope&#8221;</i> (Romans 5:3-4). Here as
elsewhere in scripture, hope is closely paired with patience (Romans 5:4; 8:25; 15:4; 1
Thessalonians 1:3; Alma 34:41; Doctrine and Covenants 6:19). Likewise, hope figures as the
middle member in that great triad <i>&#8220;faith, hope, and charity.&#8221;</i> To understand hope, we need to
grasp its intimate interrelation with linked gospel principles such as patience, faith, and charity,
as well as apprehend its opposite, despair, and its antidote, the Atonement. So I shall speak of all
these interrelated principles today as we consider what scripture calls <i>&#8220;blessed hope,&#8221; 
		</i>which we
enjoy in and through the Lord Jesus Christ ( Titus 2:13). Such hope is indeed among the most
blessed of all gospel virtues. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">A Neglected Core Virtue 
		</span><span>&#160;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Hope is a core Christian doctrine. Traditionally, hope has been regarded as one of three so-called
&#8220;theological&#8221; Christian virtues: faith, hope, and charity. The theological virtues were thought to
be fully available only through God&#8217;s grace, as contrasted to the four &#8220;cardinal&#8221; or &#8220;moral&#8221;
virtues&#8211;prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude&#8211;which could be acquired by human effort
(&#8220;Cardinal&#8221; comes from the Latin for hinge (<i>cardo</i>). The cardinal virtues were thought to be
attainable by human effort; they are therefore evident among noble non-Christians. By contrast,
the theological virtues were thought to require superhuman infusions of grace and therefore to be
available in their fullness only to Christians. In addition to these seven virtues, medieval
Christianity identified seven &#8220;capital&#8221; virtues that were opposite to the seven capital or deadly
sins: humility vs. pride, liberality vs. avarice, brotherly love vs. envy, meekness vs. wrath,
chastity vs. lust, temperance vs. gluttony, diligence vs. sloth). <br /></font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The world thinks that the Apostle Paul invented this famous formulation &#8220;faith, hope, and
charity&#8221; in his First Epistle to the Corinthians. We know, however, that this triplet appears in
discourses by Amulek, Mormon, and Moroni, not to mention many times in the Doctrine and
Covenants (See 1 Corinthians 13:13; Alma 7:24; Ether 12:28; Moroni 7:1, 37-48; 8:14; 10:20-21; Doctrine and Covenants 4:5; 6:19; 12:8; 18:19). Modern revelation thus confirms that the
triad faith, hope, and charity, far from being Paul&#8217;s invention, defines an inspired gospel
grouping in all ages. We also learn from modern revelation that hope is a core doctrine if
considered separately as a single godly virtue. Fully a third of the scriptural references to hope
appear in modern revelation, and almost always they appear in theologically drenched contexts.
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I mention all this at the outset of my talk simply to establish that hope is a crucial concept both in
Christianity generally and specifically in the Restored gospel. So I was surprised a couple years
ago to discover that the LDS Bible Dictionary has no entry for &#8220;hope.&#8221; It has an entry for faith
and charity but none for hope. I am not sure why. Maybe the editors figured that everyone
already knows what hope is. After all, it is such a common little word and one which often bears
no special religious meaning&#8211;as in &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t have a quiz after Devotional today!&#8221; or &#8220;I
hope this talk ends soon.&#8221; Still, it strikes me as telling that of the three so-called &#8220;theological&#8221;
Christian virtues (faith, hope, and charity) only hope is left out of our Bible Dictionary. I fear
that sometimes &#8220;hope&#8221; is left out of the lexicon of our lives as well.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Hope and Faith</span><span>&#160;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Although hope often seems dwarfed by the towering theological terms that frame it, hope is not a
whit less important than its big sisters faith and charity, and in some respects is even more
demanding than its near twin, faith. Many Latter-day Saints find it comparatively easy to express
faith in the foundational truths of the gospel&#8211;that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph
was a prophet, and so forth. But to feel hope. . . . Well, here the Lord seems to be expecting
something rather more personal of us. For hope is more than belief in propositional truths. Hope
bids us not only believe but <i>feel</i>. It is an attitude of the heart more than of the mind. It is telling
that in English &#8220;hope&#8221; functions not only as a noun, like &#8220;faith,&#8221; but as a verb. Hope is the act of
a soul expectantly reaching out toward the future. Belief can attach itself to the past, the present,
or the future. Hope, by contrast, is oriented emphatically toward the future. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And not just to the future in general but to 
		<i>our own</i> futures. Hope focuses on deeply personal
possibilities about our own lives rather than on impersonal facts. As we all know, it is possible to
believe wholeheartedly that God&#8217;s purposes will prevail and yet lack what the scriptures call a<i>
&#8220;lively hope&#8221;</i> that the Lord&#8217;s purposes will prevail in our own lives or in the lives of our loved
ones (1 Peter 1:3). To summon up this bright and blessed hope for our own lives can test the
capacity of even the faithful, like Abraham, who according to scripture &#8220;<i>against hope believed in
hope&#8221;</i>&#8211;that is he hoped even when things seemed hopeless (Romans 4:18). In dark nights of the
soul, such blessed hope can be oh so hard to hold on to. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Hope and Despair 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Nonetheless, we are instructed to<i> &#8220;lay hold on the hope set before us; Which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul&#8221;</i> (Hebrews 6:18-19). In order to grasp hold of this anchor, we need to
understand it. For me, this is best achieved by gazing into the dark realm hope&#8217;s antithesis:
despair.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The distinction between faith and hope comes most clearly into focus for me when I think about
their antonyms. The opposite of faith is doubt; the opposite of hope is despair. Mormon declares
quite precisely, <i>&#8220;if ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair, and despair cometh because of
iniquity&#8221;</i> (Moroni10:22). <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">This last phrase may seem like hard doctrine. I adduce it 
		<i>not</i> to add guilt to those already
suffering from a sense of hopelessness but because Mormon&#8217;s words can help us understand
despair and shun it. Despair is, as Mormon precisely notes, to have no hope: <i>de sperare</i>. This is
what despair means etymologically: to be without hope; or, even more precisely, to be against
hope in the sense of denying hope. Therefore, traditionally despair has been thought to be both
caused by sin and also to be sinful in itself. Why? Because despair is not only to be 
		<i>without</i> hope
but to set oneself <i>against</i> hope. To do this is ultimately to deny the power of Christ and his
Atonement, at least with respect to one&#8217;s own life. It is to say that Christ cannot, or will not,
redeem me, heal me, bless me. It is to believe that the future is closed against the possibility of
blessedness, at least for oneself; that things will never get better, that the dawn will never come.
Religious despair is thus even darker than discouragement, despondency, and even
depression&#8211;those miserable kindred which prepare the soul for despair (Note that Paul
differentiates between being distressed and in despair: 2 Corinthians 3:8). Truly 
		<i>&#8220;despair cometh
from iniquity&#8221;</i>&#8211;and not just sin in general but particularly from the sin of denying the power of
the Atonement in one&#8217;s own life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Again, this is hard doctrine but I&#8217;ve found it to be helpful for those tempted by the Evil One to
sink into despair. It is important to see this as a temptation which should be resisted. Despair is
Satan&#8217;s attempt to make us miserable like himself (2 Nephi 2:27). Realizing this can help us say,
&#8220;No! I will <i>not</i> go there. I will <i>not</i> despair. For there is hope. There is hope because of Christ.
However dark the night, the dawn will come.&#8221; Or, in the words of one of my favorite Victorian
poets, we can say: <i>&#8220;Not, I&#8217;ll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee; . . . I can; / Can
something, hope, wish day come, not choose not to be&#8221; </i>(Gerard Manley Hopkins, &#8220;Carrion
Comfort&#8221;). As believers, we ought to exclaim with Paul:<i> &#8220;We are troubled on every side, yet not
distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair&#8221;</i> (2 Corinthians 3:8).<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">For despair is the Devil&#8217;s dominion. It defines the internal essence of Hell. You may remember
that Dante portrays the Gates of Hell inscribed with the dreadful words, <i>&#8220;Abandon All Hope Ye
Who Enter Here&#8221;</i> (Dante, <i>Inferno</i>, Canto 3). He believed that the wretched souls who dwell
therein live without hope, in eternal despair of salvation. Dante thought that, worlds without end,
they could never be redeemed, never enter paradise. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Likewise, taking a cue from Dante, Milton describes the 
		<i>&#8220;dungeon horrible&#8221; </i>of Hell as a dark
realm where <i>&#8220;hope never comes&#8221;</i> (John Milton, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, 1.66). Milton, however, makes it
very clear that this is not a result so much of <i>where </i>Satan and his minions live but 
		<i>who</i> they are.
Although Milton&#8217;s Satan escapes Hell physically to come to earth to tempt mankind, the Milton
wryly observes that he can no more flee from Hell <i>&#8220;than from himself can fly&#8221;</i>: 
		<i>&#8220;for within him
Hell / He brings.&#8221; </i>And Satan himself confesses,<i> &#8220;myself am Hell&#8221;</i> (<i>Paradise Lost</i>, 4.20-23, 75).
Milton understands that those who suffer the pangs of the damned are punished not simply 
		<i>for
</i>their sins but <i>by</i> their sins&#8211;particularly by the sin of despair. Let us resolve never to enter this
awful diabolic domain but to seize the anchor of hope if ever we feel drowning in a sea of
hopelessness (Hebrews 6:19; Ether 12:4).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">You can Get There From Here</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, Satan is enticing too many today to let go of this anchor and drown in a sea
of hopelessness. Too many are succumbing to his diabolic lie that there is no hope for
them&#8211;including young people who have their whole adult lives in front of them, yet somehow
come to feel that the future is foreclosed, that things will never get better but only get worse. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A friend of mine tells the story of coming to BYU for a job interview a few years ago when there
was a huge hole in middle of campus for the underground addition to the library. This meant that
many sidewalks were closed off and there were fences and detour signs everywhere. My friend
had an appointment in the Administration building but he had parked by the student center. So
he asked a freshman how to get there. The puzzled freshman furrowed his brow, thought about
this for a moment, and then said: &#8220;You can&#8217;t get there from here.&#8221;
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Too many young people feel this way nowadays about their own lives. They feel they can&#8217;t get
through this assignment, class, or major; that they can never reach their goal to go on a mission,
get married, have a family, qualify for a career, and so forth. In short, they can&#8217;t get there from
here. So they are tempted to give up, feeling there is no hope; things will never get better; in fact,
they&#8217;ll only get worse. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But there is hope! There is always hope! You CAN get there from here. Sadly, however,
sometimes people take irreversible, permanent actions in response to reversible, temporary
crises. The Deseret News recently ran a week-long series of grim reports on the rash of suicides
among young people in our area (&#8220;Teen Suicide: Utah&#8217;s Grim Reality,&#8221; Deseret News. April 23-28, 2006). What a devastating tragedy, not only for the individuals involved but for their families
and friends as well!<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Two Literary Examples of Overcoming Despair 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sadly, it is often the best among us&#8211;those precious, hypersensitive souls so eager to be
good&#8211;who are most vulnerable to hopelessness. Modern psychologists have demonstrated a
strong correlation between perfectionism and hopelessness. In fact, however, this insight has
been long understood by religious thinkers. Let me share two examples from my study of
Renaissance religious literature. Edmund Spenser and John Bunyan each wrote Christian
allegories about good men who are afflicted by and then overcome despair. I share these
allegories because they have helped me, and I believe they can help you, understand both the
seductive psychology of this dread spiritual pathology, despair, and its antidote, gospel hope in
Jesus Christ. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, John Bunyan illustrates how pious people are particularly vulnerable to
bouts of discouragement, despondency, and even despair. His hero, named Christian, no sooner
starts on his pilgrimage to the Celestial City than he falls into a Slough of Despond.
Despondency is the first peril to be overcome for the wayfaring Christian who turns his back on
the world and sets forth on a journey to God. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">After being helped out of the Slough of Despond, Christian continues on his way, only later to be
taken prisoner by the Giant Despair, who casts him into a filthy dark dungeon, beats him
incessantly, and bids him take his life. Finally, after praying all through a dark night with a
fellow pilgrim named Hopeful, Christian discovers the means for escape. This occurs,
symbolically, on Sunday morning at dawn:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in
this passionate speech, &#8220;What a fool, quoth he, am I, thus to lie in a stinking
Dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty? I have a Key in my bosom called
Promise, that will, I am persuaded, open any Lock in Doubting-Castle. Then said
Hopeful, That&#8217;s good news; good Brother pluck it out of thy bosom, and try</i> (John
Bunyan, <i>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress </i>(Oxford Univ. Press, 1984), 96).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Bunyan&#8217;s didactic message is clear: Believers can expect to battle despondency and despair on
their journey heavenward. Nonetheless, each soul has the key to unlock the prison of despair in
the promise of eternal life. It lies within reach for it lies within our hearts. Note, however, that
Bunyan does not say we create the key by positive thinking. The key has been fashioned by God
for us through Christ. It is given us. Yet it also must be grasped. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Now a second example. Edmund Spenser&#8217;s character Redcrosse Knight, who represents holiness,
learns a similar lesson at the Cave of Despair. The figure of Despair looks at first like an easy
enemy for a bold knight of holiness to dispatch. Despair is, after all, a grisly, horrid-looking
wretch who dwells in a &#8220;darksome cave&#8221; surrounded by the corpses of those he has induced to
kill themselves. Who could possibly be attracted to such a vice? I often think of this when I see
people choosing to give way to doom and gloom. From the outside, it is easy to think: Who
would choose to go there? Who could possibly find wallowing in self-pity and self-loathing
attractive. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then Despair talks and <i>&#8220;the knight much wondered at his sudden wit&#8221;</i> (Edmund Spenser, 
		<i>The
Faerie Queene</i>, Book 1, Canto 9, Stanza 40). For Despair makes suicide sound good! His words
are calculated to appeal precisely to those who, like Redcrosse, embrace the quest for holiness
and perfection. Despair&#8217;s rhetoric is aimed at those who want so much to be good. So like Satan,
Despair makes Redcrosse remember his many mistakes and faults; the many times he has strayed
from his mission; how often he has disappointed and betrayed those who love him and stained
his soul with sin. He then concludes:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>&#8220;Then do no further go, nor further stray,</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>But here lie down, and to thy rest betake,</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>. . . . </i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For what hath life, that may it lov&eacute;d make,</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And gives not rather cause it to forsake?</i>&#8221; (<i>The Faerie Queene</i>, Book 1, Canto 9,
Stanza 43). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Spenser here exposes the subtle psychology of despair which Satan ever deploys to deceive, if he
can, even the very elect (Matthew 24:24). Spenser helps us see how a good man, a man who
fervently desires perfection, can be induced to contemplate suicide through the Adversary&#8217;s
distortion of his otherwise righteous desire to be pure and holy. Hypnotized by Despair&#8217;s words,
Redcrosse, like too many modern perfectionists, with trembling hand takes out a dagger and
prepares to kill himself. <br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Suddenly, however, Despair&#8217;s dark spell is broken when Redcrosse&#8217;s lady-fair, named Una,<i>
&#8220;snatched the curs&eacute;d knife&#8221; </i>and rebukes her knight. Una is a Christ figure, a figure of grace. She
reminds Redcrosse of his mission to slay the dragon:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080"><i>Fie, fie, faint hearted knight,</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080"><i>What meanest thou by this reproachful strife?</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080"><i>Is this the battle, which thou vaunt&#8217;st to fight</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080"><i>With that fire-mouthed Dragon, horrible and bright?</i> ( 
		<i>The Faerie Queene</i>, Book
1, Canto 9, Stanza 50).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Further, Una reminds Redcrosse that, though a sinner, he can still hope for God&#8217;s tender mercies,
because <i>&#8220;Where justice grows, there grows </i>[also] <i>greater grace&#8221;</i> (<i>The Faerie Queene</i>, Book 1,
Canto 10, Stanza 1). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This literary example has often come to my mind when counseling those who are sinking into
hopelessness. It is important to help those so afflicted to feel the Spirit. The Holy Ghost, like
Una, can break through the darkness and become an agent of grace. It is also often useful to
remind them of their divinely appointed mission&#8211;as set forth in the Scriptures, gospel covenants,
and personal patriarchal blessings. These contain promises that can rekindle hope. And, most of
all, it is critical to testify to perfectionists of God&#8217;s perfect love for them. Yes, He is perfectly
just. But He is also perfectly merciful. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Moreover, He is our Father, who loves us more abundantly than we can imagine. As a father I
know how I feel about my children when they stumble and stray. I want to lift them back up. I
want to bring them home. Yet my fatherly love is but a pale shadow of Our Father in Heaven&#8217;s
love for his errant children. We worship a God whose whole purpose is to bring to pass the
immortality and eternal life of his children (Moses 1:39). He, too, wants to lift us up and bring us
home. Yes, the Heavens sometimes thunder but they also weep over wayward humanity. This
divine love gives us cause to hope. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus sought to help us imagine and feel Our Father&#8217;s loving kindness in the Parable of the
Prodigal Son. The climax of the story occurs when the returning prodigal <i>&#8220;was yet a great way
off,&#8221; </i>and his father <i>&#8220;had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him&#8221;</i> (Luke
15:20). I can scarcely read this without emotion. BYU&#8217;s Museum of Art has recently acquired
the picture of this moment that you see on the screen. Note that the Father has come down from
his home above, descending an entire flight of stairs to embrace his returning son, who has
barely placed his foot on the first stair on his ascent upward to his father&#8217;s house. Note, too, the
Father&#8217;s tender embrace. O, how great is <i>&#8220;the condescension of God,&#8221; 
		</i>who reaches out to all his
children with open arms! (1 Nephi 11:16). It <i>&#8220;grieveth&#8221;</i> our God that he should lose what he
loves (See the Parable of the Olive Tree, in Jacob 5). And He loves his children so deeply that
He gave his Beloved Son so that we could become whole and holy. His arms are outstretched in
mercy to us. To despair is to turn our backs on this divine embrace. To hope is to allow ourselves
to be loved and forgiven.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bunyan and Spenser help us understand that despair often afflicts believers; they also help us see
that there is a way out of the dark, stinking dungeons and caves where despair dwells. The face
of Christ can light the darkest prison, bringing a <i>&#8220;brightness of hope&#8221; 
		</i>amid our deepest distress.
As Paul writes, <i>&#8220;For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
hearts . . . in the face of Jesus Christ.&#8221; </i>Therefore the faithful proclaim, Paul continues,<i> &#8220;We are
troubled on every side; yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair&#8221;</i> (2 Corinthians
4:6, 8).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Hope and the Atonement</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I trust it is abundantly clear by now that the antidote for despair lies in the hope we have through
the Atonement. The gospel, or good news, gives us hope. Gospel hope is centered in the
Atonement of Jesus Christ. <i>&#8220;What shall we hope for?&#8221; </i>asks Mormon, 
		<i>&#8220;Behold I say unto you
that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be
raised unto life eternal . . . according to the promise&#8221;</i> (Moroni 7:41). This hope is sure because
this promise is sure. It has been written in the blood of Christ. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In ordinary usage, <i>hope</i> often conveys <i>&#8220;a hint of uncertainty. For example we say we hope for a
change of the weather. . . . In the language of the gospel, however, the word 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">hope</span> is sure,
unwavering, active&#8221; </i>(<i>True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference </i>(The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, 2004), 85). Gospel hope is anchored on the ultimate reality of the Atonement
rather than on our often illusive proximate desires. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Elder Maxwell draws an important distinction between our ultimate hope in Christ and our
proximate hopes for the future (Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;Hope Through the Atonement of Jesus
Christ,&#8221; Ensign, Nov. 1998. 61). I sometimes think of this as a distinction between Hope (with a
capital &#8220;H&#8221;) and hopes (with a small &#8220;h&#8221;). Our proximate hopes and wishes can be the invention
of human desires, the off-spring of nothing deeper or sturdier than mere optimism. While
optimism is a good thing, in my view, gospel Hope is even more profound and more resilient
than optimism for it is anchored upon the bedrock reality of the Atonement. <br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Czech playwright and nation&#8217;s president Vaclav Havel observed:
		<i>&#8220;Hope is definitely not the
same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the
certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out&#8221;</i> (V&aacute;clav Havel,
		<i>Disturbing
the Peace</i>, ch. 5, 1986, trans. 1990). I would alter this slightly. Hope is 
		not only the certainty that things make sense, it is also the assurance 
		that, for those who love the Lord, things ultimately will turn out well 
		through the Atonement of Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are not promised that nothing will go wrong in this life. In fact, we know that sometimes
things do <i>not</i> seem to turn out well, forcing us to confess, with Nephi, that we<i> &#8220;do not know the
meaning of all things&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 11:17). Nevertheless, we can still be certain, regardless of how
things turn out in the near term, that &#8220;all things&#8221; make sense to God, and that in the long
term,<i>&#8220;all things&#8221;</i> shall ultimately work together for good for those that love the Lord, according
to the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;immutable&#8221; promise. We are assured, in deeply consoling language, several times
in scripture, that the Lord: </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>Giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and
all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my
name&#8217;s glory, saith the Lord </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 98:3. See also Romans 8:28;
Doctrine and Covenants 90:24; 110:15; 105:40).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">When severe trials come, like the death of a loved one, this 
		<i>&#8220;immutable covenant&#8221; </i>fills us with
powerful ultimate hope. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I think, for example of my dear nephew Clark who is just your age. Last year he fell in love with
a beautiful girl named Megan. Clark was shy at first. He needed a little encouragement. After
their first date Megan told him: &#8220;This was fun. You should ask me out again.&#8221; Well he did, and
they got married in the Bountiful Temple last December. They were so in love, so full of hope.
But three weeks later Megan was killed in a car accident while they were driving to a reception
in Arizona and Clark was badly injured. <br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Over the past five months as he has been recovering from his injuries, physical and spiritual,
Clark has had to cling to ultimate hope. His former proximate hopes for the reception, his return
to school with Megan, a life together with her, etc. have all been dashed. Yet he still has ultimate
Hope, through the atonement of Christ, in a glorious resurrection and reunion. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This past Fast Sunday Clark returned to BYU where, I was told, he blessed the sacrament and
bore testimony of the hope he feels through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. His new single
student ward did not know about Megan. Only his cousins in the audience knew the tragic
experience that made Clark&#8217;s sweet, simple expression of hope so poignant. They knew that
Clark had hope through the Atonement that he would be with Megan again and eventually
understand the Lord&#8217;s purposes in his afflictions. They also knew, however, that this reunion and
this understanding would likely not come in this life. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Patience and Hope</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This brings me to patience. Since gospel hope is ultimate, we must await its perfect fulfillment
until some future day. This same holds true for those many righteous proximate hopes, for which
we so frequently and fervently pray. Hope is future-oriented. This means that patience is
required for the present. No wonder, then, that the scriptures frequently link patience with hope.
&#8220;Patience&#8221; describes <i>how</i> we are to endure the intervals while we wait upon Providence to fulfill
our hopes, both ultimate and proximate.<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">This can be really trying because most of us are by nature impatient. We are like my
grandchildren who often say &#8220;I want it <i>now</i>, grandpa.&#8221; Or like an unmarried young woman I
know with a delightful Anne-of-Green-Gables flair for the dramatic. She is wont to say: &#8220;My life
is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.&#8221; I understand her real if somewhat rhetorically theatrical
desperation. It is so hard to be patient when opportunities like marriage, or jobs, or having
children are delayed. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I think of &#8220;patience&#8221; I remember that the word derives from the Latin &#8220;to suffer.&#8221; (Think
about this next time you agree to be a hospital patient!) To be patient in the gospel sense is to be
long-suffering, like Job. Patience is the ability to suffer suffering well. It teaches us to endure
affliction with grace and good cheer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This includes enduring what I call the hidden trial within our trials&#8211;that is, the trial of not
knowing if and when the trial will end (See my BYU devotional talk &#8220;One Step Enough&#8221; (BYU
Speeches) 30 June 1992). If you are like me, the suffering incident to not knowing if and when
suffering will end can be even more trying than the immediate occasion of the suffering. If we
only knew if and when we would pass the class, find a job, get married, have a wayward child or
spouse return, recover from cancer, and so forth&#8211;why then we could pluck up the courage to bear
our present portion of pain. It is the <i>uncertainty</i> as much or more than the 
		<i>actuality</i> of suffering
that most vexes us and tries our patience. Tellingly, the most frequent cry of the faithful in
scripture during adversity is not &#8220;Why?&#8221;, nor even &#8220;Let this pass!&#8221;, but 
		<i>&#8220;How long, O Lord, how
long!&#8221;</i> (The Psalms alone contain this plea eight times. It also occurs in Isaiah, Habukkuk,
Zechariah, Revelation, 2 Nephi, Alma three times, and the Doctrine and Covenants twice).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">To endure the hidden timing trial within our trials demands both patience and hope. No wonder
that the scriptures so frequently link patience and hope (E.g., Romans 5:4; 8:25; 15:4; 1 Thes.
1:3; Alma 32:41; Doctrine and Covenants 6:19). Or that within a few verses, the Lord is called
both the <i>&#8220;God of Patience&#8221; </i>and the <i>&#8220;God of Hope&#8221;</i> (Romans 15:5,13). Let me briefly explore a
little more fully the relationship between hope and patience.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Hopeful Patience, Patient Hope</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I said at the outset of this talk, tribulation both 
		<i>calls forth </i>and <i>calls for </i>patience and hope.
Both patience and hope define not only sanctifying <i>outcomes</i> of tribulation but also the 
		<i>means </i>by
which disciples are enabled to cope with tribulation. Patience and faith are not only born of
adversity; they also help us bear adversity. Hence, we are to be patient and hopeful 
		<i>in</i> our
afflictions, not only <i>after</i> them. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In this sanctifying process, each virtue can and should modify the other. What kind of hope
should we have in affliction? Why, patient hope. Not off-and-on again hope, not wavering hope.
But <i>&#8220;enduring&#8221; </i>or <i>&#8220;steadfast&#8221; </i>hope, which are synonyms for the word often translated as<i>
&#8220;patience&#8221;</i> in the King James Version. Patient hope then is steadfast hope&#8211;<i>&#8220;steadfast in Christ&#8221;</i>
(2 Nephi 31:20). <br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Likewise, what kind of patience or endurance does the Lord expect from us? Why, hopeful
patience. Not mere grim and grudging resignation; not gritting our teeth while cursing under our
breath. But expectant, hopeful perseverance. Hopeful patience or endurance expects the dawn,
trusting in the Lord&#8217;s repeated <i>&#8220;immutable&#8221; </i>promise that all things shall ultimately work
together for good for those that love the Lord (Doctrine and Covenants 98:3).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The gospel thus encourages us to be both enduring (patient) and expectant (hopeful) in our
trials&#8211;exercising hopeful patience and the patient hope (1 Thess 1:3. Cf. &#8220;Come Let Us Anew&#8221;
LDS Hymns, no. 217). We should strive to be like the people of Alma, who submitted
		<i>&#8220;cheerfully with patience to all the will of the Lord&#8221;</i> ( Mosiah 24:15). And like the much-afflicted Zoramite poor, whom Amulek counseled to
		<i>&#8220;have patience, and bear </i>[their] <i>afflictions,
with a firm hope&#8221;</i> (Alma 34:41). There you have it: cheerful patience, firm hope. This is the
gospel prescription for how we should bear tribulation. Hope lends patience a smile. Patience
gives hope a spine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Faith, Hope, and Charity </span></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">As you can see, there is an intimate interrelation between patience and hope. The same applies to
the relationship of hope to faith and charity. Sister Elaine Jack calls these three 
		<i>&#8220;good friends,&#8221;
</i>which become stronger because of their close association with each other (Elaine L. Jack, &#8220;A
Perfect Brightness of Hope,&#8221; Ensign, Mar. 1992, 10). According to Elder Russell M. Nelson they
support one another like legs on a three-legged stool (Russell M. Nelson, &#8220;A More Excellent
Hope,&#8221; Ensign, Feb. 1997, 60). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We often think of faith, hope, and charity as standing in linear relation to each other: as if first
one obtained faith, then hope, then charity. But this does not correspond to what Mormon
teaches nor to what we know from our own experience. In scripture as in life, the relationship
among faith, hope, and charity is circular and interactive. Thus, while charity may be the
crowning virtue of the three, it is not necessarily successive to hope or faith. Indeed, charity may
be foundational to hope and faith, just as hope and faith may provide a catalyst for the pure love
of Christ. Mormon presents all three virtues as dynamically interdependent. Understanding their
dynamic, circular interaction can help us both appreciate and cultivate hope. So let me probe
these interrelationships just a bit with you.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Mormon explains that hope not only follows from faith, it enables it: 
		<i>&#8220;how is it that ye can attain
unto faith, except ye have hope?&#8221;</i>, says Mormon (Moroni 7:40). This reverses the normal
sequence of faith and hope. Similarly, Mormon, describes faith and hope as evidence one has
charity rather than the cause of charity. A person full of charity <i>&#8220;believeth all things, hopeth all
things&#8221;</i> (Moroni 7:45). Likewise, Mormon states that where there is faith and hope,
		<i>&#8220;there must
also be charity&#8221;</i>&#8211;as if the first two virtues cannot be present without the last (Moroni 10:20).
		<br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Clearly for Mormon, these three virtues are indeed good friends. Each virtue seems to be both a
cause and result of the others, and none stands entirely separate from the other. Now all this is
not just abstract doctrine. It is useful information to know when we decide to work on hope.
Mormon implies that we can do so only in concert with working on faith and charity. Only by
striving to believe and love more fully will be able to hope more fully. <br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The interdependence among these three virtues is easiest to see with faith and hope, which I
described at the outset as near twins. Elder McConkie observes, faith and hope are
		<i>&#8220;inseparable&#8221;</i> (Bruce R. McConkie, <i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, 2nd ed. [1966], 365&#8211;66). And Elder
Maxwell notes that <i>&#8220;Faith and hope are constantly interactive, and may not always be precisely
distinguished or sequenced&#8221;</i> (Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;Brightness of Hope,&#8221; Ensign, Nov. 1994, 34;
and &#8220;Hope through the Atonement of Jesus Christ,&#8221; Ensign, Nov. 1998, 61 ). Though I have
suggested some ways to distinguish between faith and hope, the two virtues are clearly closely
related. Paul even defines faith as nearly synonymous with hope: faith is the assurance of things
hoped for (Hebrews 11:1, JST). If we would enlarge hope, we must increase our faith, and vice
versa.<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Less obvious is the interactive relationship between hope and charity. Nonetheless, it is a fact
that hope helps open the heart to the pure love of Christ, and likewise that the pure love of Christ
kindles hope. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me explain. Think how hope readies your heart to feel love&#8211;for yourself and for others.
When we are full of hope, which remember is future-oriented, we are prepared to forget
ourselves and reach out to others, as the pure love of Christ requires. By contrast, when we feel
hopeless, we tend to be self-critical and self-preoccupied and therefore incapable of giving love.
It is hard for the hopeless to get outside themselves and approach others with pure love, or to
accept possibility in themselves and others for change, as Christ does. Without hope, we feel
unloveable and unloving. Hope makes us receptive to the pure love of Christ.
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">By the same token, charity, or the pure love of Christ, readies the heart for hope. Charity causes
us to look with hope upon ourselves and others. Perfect love leads us to be expectant about the
future, to have hope for change. As the scriptures affirm, <i>&#8220;Perfect love casteth out all fear&#8221;</i>
(Moroni 8:16; cf. 1 John 4:18. Note that Mormon is even more categorical than John: love casts
out <i>all</i> fear). By casting out fear, perfect love makes room in the heart for hope. Truly, as the
scriptures testify, the soul possessed of charity <i>&#8220;hopeth all things.&#8221;</i>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I know about the intimate 
		relation between hope and charity from personal experience. When I feel 
		hope, I am better able to love. Similarly, when I feel the pure love of 
		Christ, I am better able to hope. The world brightens. Blessed hope is 
		kindled in my heart. And I am reminded of the old truth that the night 
		is darkest just before dawn.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold">A Perfect Brightness of Hope 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I imagine hope, I think not only of the scriptural image of an anchor to secure and steady
us when we are beaten by the waves on <i>&#8220;life&#8217;s tempestuous sea&#8221;</i> (&#8220;Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me&#8221; LDS
Hymns, no. 104). I also think of light, especially the light of dawn that dispels dark night. In
particular, I imagine a dawn long ago which lighted an empty tomb. <i>&#8220;Hope caused disciples to
go quickly and expectantly to an empty garden tomb&#8221;</i> (See Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:8-12). 
		<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Several years ago, a dear friend (and former president of this school) gave me a print of a
painting by a Swiss artist named Eugene Burnand that captures for me this image of hope. It
depicts Peter and John running to the tomb on Easter morning. In it, we see the faces of two men,
one old and one young, each pressing forward toward the dawn. We do not see the empty tomb,
nor the angel. Only their expectant faces. And the dawn.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I love the symbolism of this moment. Youth and age, innocence and experience, each leaning
into the early morning light. Both faces full of eagerness, longing, love, and expectation. Yet
Peter&#8217;s face also lined with care, some furrows perhaps deepened by anxiety over what the
Master, whom he had recently thrice denied, will say to his great-hearted, if imperfect, apostle.
Yet still he rushes toward that rendezvous with his beloved Redeemer. I love this image of hope.
It portrays your youth and my age, as we all with our varied experiences<i> &#8220;press forward&#8221; 
		</i>toward
Christ, with a <i>&#8220;brightness of hope&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 31:20).<br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I especially love the fact that Burnand chooses to depict this pivotal moment in salvation
history&#8211;Resurrection morning&#8211;from a very human point of view. He tells the story through the
experience of Peter and John. Moreover, he captures them in a moment in time comparable to
our own&#8211;before they have seen the risen Christ, in an posture of intense hope for reunion with
him. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We, too, live before a longed-for embrace from our risen Lord. We live on this side of the
Second Coming but in eager expectation of a great morning of resurrection and reunion.
Nonetheless, we can <i>&#8220;press forward&#8221; </i>towards that remarkable rendezvous with a 
		<i>&#8220;perfect
brightness of hope&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 31:20). We can hope for a glorious embrace when we shall see the
wounds in his hands, feet, and side, and be taken again into his arms&#8211;and 
		<i>&#8220;all shall be well, and
every manner of thing shall be well&#8221;</i> (This phrase comes from Julian of Norwich, in 
		<i>A Book of
Showings</i>, ch. 27. It was made famous by T. S. Eliot in <i>Four Quartets</i>, &#8220;Little Gidding.&#8221; For both
authors, these words express profound hope, in the face of evil, that God shall make all things
right. I am struck by the similarity to the refrain sung by the Mormon pioneers, who also
expressed their faith and hope that &#8220;all is well&#8221;).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, this is my hope. It is the perennial hope of saints in every age called to

endure trials. Let us eschew despair and embrace hope no less than we do faith and charity,

Hymns, no. 104). And no matter how dark the night, let us always orient our lives toward the
dawn. For the day shall dawn when the Lord will receive us again in his arms and wipe away all

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My dear fellow students, faculty, and administration, I am honored and delighted that the First
Presidency has extended to me this opportunity to meet with you at Brigham Young
University&#8211;Idaho. I bring you the love, greetings, and best wishes of the Church Board of
Education and Board of Trustees. This board consists of the First Presidency, several members
of the Twelve, others, and myself. We meet once a month, and between these monthly meetings,
the Executive Committee, of which I serve as a member, meets. The members of this board have
had many decades of experience in educational and business matters. They are wise men and
women. They are directed by the Spirit and are presided over by President Gordon B. Hinckley,
our prophet, seer, and revelator. In all of our decisions and deliberations, we have one key
concern&#8212;that is you, the student.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">You are blessed to have President Kim B. Clark as president of Brigham Young
University&#8211;Idaho. He has the trust of the Church Board of Education and Board of Trustees. He
is an inspired Church leader, and you would be well advised to follow his counsel and direction
while you are privileged to attend this university.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I feel I have been directed by the Spirit to prepare a message for you today. I trust and pray that
with your faith and prayers and my own preparation, I might speak those things that the Lord
would have me speak and deliver to you today a message that will build your faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ.</span><br /></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This scripture from Alma teaches that, more than anything else, the word of God, or the
scriptures, will have the more powerful effect upon our lives. I would like to share some specific
scriptures with you today.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Last year we were counseled by the First Presidency to read the Book of Mormon. There
probably was never a time in the history of the Church when so many members were reading the
Book of Mormon at the same time. As I have thought of that experience in my life, I have
pondered over the power of testimony and conviction that has come to members of the Church as
the result of reading the Book of Mormon.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The promised blessings for reading the Book of Mormon have and are being realized by many
Saints, including promises that there will be an added measure of the Spirit of God, there will be
a greater resolve to obey commandments, and there will be a stronger testimony of the reality of
the Son of God.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In a recent meeting of the Church Board of Education, President Hinckley was presented with a
copy of this book. This beautifully bound volume of more than 300 pages consists of thousands
of testimonies of the Book of Mormon from students from Brigham Young University. Each
testimony is a personal witness of the power that comes from reading the Book of Mormon.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">For several years I had the opportunity to sit in meetings with Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Elder Maxwell had the unique gift and ability to recognize
what I have termed as <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one-liners</i></span>. He could read scripture and pick out several words, and that
became a sermon or a book. For example, he wrote one book entitled <i>All These Things Shall
Give Thee Experience</i>, consisting of the brief word of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith
while the Prophet languished in Liberty Jail (See Doctrine and Covenants 122:7). On another
occasion, Elder Maxwell wrote a book entitled <i>Things as They Really Are, </i>taken from the fourth
chapter of Jacob. On another occasion he gave a talk and published a book entitled 
		<i>Not My Will,
But Thine, </i>which are the words of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, as found in Luke, chapter
22.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I read the Book of Mormon last year, I recognized several

prayer and scripture study, to find solutions and answers themselves&#8221;</i> (<i>Church Handbook of

<p>

<p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I would encourage all of us to exercise a little more faith and do as Nephi did, be willing to be
		<i>&#8220;led by the Spirit, <span style="text-decoration: underline">not knowing beforehand the things which I should do</span>.&#8221;

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Second</span>: Another special truth I learned is also contained in 1 Nephi. You remember the story of
Zoram, who was the servant of Laban. After Nephi secured the plates of brass, which resulted in
the death of Laban, Nephi, clothed in Laban&#8217;s robe, left the palace with the plates and met
Zoram, the servant of Laban. Initially, Zoram thought that Nephi was Laban but then realized
that he was not, and suddenly, Zoram feared for his life. The scriptures record that Nephi seized
Zoram and held him that he should not flee. Nephi then spoke with him by the swearing of an
oath and said that he need not fear and that he, Zoram, would be a free man if he would
accompany Nephi and his family into the wilderness (See 1 Nephi 4:33).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The scriptures further record that Zoram took courage at the words of Nephi and also made an
oath that he would tarry with Nephi and his family from that time forth. And now, the
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one-liner</i></span>
that accompanies this story I read from the fourth chapter of 1 Nephi: <i>&#8220;And it came to pass that
when Zoram had made an oath unto us, <span style="text-decoration: underline">our fears did cease concerning him</span>&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 4:37,

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What a marvelous

cease concerning that individual. Let me explain.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8216;In covenant making, ritual oaths attest the fidelity of those entering into the
covenant.&#8217; </i>In the <i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i> we read that <i>&#8216;oath-swearing was

references to Nephi and Zoram swearing an oath to affirm their promise</i>&#8217;(See

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Today, oaths play a role in our religion and ritual. Let me share several examples.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we say &#8220;amen&#8221; at the end of a prayer, we are reaffirming that we concur with the prayer.
The word <i>amen</i> actually means in Hebrew &#8220;let it be affirmed&#8221; or &#8220;verily.&#8221;</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">All priesthood brethren know that the receipt of the Melchizedek Priesthood comes with an oath
and a covenant. Of course, we enter into sacred and holy covenants in temples that follow
ancient patterns. Each time you raise your right hand to sustain persons in their callings, you
offer a silent oath.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The honor code you signed when you entered BYU&#8211;Idaho could be construed as an agreement, a
promise or oath that you have committed to certain standards while you continue as a student at
this university. I pose this question, Why not allow these standards&#8212;this honor code&#8212;to
become the basis of your lifelong moral standards? </span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Returning now to the 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one-liner</i></span><i>,</i> I wonder, can all our fears cease concerning a member who has
entered into covenants and eternal commitments? Can our church leaders rely upon us? For
those of us who are baptized, faithful members of the Church, and in particular those who hold
the priesthood, should there be any fear that we will keep the commandments? Should there be
any fear that we will pay an honest and full tithing and other obligations? Should there be any
fear that we will faithfully fulfill our Church assignments, including home and visiting teaching?
Should our leaders need to continually remind us of the evils of pornography, or can our leaders
simply know that based on the covenants and commitments that we have taken that they need not
fear concerning us, that we will be faithful?</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We often say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get on the bishop&#8217;s worry list.&#8221; I learned from reading the Book of
Mormon last year and from this wonderful <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one-liner</i></span> that if we have entered into sacred
covenants and pledged our obedience to our Savior Jesus Christ, we should all be in a position
where not only our leaders but also our family and certainly our Savior Jesus Christ, should not
fear concerning us. We will be faithful!</span><br /></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In a recent training for General Authorities at the April 2006 general conference, President
James E. Faust gave the following

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8226;Regular temple attendance</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As you see, there is absolutely nothing new in that counsel. It has been repeated to us for decades
by our Church leaders. We have to be very careful that we do not reject and fail to follow such
simple, basic counsel from our leaders. Otherwise, we may become<i> &#8220;past feeling&#8221; 
		</i>as to the
Spirit. We must always be teachable. We must always be willing to do the simple things. The
gospel is not to be complicated or mysterious. It is simple, basic, and built on the simple faith of
a child.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Occasionally, we see members who seek to complicate the simple basic truths of the gospel.
They seem to seek for a hidden meaning in a gospel principle or for something that has not yet
been revealed to the prophets. When we do so and when we neglect our daily prayers and rely
upon our own judgment and strength, we may feel that we do not need or require the help of
others, especially of our Heavenly Father.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Instead we need to listen to the simple words of the sacrament prayer and try to visualize in our
mind as we prepare to take the sacrament what it means to <i>&#8220;eat in remembrance of the body of
thy Son&#8221; </i>and to be <i>&#8220;willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him&#8221;</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 20:77). The simple act of partaking of the sacrament, worshipping in
the temple, bearing testimony in a fast and testimony meeting, and participating in a family
home evening ought to arouse feelings in our heart for the Savior. We should never be so
calloused and removed from such spiritual experiences that we find ourselves <i>&#8220;past feeling.&#8221;</i></span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fourth</span>: As I read the Book of Mormon last year, I read in the fourth chapter of Jacob another
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one-liner</i></span> I would like to share with you. In this chapter, Jacob explains why some people reject
the gospel. He refers to these people as being a stiffnecked people and then says that they<i>
&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">despised the words of plainness</span>&#8221;</i> and that they were 
		<i>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">looking beyond the mark</span>&#8221;</i> (Jacob 4:14,

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The two

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If one gets to the point where he or she 
		<i>&#8220;</i>[despises] <i>words of plainness,&#8221; </i>inactivity or apostasy
may not be far behind. Those who seek to weaken the faith of members often use the guise of
challenging the simple truths of the gospel and replacing them by secular and sophisticated
concepts.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To 
		<i>&#8220;</i>[look] <i>beyond the mark&#8221; </i>is to look for things that are truer than true. The scriptures speak
for themselves and are true. Alma warns of this problem: <i>&#8220;Behold, the scriptures are before you;
if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction&#8221;</i> (Alma 13:20).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To

you do not look beyond the simple truths of the scriptures and delve into self-interpretation.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There is a similar

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Mormon warns against 
		<i>&#8220;making a mock of that which </i>[is] <i>sacred&#8221;</i> (Helaman 4:12). This has
application when we consider the privilege we have to enter sacred temples. Be careful that you
never mock sacred ordinances or the requirements we live to be worthy to participate in such
holy matters. Without further explanation, I feel you know of that which I am speaking.</span></font></p>

your commitment to the Word of Wisdom, at the ridicule of others. It might have been
something in relation to honoring the Sabbath day or in your modest dress standards. Perhaps it

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember years ago traveling with a group of lawyers in Europe, and one evening at a very
fancy restaurant in France we enjoyed a wonderful meal. Of course, wine was served. I, being

knew of my standards and accepted that decision, but others questioned why I did not order
wine. I explained my standards, which they accepted. An interesting sidelight is that during all of
this conversation, the waiter, honoring my request for clear, bottled water, brought the glass of
water to me and then put in a drop of red food coloring, and the water immediately turned red.
We all laughed, but I maintained my standards.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Fortunately, in our generation, we live in a period of time that is closer to the time when the
Savior will return to earth. I believe, because of that fact, we have much more revealed
knowledge to guide and direct us, to help us make decisions. We have to be willing to accept the
fact that <i>&#8220;these are </i>[our] <i>days.&#8221; </i>We should make the best use of them and magnify all that we
are and have and not be overly concerned about what it might have been if we had lived at a
different time.</span><br /></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There are so many other 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one-liner</i></span>s that are available in the Book of Mormon. I have touched
only on several. (1) We should be willing to be led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the
things which we should do, (2) our leaders&#8217; fears should cease concerning us once we have
entered into sacred commitments, (3) we should never be so calloused as to be past feeling so
that we cannot feel sacred words, (4) we are warned to not despise words of plainness and to be
careful not to look beyond the mark for things that have not yet been revealed or to mock that
which is sacred, (5) we should not be deterred by those who point fingers of scorn at us or our
standards. Remember, Lehi said, <i>&#8220;We heeded them not.&#8221; </i>And lastly, (6) look to your future, not
the past. Be assured that these are your days.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Yesterday, we celebrated Memorial Day, a day set aside since the Civil War to remember
those who have died in our nation&#8217;s service. It is a time to reflect on wars past and

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In August of 2004, I was in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, completing a short tour of duty
for the Army before returning to Rexburg to begin fall semester. One evening, I received
an email message notifying me of an impending call to active military service in support
of Operation Iraqi Freedom III. Having left active duty in 2000 to teach at BYU</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">â</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Idaho, I
had considered as remote the possibility of being called up again. 9-11 and the
subsequent U.S.-led occupation of the country of Iraq changed all that. As an officer
trained in logistics, I knew it was only a matter of time before I found myself in the same
sand I had driven through in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm. Yet, it still came as a
shock. I distinctly remember calling my wife, Lorena, on the cell phone that evening
because I had to drive up onto a hill overlooking the installation so I could get reasonable
reception. We both cried, but afterward the sorrow of separation was quickly softened by
a distinct sense of pride at the thought of being selected to serve my country in time of
war.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Though the pride remains to this day, a year and a half away from family and friends
offered abundant opportunity for pondering and reflection. My feelings about serving
were increasingly complicated by what I saw as the moral debate over the nation&#8217;s
occupation of Iraq and led to questions regarding our responsibility as citizens in light of
the gospel. I found myself asking: &#8220;How should I, as a member of the Church, respond to
armed conflict?&#8221; &#8220;Is this war justified? If it isn&#8217;t, am I still doing the right thing by
willingly going into battle?&#8221; &#8220;Knowing that God is not the author of war, how, if at all,
can war be used to build up his kingdom here on earth?&#8221;</span></font></p>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is the answers to my very personal questions and concerns that I would like address
today with the distinct belief that, particularly since 9-11 rocked our quiet corner of the
earth, you have perhaps asked yourself similar questions. Along the way, I will share
with you doctrinal insights from scripture, apostles, and prophets, as well as anecdotes
and experiences from Saints in wartime. </span><br /></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let me set the stage by reading from the Old Testament. In 1 Samuel 24, we find David
hiding from King Saul in a cave. As you may recall, Saul&#8217;s hatred and jealousy toward
the war hero, David, had become so great that he was actively trying to kill him.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder Robert S. Wood of the Seventy, in his contribution on War to the Encylopedia of
Mormonism, states, <i>&#8220;The LDS response to the political realities of war is largely
conditioned by the concept of the justification of defensive war provided in the Book of
Mormon and in modern revelation.&#8221;</i> In the story of David, we see the spirit of restraint
and proportionality that typify the concept of just warfare and provide a guide for our
response to war. The Mormon view of just war was best illustrated by Captain Moroni. In<i><span style="text-decoration: underline">
</span></i><span style="text-decoration: underline">True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference</span>, we read:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>If Latter-day Saints are called upon to go into battle, they can look to the
example of Captain Moroni, the great military leader in the Book of
Mormon. Although he was a mighty warrior, he &#8220;did not delight in
bloodshed&#8221; (Alma 48:11). He was &#8220;firm in the faith of Christ,&#8221; and his
only reason for fighting was to &#8220;defend his people, his rights, and his
country, and his religion&#8221; (Alma 48:13). If Latter-day Saints must go to
war, they should go in a spirit of truth and righteousness, with a desire to
do good. They should go with love in their hearts for all God&#8217;s children,
including those on the opposing side. Then, if they are required to shed
another&#8217;s blood, their action will not be counted as a sin.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The resolve to avoid war if at all possible was reiterated in modern times in Section 98 of
the Doctrine and Covenants.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The preface to this section is insightful: Revelation given through Joseph Smith the
Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 6, 1833. This revelation came in consequence of the
persecution upon the saints in Missouri. It is natural that the saints in Missouri, having
suffered physically and also having lost property, should feel an inclination toward
retaliation and revenge. Therefore the Lord gave this revelation.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Key points of doctrine emerge in this revelation that are echoed by wartime prophets
since Joseph Smith. They include:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">4) Afflictions suffered by the Saints will be for their good.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This revelation, received in 1833 at the onset of anti-Mormon activities, undoubtedly led
to many a heated argument among members of the Church over how to respond as
persecutions increased. It was after the trials of the Saints in Missouri that the Nauvoo
Legion was formed for defensive purposes. Although the Legion&#8217;s manpower numbered
more than a quarter of the entire United States Army, arguably contributing to fears about
Mormon political and territorial ambitions, yet the prophet urged the fledgling church to
		<i>&#8220;keep the peace by being cool, considerate, virtuous, unoffending, manly and patriotic,
as the true sons of liberty ever have been.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is in a European conflict, the Crimean War, that Latter-day Saints, in this case, British,
first saw action. On 28 March 1854, Britain and France joined with the Ottoman Empire
in declaring war on Russia. It was, according to Wilford LeCheminant, a war infamous
for the waste of human life on the battlefields and even more wasteful behind the lines,
where thousands died of disease and where Florence Nightingale first gained acclaim as a
professional nurse. Fearing that its young missionaries might be drafted into the war, the
Church began sending only American citizens to the British Mission. Even so, dozens of
British Saints found themselves in the hellish nightmare of war created by a combination
of deadly new technologies, foul weather, incompetent leadership and objectives, and the
quick realization that what they were fighting for was simply not worth the cost. Yet, an
article in the Millenial Star of 1854 stated that, should any members be required
		<i>&#8220;to take
an active part </i>[in the war], <i>. . . we hope that such will do their duty, and prove faithful to
their country, for by so doing, they will be forwarding the best interests of the Kingdom
of God.&#8221; </i>Many of the young LDS soldiers made valiant efforts to live up the standards
they had been taught and to preach the gospel to their comrades in arms, despite the
horrific conditions they suffered for months on end. Quoting LeChiminant:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>As they fought in the battles and endured the hardships of the trenches
and the picket lines, the Saints were sustained by their religious beliefs, by
their brotherhood, and by the hope of emigrating to Utah after the war. In
a similar spirit, they demonstrated a determined missionary zeal to share
their faith whenever military duties permitted. Indeed, they were, as Elder
Richards described, &#8220;a valiant little band making converts amid the din of
war.&#8221;</i></span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The Spanish-American War saw two artillery units mobilized from Utah,
with the first LDS chaplain and the first LDS servicemen&#8217;s worship group
organized. This was a time of increased patriotism among the Saints
following the resolution of issues surrounding polygamy and statehood for
Utah. Free from such irritating disputes, the LDS community for the first
time could express its patriotism freely. The Spanish-American War was
an excellent outlet for their newfound enthusiasm for their country. Listen
to this closing statement made during the Sunday afternoon session of the
October 98 conference by President Frankin D. Richards, President of the
Quorum of the Twelve:</i></span></font></p>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Brethren, this great work is upon us . . . These wars have to occur to
loosen up the bonds of the governments that are so tight and strong
against religious liberty. I set it down as a fixed principle that these wars
are going to be as necessary to the progress of liberty in this dispensation
as are the labors of our Elders. We have got to accept these things. And if
our sons have to go away in the wars, we must arm them with the power of
God, with the power of faith; our prayers must go after them. . . .</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Richard&#8217;s words echoed an earlier statement by the First Presidency which
affirmed the absolute loyalty of the Mormon people. What is unique about his statement,
though, is the emphasis on the necessity of war to further the building of the kingdom.
This idea has continued to be a key feature of official Church statements regarding war
up to the present time. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">With the onset of World War I, we see the prophet at the time, Joseph F. Smith,
struggling to remain neutral to support President Wilson&#8217;s desire for peace while at the
same time facing the grim reality of our country gradually being sucked into the conflict.</span></font></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">
<font color="#000080">According to Dr. Richard F. Bennett, Professor of Church History at BYU,
		<i>&#8220;the sinking
of the Lusitania in May 1915 struck an ominous chord in America, intent as the country
was in staying clear of the conflict.&#8221; </i>As America lurched reluctantly toward war,
President Smith saw America&#8217;s involvement as a necessity. </font></span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>If Latter-day Saints must fight&#8212;and thousands of them soon enlisted in the
cause&#8212;their attitude must ever be that of &#8220;peace and good will toward all
mankind, . . . that they will not forget that they are also soldiers of the
Cross, that they are ministers of life and not of death; and when they go
forth, they may go forth in the spirit of defending the liberties of mankind
rather than for the purpose of destroying the enemy. . . . Let the soldiers
that go out from Utah be and remain men of honor.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As his personal feelings and public pronouncements refined over the course of the war,
the prophet&#8217;s desire for the welfare of young Latter-day Saint men performing their
patriotic duty was paramount in his thoughts and prayers. From the Juvenile Instructor in
1917, we read:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Our country is at war. This regrettable condition has been forced upon us
by enemies of representative government and individual freedom.
Despotism is endeavoring to gain the ascendency and to establish its
might in the earth. Many of our young men who have been reared in the
Church, and taught the principles of the gospel in the Sabbath Schools
and other organizations of the Church, have been called to the colors in
defense of our liberties and the liberty and freedom of the world&#8230;. It
matters not so much when our young men are called, or where they may
go, but it does matter much to their parents, friends and associates in the
truth, and above all to themselves, how they go. They have been trained
all their lives as members of the Church to keep themselves pure and
unspotted from the sins of the world, to respect the rights of others, to be
obedient to righteous principles, to remember that virtue is one of the
greatest gifts from God&#8230;. If they will go forth in this manner, fit
companions for the Spirit of the Lord, free from sin, and trusting in the
Lord, then whatever befalls them they will know that they have found
favor in the sight of God. Should death overtake them while thus engaged
in the discharge of duty in defense of their country, they need have no
fear, for their salvation is assured. </i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Meanwhile, until the war ended, Latter-day Saints joined with others in praying for peace
and in taking up arms in the cause of victory over the enemy. America&#8217;s involvement
eventually turned the tide of war, ultimately bringing a defeated Germany and the other
Axis powers to Versailles. And though half a world away, news of the pending peace was
as jubilantly received in Utah as it was most everywhere else in the free world.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">World Wars I and II impelled the Church to speak about the religious duties of citizens of
warring states, balancing the condemnation of war with statements about civic duties and
the relative justice of the causes and conduct of particular combatants. In the period
before World War II, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., counselor in the First Presidency,
vigorously advocated U.S. neutrality, and opposed the maintenance of a standing army
with equal vigor when hostilities ceased. However, President Clark was the Church
spokesman when it made official declarations encouraging LDS men to respond to their
governments&#8217; call for military service, despite the fact that these decisions were contrary
to his personal viewpoint. In October 1940, he said, <i>&#8220;We shall confidently expect that no
young man member of the Church will seek to evade his full responsibility&#8221;</i> (CR [Oct.
1940]:16). A 1942 First Presidency statement counseled Church members worldwide to
be ready to respond to their government&#8217;s call to military duty and exonerated the
members&#8217; acts of war: <i>&#8220;God . . . will not hold the innocent instrumentalities of the war,
our brethren in arms, responsible for the conflict&#8221; </i>(MFP 6:159). This statement has been
reiterated during each subsequent period of military action. Since World War II, the LDS
stance toward just cause and just conduct in war has provided guides by which to
evaluate participation in specific conflicts without departing either from the obligation of
civic obedience or the generalized condemnation of war. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Out of the agony and devastation of World War II are found remarkable stories of faith

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>There is within the Church a large number of brethren who, as young
men, would have loved to serve a full-time mission. In fact, many of the
General Authorities of the Church were denied this opportunity because of
the untimely intervention of World War II and the Korean War. There is
also a somewhat younger generation whose opportunities for missionary
service were limited by the Vietnam War, during which time only one
young man from each ward was able to serve at a given time. But
regardless of their current age or past circumstances, many of these
brethren quietly served as missionaries in uniform. Some of them assisted
in the teaching and conversion process of pioneer members of the Church
in the countries of Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Others were faithful
examples to their comrades in arms and were instruments in the Lord&#8217;s
hands in bringing their military buddies into the kingdom. </i></span></font>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>One of these great missionaries is my long-time friend Herman Moessner.
Herman was born in Stuttgart, Germany, and joined the Church as a
young man. When World War II began he was drafted into the German
army. During the course of the war he was captured by the British army
and taken to England as a prisoner of war. Moved by the Spirit, and
wishing to use his time wisely, Herman began to share the gospel with his
fellow German soldiers. They had plenty of time to be taught, and though
Herman had not been called and set apart as a full-time missionary, he
was a missionary nevertheless. During that period of time, several of his
friends were baptized into the Church in a makeshift baptismal font. </i></span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Brother Moessner also used this opportunity to learn English as he
conversed with his British prison guards. He practiced his English on any
British guard who was willing to converse with him. His soft voice and
cheerful spirit endeared him to the British, and at the conclusion of the
war his English had become so proficient that he later served as an
interpreter for the visiting General Authorities who came to Germany. He
was called as the first stake president of the Stuttgart Stake after having
served as a counselor to several successive mission presidents. He later
served in the presidency of the Swiss Temple. For Herman Moessner, time
in a British prisoner-of-war camp had not been lost time, but rather a time
of preparation for future service in the kingdom. </i></span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We now move to a discussion of a war that engendered tremendous division and social
upheaval in the United States. The Vietnam War found the leadership of the Church
struggling to remind the Saints of loyalty and duty to country in the wake of increasing
popular disapproval for the war and mistrust of the nation&#8217;s leaders.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Bishop Vaughn J. Featherstone in the October conference of 1975, contrasted Captain
Moroni with those who were critical of the Vietnam War and the U.S. government in
general:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>What a contrast to the attitude of some of our liberals! Someone asked me
once how I felt about amnesty for the draft card burner and the deserter. I
told him that I thought every one of them should be taken before General
Moroni to be judged. We need to feel again what it means to be a citizen
of the United States of America. We need to feel the thrill and sensation
and have the swellings within our bosom about this country. The
priesthood of God should be an example of patriotism and loyalty to our
country. As I talk about the United States of America, each one should
consider his homeland, his flag, and his country. I think it is time we
should all awaken. Our concern isn&#8217;t about the flames of freedom which
burn so brightly in our generation; the concern is that in the upcoming
generation the fire has never been kindled. Our youth have never known
anything but criticism of the United States of America. We need some
faithful, free-loving patriots who will issue forth a clear, loud trumpet
call. Remember Paul&#8217;s counsel: &#8220;For if the trumpet give an uncertain
sound, who shall prepare &#8230; to the battle?&#8221; (1 Corinthians 14:8) Freedom
ought to ring in the heart of every Latter-day Saint regardless of his
country.</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In retrospect, Bishop Featherstone&#8217;s words sound somewhat extreme, but they must be
taken in the context of the time in which they were spoken. The leaders of the Church
faced a rising tide of popular discontent against the War and increasing rebellion among
the youth of the Church in light of prevailing moral and social ambiguities. The general
authorities sought to stem this tide from the pulpit. The more constant tone was one of
faith that the will of the Lord would ultimately prevail despite the horrors of the war and
that Saints who found themselves in Vietnam must hold fast to the iron rod.</span></font></p>

simple answer. The problems are complex almost beyond comprehension.
I seek only to call your attention to that silver thread, small but radiant
with hope, shining through the dark tapestry of war-namely, the
establishment of a bridgehead, small and frail now; but which somehow,
under the mysterious ways of God, will be strengthened, and from which
someday shall spring forth a great work affecting for good the lives of
large numbers of our Father&#8217;s children who live in that part of the world.

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The silver thread of which Elder Hinckley spoke referred not only to the spread of the
gospel within the U.S. military but to the growth of the Church among the Vietnam. A
brief examination of the history of the Church in that land provides an outstanding
example of the way in which the Lord uses the evils of war to accomplish his own divine
purposes. I have chosen to place the story in the context of the life of Cong Ton Nu
Tuong-Vy, or Sister Vy, one of the first Vietnamese Latter-day Saints and the translator
of the Book of Mormon into Vietnamese.</span></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">
<font color="#000080">The arrival of American soldiers to the shores of Vietnam paved the way for missionary
work in that country. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Church thrived. It was
during this time that Sister Vy was hired by the Church to translate some pamphlets. The
work of translation led to her conversion. She then proceeded to translate the Book of
Mormon, stating, </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>In 1970 or 1971, I was extended a calling to translate the Book of
Mormon. When trying to translate the difficult parts, I pondered and
prayed. I would often dream at night about the parts and see where I
could find help in my library. So I began to write. And as I translated, I
pondered. I forgot myself. It was almost as if someone else was helping me
write. If you cannot believe that a young man like Joseph Smith,
uneducated as he was, could translate the Book of Mormon, then consider
my experience. I don&#8217;t know how I was able to translate the book, but
Heavenly Father helped me. The translation is a good one&#8212;many have
studied it and said so. It took me two years to finish.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The translation was smuggled out of Vietnam shortly before South Vietnam succumbed
to Communism in 1975, but Sister Vy was forced to stay behind. Attempted escapes by
boat, imprisonment, and isolation marked this faithful woman&#8217;s life for the next 10 years.
Eventually, she was reduced to disguising herself as an impoverished Buddhist nun and
living in a cave near the seashore. </span></font></p>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The first night alone, I became afraid of my lonely, deserted situation. I
left the cave and knelt down on a rock to pray. Through my tears and my
loneliness, I asked Father in Heaven to give me the courage and strength
to survive this ordeal. A peace and calm came upon me, and I knew that I
could remain there. This is my testimony of prayer. Whenever I have been
upset or have struggled, I have prayed. Heavenly Father always hears and
answers my prayers. He always listens to his children.</i></span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Church actively searched for her, finding her in 1985. She took a bus to Saigon and

Vietnam.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Almost 20 years had passed from the time that Elders Gordon B. Hinckley and Marion D.
Hanks had dedicated the land of Vietnam for the preaching of the gospel. With 90% of
the Vietnamese Saints now outside of the country, one wonders what good it did to
dedicate that country during the war. Yet, one must also remember that the arrival of
servicemen, followed by missionaries, opened up an otherwise closed country to the
initial planting of the gospel seed. In 1993, expatriate members of the Church were
authorized to organize a branch in Hanoi. On 29 May 1996, President Gordon B.
Hinckley returned to Vietnam. While meeting with some Vietnamese Saints, President
Hinckley offered an &#8220;addendum&#8221; to his dedicatory prayer of thirty years earlier,
dedicating the entire country of Vietnam to the spreading of the gospel. By 1999, there
were 100 members meeting in two branches. We must remember that the gospel rolls
forth according to the Lord&#8217;s timetable and not the world&#8217;s.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While I vaguely remember the Vietnam War as a child, with both my father and my
uncle serving in the military during that conflict, my own experiences with war are based
on my service in the Army during the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991 and Operation
Iraqi Freedom in 2004-2005. I want to share a few of my experiences to help you
understand what the Lord expects of us as citizens of nations and to further illustrate how
the evils of war can nevertheless further his eternal purposes. </span></font>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">With many parallels to the Vietnam War in terms of the rationale for the war and the
strategic errors made during the war, the Iraq War is a great laboratory for us to examine
the appropriate response of Latter-day Saints. One cannot go a day without seeing
political commentary from the right or the left regarding the war. I found as many
differences opinion among my fellow soldiers in Iraq as I do among the civilian populace
at home. I am frequently asked, &#8220;Is the situation really as bad as the media portrays it?&#8221; I
get the sense that people who otherwise want to support the President and his national
security policies are frustrated by the lack of progress in the war. Their questions may
betray deeper concerns about the justification of the war. &#8220;Why did we go there in the
first place?&#8221; &#8220;Should we stay?&#8221; &#8220;If the answer is no, am I justified in agitating against the
war and for the return of our soldiers?&#8221; As a soldier, should I try to get out of my
obligation because I don&#8217;t think our cause is just? </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, in 
		my closing remarks, I wish to address the remarkable progress being made in the
Lord&#8217;s kingdom amidst the darkness of what is the Iraq War. While at Fort Lewis
preparing for my deployment overseas, I had occasion to hold a small sacrament service
with a fellow Saint and soldier in the barracks. Even though it brought peace to my heart
and soul to have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament, the experience brought to
mind the small, isolated, and infrequent servicemen&#8217;s group meetings I participated in
while in the Gulf War. Much was my pleasant surprise when I finally arrived at my place
of duty in Iraq to discover that I was now a member of the fledgling Arabian Peninsula
Stake headquartered in Baghdad, with stake membership spread across the entire Persian
Gulf. In addition, I was a member of three branches on the camp. We had as a stake
counselor an LDS chaplain from the Hawaiian National Guard. Under his leadership,
high councilmen and branch presidencies were called, and relief societies and priesthood
quorums were organized. The use of approved church manuals was standardized across
the region. Most gratifying of all were the frequent baptisms of converts, many of whom
had received the seed of faith much earlier and who now found themselves in the right
circumstances to accept the gospel. Though the pace of missionary work among the Iraqi
people is extremely slow due to restrictions on proselyting, I had the opportunity to meet
the first Iraqi Saint, a man with a Christian background who had the gospel introduced to
him by civilian contractors from Utah. None of this may sound very dramatic unless you
put it in the context of a war zone in a Muslim country that was formerly a dictatorship.
Based on my experiences with the gospel there, I have a strong hope that the events that
we are seeing transpire today such as the formation of a new government will eventually
bear fruit for the Lord&#8217;s kingdom . . . but all in his good time.</span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There are three passages of scripture that include lists of spiritual gifts. One is in the New
Testament in Paul&#8217;s first letter to the Corinthians. A second is found in the last chapter of
Moroni as he closes the Book of Mormon record and the third is in the 46<sup>th</sup> section of the
Doctrine and Covenants. These scriptures help us identify a significant and crucial list of
spiritual gifts that are a blessing to us individually and as a Church. Today I would like to use the
words gift and gifts in a broader context than the lists of spiritual gifts found in these three
references in scripture. I will use them in the context of any gift or talent we may have received
from the Lord and will use the terms gift and talent interchangeably.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Have you ever heard it said of someone that he or she is gifted? It means they have a natural
talent or ability in a certain area. Someone might say, &#8220;She is a gifted pianist&#8221; or &#8220;He is a gifted
athlete.&#8221; Did you know each of us is gifted? Every person has a set of gifts or talents. These gifts
come from God. Elder Boyd K. Packer speaking of those gifted in the arts said, 
		<i>&#8220;You who have
such talents might well ask, &#8216;Whence comes this gift?&#8217; And gift it is. You may have cultivated it
and developed it, but it was given to you. Most of us do not have it. You were not more deserving
than we, but you are a good deal more responsible&#8221; </i>(BYU, February 1, 1976).</span><br />

		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">You know what happens in the story when the Lord returns to reckon with his servants. The last
servant was rebuked by the Lord for burying the talent. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Notice that even the person who received one talent recognized it as &#8220;his lord&#8217;s money.&#8221; An
important realization for us to make is that our gifts and talents come from God. Korihor, one of
the Anti-Christs in the Book of Mormon, taught that <i>&#8220;. . . every man fared in this life according
to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and
that every man conquered according to his strength . . .&#8221; </i>(Alma 30:17). This philosophy is also
prevalent in our own day. People are not prone to acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s hand in their lives and
as the source of their abilities and talents.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One of the problems that stems from not realizing the source of our gifts is that we can get a
warped sense of our individual worth. It is wrong to equate our self worth with our particular
gifts. However, many people fall into this trap: they look down on those who don&#8217;t have the
same gifts. For example, someone who is gifted in athletics makes fun of someone who is not
athletic. Conversely, there are many people who feel they are of lesser value because they
compare their lack of a specific gift with someone who has that gift.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We live in a society that values some gifts much more highly than others. Our sense of
individual worth should be based on the fact that each of us is a son or daughter of God. We
have divine parentage and limitless potential. Our worth as an individual is not based on whether
or not we have a particular gift or set of gifts.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let&#8217;s assume you had a friend from a very wealthy family and this friend of yours received an
expensive car as a Christmas gift from her parents. You wouldn&#8217;t think your friend was a better
person because she received an expensive gift&#8212;lucky maybe, but not a better person. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We wouldn&#8217;t judge people better than others based on the gifts they receive for Christmas.
Neither should we judge people&#8217;s worth by the gifts or talents they have received in this life.
Gifts are not earned. Wages are earned. Gifts are not wages.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We have all been given gifts and they come in many varieties. Speaking of spiritual gifts the
Lord explained in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants that <i>&#8220;&#8230;all have not every gift given
unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 46:11).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It has been enlightening to watch as each of my own children has come into the world with a
different set of gifts.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Each individual has gifts and talents in many areas. Some have gifts in academic areas. Have
you ever been in a physics or math class with people who just seem to &#8220;get it&#8221; without much
work? I have a sister who struggled to understand physics and to this day explains physics by
saying it must be black magic. Do you know someone who seems to be able to memorize easily?
Some have artistic gifts. You know people who have natural talent in music or art. I remember in
first grade being embarrassed when all the students had to show the class the pictures we had
drawn. I don&#8217;t happen to have a gift in drawing or painting and still remember the chuckles when
the class saw my picture. Even now I&#8217;m reluctant to draw anything on a blackboard in a class. I
think if they perform an autopsy on me after I die they won&#8217;t find an artistic bone in my body. 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some have abundant athletic gifts. They are exceptionally fast or strong or have very good hand-eye coordination. Others have gifts in mechanical areas. They seem to be able to discern how
things work and know how best to fix a problem. Some people are naturally good in the area of
business. Others have social gifts. We have talents in differing degrees in different areas of our
lives.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Why weren&#8217;t we all just blessed with all gifts? Wouldn&#8217;t that have been easier? Why do we each
just have some? Why did I get the particular gifts I got and you the particular set you have? I&#8217;m
not sure I have the definitive answers to all of these questions, but we can get some hints from
the scriptures. Quoting again from Section 46 where the Lord is discussing spiritual gifts:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It sounds like the distribution of gifts across different people makes it possible for all to be
profited. In 1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 12 the apostle Paul explains different spiritual gifts and in this context

blessings apply to a marriage and a family. Since each family member has different talents, if the
whole family appreciates each person&#8217;s talents the family grows closer together. At the same
time individuals develop their talents and the individual gifts become a blessing to the whole

		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:33). </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Think of how we have been blessed by people who have developed their gifts during their lives
and have used them to bless others. I don&#8217;t think it is a coincidence that President Clark is
leading this University now. He has spent his life developing the talents given to him and
happens to have just the right set needed at this institution now.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is not a coincidence that President Hinckley, with all the gifts he has developed, leads the
Church today. The Lord blesses individuals with certain gifts. If a person develops those gifts the
Lord is able to use that person to help build the kingdom and bless the world. It is interesting to
see how the Lord has called prophets who possessed certain talents at specific times in our day.
Think of Joseph Smith at the outset of this dispensation and how his particular gifts were needed
then. Brigham Young led the Church at a time when his great leadership and organizational
skills were utilized to their fullest as the saints crossed the plains and colonized the West. Heber
J. Grant was gifted in business and finance. It is not surprising he led the Church during the
years of the great depression.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Grant was also known for his willingness to work on areas of his life where he felt he
needed improvement. His example teaches us that in addition to developing the natural talents
that are ours we can even strive to make progress in those areas where we don&#8217;t seem to be over-laden with talent.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There is a familiar story from his life when he determined he would learn how to sing. He was
apparently not gifted in singing but practiced and practiced until he could sing some hymns. He
tells of one instance when he was traveling with two other apostles.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Upon my recent trip to Arizona, I asked Elders Rudger Clawson and J. Golden
Kimball if they had any objections to my singing one hundred hymns that day.
They took it as a joke, and assured me that they would be delighted. We were on
the way from Holbrook to St. Johns, a distance of about sixty miles. After I had
sung about forty times, they assured me that if I sang the remaining sixty they
would be sure to have nervous prostration. I paid no attention whatever to their
appeal, but held them to their bargain and sang the full one hundred. One
hundred and fifteen songs in one day and four hundred in four days, is the largest
amount of practicing I ever did</i> (Improvement Era 3:886-90).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Grant eventually was able to sing some hymns, but never got good enough that he
would have been invited to sing in the tabernacle choir. We too can make progress in areas
where we don&#8217;t have much natural ability.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We need to be careful not to &#8220;coast&#8221; through life because we are gifted in certain areas. There
are some people who are very gifted academically and are able to get through school without
really developing their gifts as they should. They are good enough that they can get decent
grades without working too hard. It sounds like an envious situation to be in, but it is actually a
little too much like burying a talent. A person truly develops their gifts as they diligently work in
that area. You may have heard the comment about a lazy athlete, &#8220;What a waste of talent!&#8221;
People can see a person has a lot of natural ability but they are really just coasting on that ability
rather than putting their heart into it.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is easy to develop pride in aspects of our lives where we are gifted and envy based on those
areas where we are not gifted. It is interesting that in areas where we are gifted we want to be
judged on the curve with those who don&#8217;t have the same abilities. In areas we don&#8217;t seem to be
talented we readily see it isn&#8217;t fair to be judged against those who are very talented.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Since these gifts come from God some may wonder why some people have been blessed with
amazing talents when their personal lives have not been lived righteously. There is not a direct
correlation between the natural talents a person has been given in this life and his or her personal
conduct. Many people who are acknowledged as being gifted in certain areas do not live up to
the light available to them. President Spencer W. Kimball explained:</span></font></p>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>It has been said that many of the great artists were . . . moral degenerates. In
spite of their immorality they became great and celebrated artists. What could be
the result if discovery were made of equal talent in men who were clean and free
from the vices, and thus entitled to revelations? . . . </i>(Spencer W. Kimball, &#8220;The
Gospel Vision of the Arts,&#8221; <i>Ensign, </i>July 1977).</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Kimball also made a point about the difference that could be made by a gifted person
who had a knowledge of the fullness of the gospel. He said:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Take a da Vinci or a Michelangelo or a Shakespeare and give him a total
knowledge of the plan of salvation of God and personal revelation and cleanse
him, and then take a look at the statues he will carve and the murals he will paint
and the masterpieces he will produce. Take a Handel with his purposeful effort,
his superb talent, his earnest desire to properly depict the story, and give him
inward vision of the whole true story and revelation, and what a master you have!

		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There are some extremely gifted people who use their gifts to contribute to evil. Some of the
most talented people in the movie industry have produced movies that, in Mormon&#8217;s words,<i> &#8220;. . .
inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil . . .&#8221;</i> (Moroni 7:12). Others with great
abilities in literature or the visual arts have created works with the same effect. Think of the
irony of this. A person has a gift from God. If he perverts the use of this gift it can become a tool
to lead people away from the very being who bestowed the gift! It isn&#8217;t just artistic gifts that can
be misused. Scientific, political, leadership, business or any of these divine gifts can be used
improperly. Some gifted athletes end up being terrible role models to young people who look up
to them. Don&#8217;t ever be persuaded to misuse the gifts you have been given. If your efforts invite
and entice others to do good and to love God and to serve him you are on the right track (see
Moroni 7:13).</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What are your gifts or talents? Are you developing them? Are you using your gifts to build the
kingdom?</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My mother was gifted with children and was an excellent teacher. She was able to attend
graduate school and taught child development at the university level before she was married and
had a family. After she was married she focused her gifts with children and her teaching abilities
on her own family. My father told me that her focus became the family and that she never
wished she were back in the university classroom. I have a hunch she never had a chance to
think about it since she ended up with eight children that I&#8217;m sure pushed her gifts to the limit.
Her efforts and focus further developed the natural gifts she had. Not long before she passed
away she told me that she was a better grandmother than she was a mother because of the things
she had learned.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Lord has blessed you with a unique set of gifts. They have been given to you for a reason.
Don&#8217;t complain because you don&#8217;t have someone else&#8217;s gifts. Find your own. Explore them.
Develop them. Bless others with them. This will bring you great joy.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Savior, who possesses all good gifts, offers some gifts to every person. These are available
because of His infinite atonement. Each of us has the gift of forgiveness available to us. Because
He atoned for our sins we can be forgiven of them if we will just repent. Each of us will receive
the gift of the resurrection and receive an immortal body free from the challenges our mortal
bodies face. The greatest gift offered to humans is offered to all. If we keep his commandments
and endure to the end we <i>&#8220;. . . shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of
God&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 14:7).</span><br /></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know that we are children of a loving Heavenly Father and that through His Son we can receive
the gift of eternal life. To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">On April 1<sup>st 
		</sup>of this year, I was in Salt Lake City to attend general conference. I awoke early and
read the scriptures. My mind was drawn to the Savior&#8217;s introduction of the sacrament in 3<sup>
</sup>Nephi.
That morning I read these words in the 18<sup>th</sup> chapter, beginning in verse 7:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body . . . And it shall be a testimony
unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember
me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And this . . . ye shall do . . . in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for
you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if
ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my
rock</i> (3 Nephi 18:7, 11-12).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Two things in this passage struck me. First, I had never before connected partaking of the
sacrament and remembering the Savior with building on the rock of Christ. But they are so
clearly connected! Secondly, the Savior placed great emphasis on remembering. It was, in fact,
the whole point of taking the sacrament: to bear witness that we do always remember Him, that
we might have His Spirit to be with us. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the conference sessions on that Saturday, there were three talks that addressed what I had read
that morning. Elder Eyring spoke about the rock of Christ and becoming as a child; Elder Bednar
spoke about always having the Spirit to be with us; and Elder Perry spoke about the sacrament.
Three talks&#8212;all connected to the sacrament, all connected to remembering the Savior, and all
connected to building on the rock of Christ. I had been prepared to see those connections and
prompted in a way that helped me pay close attention to them. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the weeks that followed, I studied and prayed about the principles taught in those
talks&#8212;particularly the process of remembering the Savior. I would like to talk today about what
it means to &#8220;Always Remember Him&#8221; and what we can do to make that commandment a reality
in our lives. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Remember</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My starting point today is the word &#8220;remember.&#8221; The word &#8220;remember&#8221; comes from the Latin
word <i>memor </i>and means mindful, remembering, grateful, thoughtful, or prudent. In modern usage
it is most often associated with recalling something from memory or retaining something in
memory. This kind of remembering happens many times each day (actually, if you are over 50 it
happens less than you would like!). But there is a kind of remembering that is much deeper and
requires much more of us. In this deeper sense, we use &#8220;remember&#8221; to mean: hold in the mind
for consideration or attention; commemorate, and give honor, respect or reverence to someone or
something. Abraham Lincoln used this sense of remember in his Gettysburg Address when he
said: <i>&#8220;The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
what they did here&#8221; </i>(Gary Wills, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America</span>
(Touchstone, New York, 1992), p. 263. Note that Lincoln was dead wrong about the memory of
his words).</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This deep remembering begins with a recalling to mind, not just of facts, but also of experiences.
We recall what we have seen and heard and felt. But deep remembering goes beyond recall. As
we reflect and ponder, we forge a bond that connects our memories to our emotional
commitments and our sense of honor and reverence. We focus on the meaning and purpose of
what we have experienced and what we have learned. This is deep remembering. 
		</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I believe it is this meaning that we ought to apply when we speak of remembering the Savior. I
believe that what the Lord wants us to do is to &#8220;deeply remember&#8221; Him. Deep remembering
requires that we bring to mind and commemorate what He has done and will yet do, that we
might honor Him and reverence Him. Deep remembering engages our emotions, our spirits, our
desires, and our commitments. It is all about who we are and what we want to become. Deep
remembering requires that we bring the Savior&#8212;His suffering and sacrifice, His glorious
resurrection, His mercy and grace and power, and all that we have experienced through
Him&#8212;into that central part of ourselves wherein lies motivation, commitment, desire, faith,
hope, and love. The command is to get the Savior in there, to invite Him into that part of us, to
deeply remember Him and all He is and does&#8212;there, deep in the very heart of who we are and
what we hope and what we want. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Listen to the way the Lord describes this remembering. In the second verse of the 27<sup>th</sup> section of
the Doctrine and Covenants He says:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye
shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it
		<span style="font-weight: bold">with an eye
single to my glory&#8212;remembering unto the Father</span> my body which was laid down
for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins</i> (Doctrine
and Covenants 27:2, emphasis added). </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The remembering here is not simply recall. This remembering has purpose and focus and
motivation; it is remembering to bring commitment and honor and glory to the Lord. This
remembering is &#8220;unto the Father&#8221;&#8212;an expression of gratitude for the mercy and forgiveness and
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is deep remembering. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Salience and Power of Remembering</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Lord puts so much emphasis on deep remembering because it is so powerful and so
fundamental to who we are and what we do. Deeply remembering something or someone or
some principle motivates much of what we do in our daily lives. Because deep remembering is
so powerful, and so ingrained in us, Satan works hard to counterfeit and corrupt it. Our Heavenly
Father wants us to always deeply remember the Savior instead of all the other things that might
take His place. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The prophets have repeatedly warned us about the counterfeit and corrupt objects of our deep
remembering. The Old Testament is full of stories of the children of Israel forgetting the Lord
and remembering instead the false gods and dumb idols of the Egyptians, or the Philistines, or
the Canaanites. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the New Testament, the Savior said of the Pharisees: they<i> &#8220;. . . love the uppermost rooms at
feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues&#8221; </i>(Matthew 23:6). They deeply remembered the
rules and procedures, the ceremonies, and the rituals<i> &#8220;. . . to be seen of men . . . &#8221; 
		</i>(Matthew
23:5); but they forgot <i>&#8220;. . . judgment, mercy, and faith . . .&#8221;</i> (Matthew 23:23). In Luke 16:15, He
said: <i>&#8220;. . . Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for
that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God </i>(Luke 16:15).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the Book of Mormon, the prophets warned the Nephites repeatedly about setting their hearts
on wealth and power, costly apparel, the pleasures of the flesh, and their own wisdom. In Alma
4:6-8 Mormon describes such wickedness in these words:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . the people of the Church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding
riches . . . and in all these things <span style="font-weight: bold">were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes</span> . . .
.</i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . and . . . began . . . to set their hearts upon . . . the vain things of the world . . .
		</i>(Alma 4:6, 8, emphasis added).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This phrase 
		<i>&#8220;lifted up in the pride of their eyes&#8221; </i>underscores the power of 
		<i>&#8220;being seen of men.&#8221;
</i>Behind such behavior lies deep remembering. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In our day President Spencer W. Kimball spoke forcefully against such idolatry among the
Latter-day Saints. In his talk &#8220;The False Gods We Worship,&#8221; he said:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The Lord has blessed us as a people with a prosperity unequaled in times past . . .
But I am afraid that many of us have been surfeited with flocks and herds and
acres and barns and wealth and have begun to worship them as false gods . . . 
Many people spend most of their time working in the service of a self-image that
includes sufficient money, stocks, bonds, investment portfolios, property, credit
cards, furnishings, automobiles, and the like to guarantee carnal security
throughout, it is hoped, a long and happy life</i> (Spencer W. Kimball, &#8220;The False
Gods We Worship,&#8221; Ensign, June 1976, 3).</span><br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we fall into the trap that President Kimball describes, we serve an image of ourselves defined
by the world&#8217;s version of the good life. It is as if the standards of society and the ways of the
world create a mirror in which we examine our dress, our possessions, our behavior, and our
activities to find what is accepted and validated. The &#8220;mirror of the world&#8221; (see end note) throws
up an image of what is fashionable and popular and attractive, and it is this image that becomes
the focus of our deep remembering. It is in the mirror of the world that we are 
		<i>&#8220;. . . lifted up in
the pride of </i>[our] <i>eyes . . . &#8221; </i>(Alma 4:6).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">An experience I had early in my life may help to illustrate the power of the mirror of the world.
When I was 12 years old, I attended Sacajawea Junior High School in Spokane, Washington. I
had moved to Spokane the year before, and my sixth grade year had been wonderful. I enjoyed
school, did well, and played a lot of sports. I had been ordained a deacon, and I enjoyed church.
Seventh grade, however, was a very difficult experience. It all started with the first report card. I
had worked hard and enjoyed that first term, and I got straight A&#8217;s. I was off to a good start. But
once the kids in my grade found out I got straight A&#8217;s, the scorn and ridicule began. They called
me names; made fun of me; and most painful of all, they would not have anything to do with me.
Who were these people, and why did I care so much? </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In that first term I had gravitated toward what seemed like the really &#8220;cool&#8221; kids&#8212;the kids who
were &#8220;in,&#8221; the kids who were &#8220;popular.&#8221; In our school, if you wanted to be cool, you needed to
remember the cool kids and their ways when you decided what to wear, how to act, where to go,
and what to do. In effect, the cool society at Sacajawea Junior High School created a social
standard those who wanted to be like them had to follow. It was as if there was a constant
message on the school&#8217;s loudspeaker system: &#8220;If you want to be cool, deeply remember who the
cool kids are. Remember how they dress and talk, where they go, and what they do. If you want
to be cool, you must remember to be like them. Look into the mirror of the world, and you will
see what you can be if you remember to be cool.&#8221; </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Well, straight A&#8217;s was not on the list and I was definitely not cool. But the mirror of the world,
the lure of the &#8220;in group,&#8221; and the process of remembering them and trying to pattern myself
after them remained with me until the middle of my senior year in high school. It was also true, I
am grateful to say, that the Church and the gospel and remembering the Savior were important
parts of my life. There was, in a very real way, something like a battle going on inside of me
during my teenage years. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That battle was all about the focus of deep remembering in my life. It was all about deciding
which mirror I would look to for guidance and direction: the mirror of the world or the mirror of
Christ. Paul taught this concept of the mirror of Christ in 2<sup> </sup>Corinthians 3:18 (note here that the
word glass is used to mean mirror): <i>&#8220;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord&#8221;</i> (2 Corinthians 3:18).</span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When Alma asked the people of Zarahemla,
		<i>&#8220;Have ye received his image in your
countenances?&#8221; </i>(Alma 5:14) he was asking them about looking into the mirror of Christ. James
used the same metaphor when he taught the importance of putting faith into action. In James
1:23-25 we read:</span></font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Taken together, these two passages teach us that we create the mirror of Christ by deeply
remembering Him and that, when we look for guidance in the mirror of Christ, the Light of
Christ illuminates the choices we face and the Holy Ghost brings to our remembrance (see John
14:26) the words of Christ and the voice of Christ&#8212;as well as feelings, insights, and inspiration
centered on Him. We see ourselves in the mirror of Christ as He sees us, and we see our actions
and our behavior as He sees them and as He would have them be. We see Him as He really is;
and we, therefore, see ourselves as we might really become. Moreover, as we act on what we
see, as our deep remembering moves us to do what is right, we become more like Him. 
		</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The mirror of the world that I paid so much attention to at Sacajawea Junior High School pales
in comparison to the mirror of Christ. Consider the differences I saw when I was 12 years old. In
the mirror of the world, I saw myself in the inner circle. I saw how to act and what to wear and
what to do to be accepted and popular and cool. I saw the junior high version of the great and
spacious building. What would I have seen in the mirror of Christ, if I had looked? I would have
seen a young man, a child of God, born in the covenant of wonderful parents, blessed with the
gift of the Holy Ghost, holding the Aaronic Priesthood, preparing to become an elder in Israel. I
would have seen the Savior with the arm of mercy extended to me. I would have remembered
His voice and felt the echoes of heaven where I knew Him and followed Him. I would have seen
repentance and forgiveness and the power of the Atonement. If I had looked even harder, I
would have seen myself serving a mission, endowed with power from on High. I would have
seen myself kneeling at the altar of the temple with a righteous, faithful, glorious daughter of
God. I would have seen children and grandchildren; and service in the Kingdom; and joy untold;
and peace, and knowledge, and power through Christ. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Compared to the mirror of Christ, the mirror of the world is a poor counterfeit of the real thing,
the real remembering. It is like the difference between a set of flashing neon lights and the light
of the sun. The neon lights are colorful and catchy, but ultimately, artificial, cold, shallow, and
dead. The light of the sun is rich and bright, warm, deep, and full of life. I am so grateful that I
discovered that difference in my teenage years. I had both mirrors before me, and there was a
struggle. But I looked to Christ and remembered Him and chose the Light. </span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Deep Remembering</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How do we make the commandment to<i> &#8220;always remember Him&#8221; 
		</i>a reality in our lives? It is so
all encompassing! Think of what it means to deeply remember the Lord Jesus Christ and all that
He is, all that He has done and will do, at all times, in every circumstance, in all of our ways,
without fail. What can we do to create the mirror of Christ and make it a central part of how we
choose and act and decide? </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Alma addressed just this question in his masterful interview with his son Helaman. His words in
Alma 37:36-37 give us the pattern we need to follow to &#8220;always remember the Savior&#8221;:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be
directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord
forever.</i></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There are four, interrelated elements in Alma&#8217;s pattern for deep remembering:

<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in"><font color="#000080">

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8226;Let Your Heart Be Full of Thanks Unto God</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let&#8217;s examine each one of them in turn.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Cry Unto God for All Your Support</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To cry to the Lord for our support involves both our regular, everyday lives, and the significant,
challenging episodes we all encounter as part of mortal existence. We are after the Lord&#8217;s help in
matters temporal and spiritual, and we seek that support through prayer. Amulek taught us to
pray about everything&#8212;crops and fields, all of our household, against the power of our enemies,
for mercy and salvation (see Alma 34:18-25). In Alma 34:37 he also taught that those prayers
ought to never end: <i>&#8220;Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn
out in <span style="font-weight: bold">prayer unto him continually</span> for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are
around you&#8221;</i> (Alma 34:27, emphasis added).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The prophets have taught us that the Lord hears and answers such prayers, both about daily life
and about the burdens and challenges we face. Such prayers and such reliance grow out of faith
in the Lord Jesus Christ and trust in His power and love. As Alma said in Alma 36:3: 
		<i>&#8220;. . . for I
do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their
troubles and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day&#8221;</i> (Alma 36:3).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith the same principle with these words in Doctrine and
Covenants 3:8: <i>&#8220;Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and
supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in
every time of trouble&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 3:8).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Part of deep remembering in the mirror of Christ is to see and know the Savior as one who
knows us, loves us, and extends <i>&#8220;. . . the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him&#8221;
		</i>(Mosiah 29:20). He, indeed, is with us in every time of trouble and in every other time as well.
To deeply remember Him is to turn to Him for all our support. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Let All Your Doings Be Unto the Lord</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">All our doings encompass our every waking hour&#8212;at home, at work, at school, at play, in the
neighborhood, running errands, whatever we do, wherever we go. Doing all of this 
		<i>&#8220;unto the
Lord&#8221; </i>is, in the first instance, all about priority and obedience. It is about making all our doings
consistent with what we know to be true&#8212;the gospel and the Lord&#8217;s commandments. It is all
about repentance and putting our lives in order. It is about building an eternal family and being
part of the Kingdom of God&#8212;going to church, magnifying callings, bringing up 
		<i>&#8220;. . . children in
light and truth&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 93:40). But secondly, it is all about humility and a
willingness to listen. It is about the guidance of the Spirit and being directed in what we do. It
means listening to the voice of the Lord. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Holy Ghost gives us the capacity to hear the voice of the Lord. To help us remember Him,
the Savior speaks to us and calls us to follow Him and to do His work. That call comes not once
but many, many times. It is not limited to only one part of our lives or to certain times in the day.
It is comprehensive and complete and all encompassing. If we hear that voice and deeply
remember Him and heed that call, we will be in the service of the Lord. As we look into the
mirror of Christ, we will come to know His voice and to know Him. He will qualify us for His
work and magnify us in our capacity, and all of our doings will be unto the Lord.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Let Your Thoughts and the Affections of Your Heart Be Upon the Lord Forever</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In His earthly ministry, the Savior taught that the first and great commandment is to love God
with all our hearts, might, mind, and strength. His invitation to &#8220;come unto me&#8221; is an invitation
to give our hearts and minds to Him. In deeply remembering the Savior, the life of the mind and
the life of the heart must be deeply connected in Him. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Directing our minds to the Lord is all about seeking truth. The gospel encompasses all truth, and
the Lord has commanded us to <i>&#8220;. . . seek learning, even by study and also by faith&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine
and Covenants 88:118). This means, first and foremost, searching the scriptures and the words of
the prophets. It means seeking words of wisdom out of the best books and searching for truth
wherever it may be found (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:118). It means that we are to 
		<i>&#8220;teach
</i>[one another]<i> . . . all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants
88:78). It means doing all this under the direction of the Holy Ghost, whose ministry is to 
		<i>&#8220;. . .
teach you all things&#8221; </i>(John 14:26).</span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Placing our affections upon the Lord is about the desires of our hearts and our deepest
commitments. It is about making eternal covenants through sacred ordinances to serve Him, to
be a witness for Him, and to keep His commandments. We make those promises at baptism and
in the temple. The Lord has made it possible for us to renew those covenants regularly through
the ordinance of the sacrament and through participation in the ordinances of the temple on
behalf of those who have died. If those covenants become our deepest commitments, if we are
true and faithful to them, we come to truly love the Lord. Thus, we place our affections upon the
Lord forever by making and keeping sacred covenants. </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We also gain access to the power and influence of the Holy Ghost. When we are true and faithful
to our covenants, the Holy Ghost ignites the Light of Christ in us. Our minds become
enlightened and our understanding quickened. Thus, the life of the mind and the life of the heart
are deeply connected in Christ. Indeed, the Lord has promised us that those who are true and
faithful <i>&#8220;. . . </i>[receive] <i>truth and light, until </i>[they are] 
		<i>glorified in truth and </i>[know] <i>all things&#8221;
</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 93:28). This is what we see in the mirror of Christ. Seeking truth and
keeping covenants are thus integral parts of deeply remembering Him. </span><br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Let Your Heart be Full of Thanks Unto God</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Over and over again the prophets throughout the ages have joined with Alma to admonish us to
give thanks to God. The Lord himself gave perhaps the most powerful statement of the
paramount importance of gratitude in the 59<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants. After
commanding us to <i>&#8220;. . . thank the Lord thy God in all things,&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 59:7) the
Savior commands us to keep the Sabbath day holy, and promises that <i>&#8220;. . . inasmuch as ye do
these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances . . . the fulness of the earth
is yours . . .&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 59:15-16).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But in verse 21 those who do not keep the Sabbath and do not give thanks to God are warned:
&#8220;<i>And in nothing doth man offend God or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who
confess not his hand in all things . . . </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 59:21).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I believe that the central importance of gratitude grows out of the process we go through when
we express our thanks to our Heavenly Father. When I was a little boy, my mom and dad taught
me to say my prayers. They taught me to thank Heavenly Father for my blessings&#8212;for them, for
Jesus, for my new bike, for my little sister, for my new baby brother. That pattern has stayed
with me to this day. If that expression of thanks in my prayers is not mechanical, or done by rote,
it becomes a time of reflection, of recognition, and affirmation. It becomes a time of deep
remembering in the mirror of Christ. When I thank my Heavenly Father that I have the great
blessing of being married to Sue, I not only affirm my love and gratitude for her, but I recognize
the Lord&#8217;s hand in bringing us together, His mercy and grace in providing us with temples and
the sealing power of the priesthood, and His many tender mercies in helping us and supporting
us in our marriage over these many years. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When I thank my Heavenly Father for the plan of salvation and for the marvelous blessing of the
Atonement of the Savior, I affirm my faith in Jesus Christ. But I also recognize my true
relationship to Him. He is the Creator; the Savior and Redeemer; the only source of salvation,
healing, and forgiveness. He is the way to life, peace, joy, and exaltation. Without Him there
would be no hope, no light, no life. The good things of the earth and the good things of heaven
come to us through Him. Well did King Benjamin say, <i>&#8220;. . . O how you ought to thank your
heavenly King!&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 2:19).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This is the power of gratitude and thanksgiving. If we seek to find and express thanksgiving to
our Heavenly Father and to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, we will see and understand our true
relationship to Them and, through the Holy Ghost, we will receive a witness of that truth. That
witness will burn within us. That is deep remembering in the mirror of Christ. And that is why
Alma said to Helaman: <i>&#8220;. . . when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto
God . . .&#8221; </i>(Alma 37:37).</span></font></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Testimony and Conclusion</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, my dear brothers and sisters, I would like to close with a word of testimony. I hope and
pray that deep remembering in the mirror of Christ will be a reality in our lives. It is my hope
that the very next time we take the sacrament, when we reach to take the bread and the water,
that we say in our hearts: &#8220;I take this bread and water as a witness to my Heavenly Father that I
actually do always remember His Beloved Son. There is nothing else in His place&#8212;not the &#8220;in
crowd&#8221; at Sacajawea Junior High School, not fine-twined linens, or the vain things and the false
gods of the world. I call on Him for all my support, all my doings are unto Him. I search the
scriptures to hear His voice. I renew my covenants with Him, and I am true and faithful to them.
I give thanks unto Him all the days of my life. He is at the center of my life; He is my Savior, my
Redeemer. In Him I have light and life, faith and hope. I love Him and honor Him and praise His
name. In very fact, in every way, the mirror of Christ is before me always; I always remember
Him.&#8221;</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I pray that it may be so for each one of us. I bear witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know He
lives. This is His church and kingdom, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. His arm of
mercy is extended to us. I know that mercy. The Atonement is real. He is real. May we
always&#8212;<span style="text-decoration: underline">always</span>&#8212;remember Him. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I am indebted to my friend Tony Kimball&#8217;s long ago Sunday School lesson on responsibility for
the notion of a personal mirror&#8212;one version of which I have called the &#8220;mirror of the world.&#8221;
Carl Rogers&#8217; work on the self suggests that one&#8217;s self-image is like looking in a social mirror.
Rogers developed the idea that individuals create a self-concept that involves perception (and
thus an image) of one&#8217;s relationship to others and to other things (see: Carl Rogers,

Becoming a Person</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1961)). For additional work along these lines,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Good morning. I am grateful to have the assignment to be with you today. I compliment you for
taking time to continue your religious education. In April conference of 1852, President Brigham
Young told the Saints:</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>There are a great many branches of education: some go to college to learn
languages, some to study law, some to study physics, and some to study
astronomy, and various other branches of science. We want every branch of
science taught in this place that is taught in the world. But our favorite study is
that branch which particularly belongs to the Elders of Israel </i>[and I might add to
the Sisters of Israel]<i>&#8212;namely, theology. Every Elder </i>[and I would again add
every Sister] <i>should understand this branch better than all the world </i>(<i>Journal of
Discourses</i> 6:317). </span><br /></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Your attendance at this education week is certainly in the spirit of that prophetic counsel.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I understand I am somewhat of a keynote speaker today and it is suggested I address the
theme of this year&#8217;s education week which is taken from the 36<sup>th</sup> chapter of Alma in the Book of
Mormon. I hope it hasn&#8217;t been presumptuous of me, and it is probably evidence of my free spirit,
but I&#8217;ve never felt obligated to stick to prescribed themes. Hopefully, my approach is justified in
light of the revelation which says, <i>&#8220;But not withstanding those things which are written, it has
always been given to the elders of my Church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to conduct
all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Ghost&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 46:2).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">However, in this case, I have been so fascinated with the chosen theme that I&#8217;ve decided for
better or worse to stick with it! Part of my attraction to the theme is that it comes in the midst of
a spiritually candid father and son conversation in which Alma tells Helaman both good and bad
things about Alma&#8217;s past. I know it is usually wise to teach from our strengths, but I wonder
sometimes if our youth today might be encouraged more in their attempts to confess and forsake
their sins if they heard some of us older folks admit, at least in a general way, that we made a
few mistakes ourselves in years past.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">So, in Alma chapter 36 we have Alma bearing his soul and his testimony to Helaman, telling him
how tormented he once was by his sins and then sharing his joy as he repented and felt forgiven.
His effort to convey to his son these things of his soul is recorded in these words:
		<i>&#8220; . . . so
exquisite and sweet . . . was my joy&#8221; </i>that <i>&#8220;methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God
sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of
singing and praising their God&#8221; </i>(Alma 36:21-22). And then in the midst of Alma&#8217;s recounting
his transcendent gaze into heaven, he affirms to Helaman,<i> &#8220;yea, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">my soul did long to be
there</span>&#8221; </i>(emphasis added). What a wonderful thought-provoking statement and appropriate 
theme for this education week. </span><br /></font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8220;And my soul did long to be there.&#8221; 
		</i>I must confess that in all my previous readings and study of
the Book of Mormon this sentence had gone largely unnoticed. But now, for me&#8212;and I hope for
you&#8212;it has become one of those priceless passages of scripture that the Prophet Joseph said
		<i>&#8220;enter with great force into the feeling of </i>[our hearts]<i>&#8221;</i> (<i>Joseph Smith History</i> 1:12). I bet it did
into Helaman&#8217;s.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When I first began to think about Alma&#8217;s statement as I prepared for my talk today, I was
impressed that it evidences both the power of desire (<i>&#8220;my soul did long&#8221;</i>) and the critical
importance of the objects of our desire (<i>&#8220;to be there&#8221;</i>). I wondered what there might be about
being where God is that would cause Alma to long to be there? Why would he or we, as
thoroughly enmeshed as we are in earthly matters, desire something as seemingly ethereal as to
be where God is? As begotten sons and daughters of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:24),
we surely come to earth with an inborn affinity for Him (and parenthetically for his beloved
companion, our mother in heaven) and thus we quite naturally want to be where they are. We
know from modern revelation that <i>&#8220;Man was also in the beginning with God&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 93:23, 29). It just seems spiritually intuitive to me that those who were with God in
the beginning will yearn to be with Him in the end. Provided, of course, they continue to see
things <i>&#8220;as they really are and as they really will be&#8221; </i>(Jacob 4:13). I am also confident that the
prospect of such a destiny was shared with us as part of our <i>&#8220;first lessons in the world of
spirits,&#8221; </i>taught to us even before we were born, as revealed to President Joseph F. Smith in his
vision of that world (Doctrine and Covenants 138:56). Surely, even though as a concession to
agency a veil of forgetfulness has been drawn across our minds, some echoes of the teachings
and experiences of that premortal world can occasionally still be heard through the veil,
especially by those who intently listen. Just as surely, too, those echoes are calling us back to our
heavenly home.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have always been intrigued that some members of the animal kingdom possess a strong homing
instinct. Trout, salmon, some varieties of birds, and even dogs, cats, and other domestic animals
have an attachment to home and an uncanny ability to return there, often over great distances.
Experiments have been conducted in which starlings have returned to their nests after being
transported 500 miles from home and swallows 1,100 miles. A bird known as a Manx
Sheerwater returned from Massachusetts to Britain, a distance of over 3,000 miles across the
Atlantic Ocean in 12&#189; days (see<i> The New Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, 1998, Vol. 14, p. 789). This
being the week of primary elections, at least in Utah, I am reminded of President Boyd K. Packer
telling us once that as a boy he trained homing pigeons. Because it was so difficult to get
election results to the county clerk in Brigham City in a timely way from the distant
communities of Grouse Creek and Park Valley in Box Elder County, his pigeons were employed
to assist. They were transported by car to those towns and on election night the results were
written on small pieces of paper by the judges of election and were then slipped into tiny
pouches attached to the pigeons&#8217; legs. The birds were released and quickly flew the 100 miles or
so to President Packer&#8217;s coop in Brigham City. He then retrieved the results and took them
immediately to the nearby clerk&#8217;s office! I know this sounds terribly outdated in this day of
computerized voting, but it does show that the homing instinct of which I speak can have even
commercial value! There is obviously something built into birds of this type that brings them
home.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I believe in like manner, we were created instinctively to return to the place of our spiritual
beginnings. The author of Ecclesiastes eloquently expressed this thought by saying of God&#8217;s
children, <i>&#8220;</i>[God] <i>hath set the eternal in their heart . . .&#8221; 
		</i>(Ecclesiastes 3:11; see footnote b). Thus,
Alma&#8217;s <i>&#8220;longing to be there&#8221; </i>may be a God-given heavenly homesickness in which we all share.
Perhaps the old saying, &#8220;there is no place like home&#8221; has an eternal dimension we haven&#8217;t fully
appreciated.</span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The desire we feel to be with our Heavenly Parents can&#8217;t be completely explained by our divine
heritage. We just don&#8217;t automatically love our earthly parents because we bear their genes. We
love them mostly because of our experiences and relationships with them and because they love
us. Alma&#8217;s longing to be with God is therefore a wonderful commentary on the depth of his
conversion and personal relationship with God. One of the blessings of Joseph Smith&#8217;s
experience in the sacred grove was to make known how near and accessible God really is. I am
deeply moved each time I read Enoch&#8217;s conversation with God in which he confirms that
accessibility even in the midst of the vast cosmos. In his words:</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea,
millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy
creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still </i>[God is still in production]; 
		<i>and
yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art
merciful and kind forever </i>(Moses 7:30).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Enoch&#8217;s description of God&#8217;s attributes is tremendously encouraging and inviting. To come to
know God is to come to know He is there and to experience His mercy and kindness. I am
personally grateful to have felt God&#8217;s involvement and love in my life. I felt it as a boy when I
was close to nature, animals, and the changing seasons. I felt it in my adolescence as I struggled
to find my place and worth in the world. I have felt it in times of discouragement and temptation
when I&#8217;ve fallen short of my own expectations and of His. I&#8217;ve felt it as a father and husband as
each of our eight children was born, coming fresh from Him. I felt it as my father and mother,
each in turn, left this life for the next. I feel His love today, in this very moment, and I am
grateful for it. I&#8217;m convinced that Alma felt it too, and that those feelings are a prime reason for
his &#8220;longing to be there.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Because of Christ&#8217;s unique role in relation to this world, most direct human encounters with
Deity have been with Him rather than God the Father. As Jesus taught, however, 
		<i>&#8220;The Son can
do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever
		</i>[the Father]<i> doeth,
these also doeth the Son likewise&#8221; </i>(John 5:19). I think therefore we can safely assume if one
experiences Christ&#8217;s love, he experiences the love of God. I say this by way of preface because
during his service as an Apostle, Elder Melvin J. Ballard related the following sacred experience
concerning Christ&#8217;s love: </span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Away on the Fort Peck Reservation where I was doing missionary work with some
of our brethren, laboring among the Indians, seeking the Lord for light to decide
certain matters pertaining to our work there, and receiving a witness from him
that we were doing things according to his will, I found myself one evening in the
dreams of the night in that sacred building, the temple. After a season of prayer
and rejoicing I was informed that I should have the privilege of entering into one
of those rooms, to meet a glorious Personage, and, as I entered the door, I saw,
seated on a raised platform, the most glorious Being my eyes have ever beheld or
that I ever conceived existed in all the eternal worlds. As I approached to be
introduced, he arose and stepped towards me with extended arms, and he smiled
as he softly spoke my name. If I shall live to be a million years old, I shall never
forget that smile. He took me into his arms and kissed me, pressed me to his
bosom, and blessed me, until the marrow of my bones seemed to melt! When he
had finished, I fell at his feet, and, as I bathed them with my tears and kisses, I
saw the prints of the nails in the feet of the Redeemer of the world. The feeling
that I had in the presence of him who hath all things in his hands, to have his
love, his affection, and his blessing was such that if I ever can receive that of
which I had but a foretaste, I would give all that I am, all that I ever hope to be,
to feel what I then felt! </i>(Bryant S. Hinckley, <i>Sermons and Missionary Services of
Melvin J. Ballard</i>, 1949, Deseret Book, p. 156).</span><br /></font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What more can be said about God&#8217;s love and the desirability of being where God is? Perhaps at
least this much: In John 3:16 it is written that <i>&#8220;God so loved the world that he gave . . .&#8221; 
		</i>What
he gave as mentioned in that passage was <i>&#8220;his only begotten son,&#8221; 
		</i>the most valuable of all gifts.
But giving with God doesn&#8217;t stop there. As Paul taught the Corinthians, <i>&#8220;Eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
them that love him&#8221; </i>(1 Corinthians 2:9). Ultimately, everything the <i>&#8220;Father hath shall be given
unto </i>[us]<i>&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 84:38), and all He asks in return is that we love Him and
keep His commandments. We speak sometimes of sacrificing for God&#8217;s kingdom, but there must
be a better word. How can it be a sacrifice when what we offer up is comparable to a handful of
dust and what we&#8217;re promised in return are worlds without number? Though we know relatively
little about the particulars of life with God, the promises He has made concerning eternal life or
life with God certainly give hope and contribute greatly to our &#8220;longing to be there.&#8221;</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I wish now to say something about the power of desire. So much of what we achieve or become
in this life and thus in the next, relates directly to the longings and desires of our hearts. Desire
denotes a yearning or craving. Desire is of critical importance because desire and action are
inseparably connected in a cause and effect relationship and thus, in process of time, our desires
will make us what we are. Alma was personally aware of the inexorable consequences of desire.
He said: <i>&#8220;</i>[God]<i> granteth unto men according to their desires, whether it be unto death or unto
life; . . . according to their wills whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. Yea, . . . he
that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires </i>(Alma 29:45). Elder Bruce
C. Hafen has formulated the same thought in this way: <i>&#8220;Not only will the righteous desires of
our hearts be granted, but also the unrighteous desires of our hearts. Over the long run, our
most deeply held desires will govern our choices, one by one and day by day, until our lives
finally add up to what we have really wanted&#8221; </i>(<i>The Believing Heart</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft,
1986], p. 26).</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Because our desires play such a significant role in determining our eternal destiny, educating and
training our desires is a key to personal spiritual growth. With God&#8217;s plan for us firmly in mind
and with honest commitment to our sacred covenants, we can choose to exercise our agency in
countless small ways that will help our desires to become more worthy and eventually even holy.
Unlike Alma&#8217;s case, our own mighty change and the attendant transformation of our desires will
likely come about mighty slowly. This process is described by Elder Neal A. Maxwell: 
		<i>&#8220;Each
assertion of a righteous desire, each act of service, and each act of worship, however small and
incremental, adds to our spiritual momentum. Like Newton&#8217;s Second Law, there is a transmitting
of acceleration as well as a contagiousness associated with even the small acts of goodness&#8221;
		</i>(Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign</i>, Nov. 1996, p. 21). Even
the Savior&#8217;s spiritual growth appears to have taken place gradually, over time. It was revealed to
Joseph Smith that <i>&#8220;. . . </i>[Our Savior] <i>received not of the fullness at first, but continued from
grace to grace, until he received a fullness; and thus he was called the Son of God, because he
received not of the fullness at first&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 93:13-14). 
		</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As with our Savior, so it can be with us. I often see concrete evidence of this ongoing process of
improvement in the lives of others, especially faithful Latter-day Saints who are in what we call
their &#8220;golden years.&#8221; There is a wholesomeness, a refinement, a charity about such followers of
Christ that is inspiring. I think an important part of achieving such spiritual growth is to take
time in our busy lives to continually assess the worthiness of our desires. Paul suggests this
might be done during our participation in the sacrament service. <i>&#8220;But let a man examine
himself,&#8221; </i>Paul says, <i>&#8220;and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup&#8221; 
		</i>(1 Corinthians
11:28). A lifetime of regularly examining ourselves (especially our desires) and of reviewing our
commitment to be true disciples of Christ will inevitably result in us exercising our agency in
ways that will result in the desires of our hearts becoming more righteous. Our goal is to
continually improve until eventually we come more perfectly to desire what God desires, which
is the ultimate step in becoming more like Him. Meanwhile, as recently as this past week when
the current issues of <i>Western Horseman </i>and the <i>Ensign </i>magazine arrived in the mail at our
house on the same day, I found myself, during my brief period of bedtime reading, making one
of those innumerable small choices that will shape my eventual character. I will leave it to you to
speculate about the resolution of my dilemma! </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Examining the scriptural setting of Alma&#8217;s &#8220;longing to be there&#8221; statement may also be helpful
in educating our own desires, for as someone once said, &#8220;a text without a context is a pretext.&#8221;
To begin, I wish to point out that Alma chapter 36 is a striking example of the Hebrew literary
form known as chiasmus. Chiasmus is a form of parallelism in which patterns of words, thoughts
or concepts lead to a central point of emphasis and then repeat in inverse order. This form of
writing creates interest, facilitates learning, and helps establish a priority of one concept over
another. A simple way to visualize the chiasm contained in Alma 36 is to think of the Greek
letter &#967; (chi), the 22<sup>nd</sup> letter in the Greek alphabet. Resembling our English letter &#8220;x,&#8221; chi is the
etymological source of the word chiasmus.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The first half of Alma chapter 36&#8212;the portion in which Alma recounts the visit of the angel and
Alma&#8217;s resulting pain because of his sinful past&#8212;is prelude for Alma&#8217;s explanation to Helaman
that in the midst of this very painful experience he, Alma,<i> &#8220;remembered also to have heard my
father prophesy until the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a son of God, to
atone for the sins of the world&#8221; </i>(Alma 36:17).</span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Alma&#8217;s recollection of his father&#8217;s teaching concerning the Atonement is the spiritual highlight
of chapter 36. It is also the doctrinal focal point of the chiasm. Figuratively speaking, it is where
the two lines forming the &#8220;x&#8221; or chi intersect.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The last half of chapter 36, the verses following the central point of emphasis on the Atonement,
is filled with Alma&#8217;s exultation or rejoicing because through the Atonement his sins were
forgiven and he is <i>&#8220;harrowed up by the memory of</i> [his] <i>sins no more&#8221;</i> (Alma 36:19).</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It&#8217;s also the later half of chapter 36, specifically verse 22, that contains the vision of God sitting
on his throne in heaven and Alma&#8217;s memorable statement of this education week&#8217;s theme that his
&#8220;soul longed to be there.&#8221; It is very interesting to me that verse 22 has such a positive tone and is
full of great anticipation on Alma&#8217;s part in desiring to be with God. On the other hand, verses
14-15, the counterparts to verse 22 in the parallel chiasmatic structure, provide the antithesis. In
these verses which appear in the text before Alma tells of remembering his father&#8217;s teaching of
the Atonement, Alma is full of regret and shame. Rather than longing to be with God, the
		<i>&#8220;very
thought of coming into the presence of God did rack </i>[his soul] <i>with inexpressible horror&#8221; 
		</i>(Alma
36:14).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Contrasting these verses removes all questions about the benefits and blessings of the
Atonement. Having remembered his father&#8217;s teaching of one Jesus Christ, Alma went from a
state of existential despair desiring to be extinct both soul and body rather than face God, to the
affirmation that his soul longed to be with God. This transformation of Alma&#8217;s desires could not
have taken place without the divine help that can come to each of us through the Atonement.
Continually drawing on its power and fully appreciating its cost are the factors I feel can
influence and change the desires of our hearts most effectively. I think Alma&#8217;s experience
teaches us that the Atonement is much more than a powerful concept at the center of a chiasm,
but rather that it must be the central anchor and motivating influence of our lives.

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I want to pause at this point to share a lesson Elder Dallin H. Oaks once taught. He had written a
talk for a special occasion and, as the Brethren usually do, before giving it he shared a draft of
the talk with two or three Members of the Twelve, inviting their comments and suggestions. The
drafts were returned and at the top of the first page of one of them the reviewer had made his
only comment. It was in the form of a question: <i>&#8220;Therefore, what?&#8221;</i></span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Clearly the point of this anecdote is that good teaching should result in beneficial changes in the
lives of the students or listeners. One can teach to inform (this is the information age), or to
entertain (a spoonful of sugar certainly helps the medicine go down), but the highest form of
teaching, and I might add the most difficult, is to motivate students to apply the lesson taught in
their lives.</span><br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Following Elder Oak&#8217;s counsel, I have prayerfully considered what should happen in your lives
and mine as a result of being together today. What I hope would occur is that over our lifetimes,
we will care much more about the things of God than the things of the world. If we do, we will
exercise our agency accordingly and our hearts will quite naturally come over time to desire
what God desires. When we arrive at that blessed state, our souls as did Alma&#8217;s will 
		<i>&#8220;long to be
there.&#8221; </i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I observed the end results of walking this very desirable path about 13 years ago while I was
serving as a mission president in Rochester, New York. One day I interviewed an 84-year-old
senior missionary to renew his temple recommend. He was a devoted, Church member and an
exceptional husband and patriarch of a fine family. He was on his fifth full-time mission. I
dutifully went through the prescribed temple recommend questions with him and when I reach
the next to the last one, I felt almost apologetic as I asked, &#8220;Have there been any sins or
misdeeds in your life that should have been resolved with priesthood authorities but have not
been?&#8221; He looked at me with the clearest and most honest of eyes and said, &#8220;Oh, Brother Jensen,
certainly not. At my age, I&#8217;m going for the finals, you know!&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Really at any age, we are all &#8220;going for the finals.&#8221; When that day ultimately comes&#8212;if we have
schooled our desires, we will not, as Alma suggested, fear to <i>&#8220;look up to our God 
		</i>[or] <i>. . . be
glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his
presence&#8221;</i> (Alma 12:14). Rather, we will experience supreme joy because, in Moroni&#8217;s words,<i>
&#8220;we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is&#8221;</i> and, as Moroni prayed,
		<i>&#8220;that we may have
this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure&#8221; </i>(Moroni 7:48) is also my prayer, in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></font></p>

other wedding gifts. To my complete surprise my gift was a state of the art fishing pole,
complete with lures, reel, and all the tackle equipment a novice would need to get started
into a lifetime of fishing the local lakes and streams. As someone who had never even
looked at a fishing pole, let alone held one in my hands I hardly knew what to say, but as

out of the way fishing holes. The fishing pole even went on our honeymoon. Now I know
all the men in the audience are hoping my next sentence will be that over the forty plus
years we have been married, Cal has been able to look down many a beautiful trout
stream and see his beloved wife casting and reeling in gorgeous rainbow trout with
expertise and artistry. But unfortunately, this tale has a different take.

water is mesmerizing. In the first few days of our marriage as Cal and I sat and listened
to the water running and the birds&#8217; melodies, we shared our dreams of the future. We
imagined and hoped. We knelt in a lovely verdant green forest and thanked our Heavenly

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My husband and I had the great blessing of working with over 350 missionaries in
Portugal. As the missionaries came to know the Savior&#8217;s Atonement was for them, when
they knew the Savior&#8217;s gift to them was a remission of their sins and eternal life after all
they could do, (see 2 Nephi 25:23) there was a complete change in each of those young
elders and sisters. They were anxious and even joyful most days to arise early and work
long hours. They were able to face rejection. It was a privilege, an honor to wear the

says in Mosiah 3:19, they became as little children, obedient to God and more loving.
These changes qualified them to enjoy the gifts which come through the Holy Ghost.
They came to love those they served better. And as they continued to serve Him, they
came to love Him even more. Peace was a blessing that we saw come into the lives of
these <i>&#8220;peaceable followers of Christ,&#8221;</i> our dear missionaries (see Moroni 7:3).

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Peace is centered in the Lord Jesus Christ. Peace is knowing that God lives and loves us
and that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. Our understanding of the plan of
happiness and of the role of the Atonement enables us to see somewhat beyond the
boundaries and limitations of this life. And when we are confronted with challenges, a
loving Savior grants unto us a peace that extends beyond this mortality and into eternity.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some years ago our young family lived in a South American country that was struggling
with political insecurity. Our five young children attended a school surrounded by barbed
wire and policed by guards. My husband was out of the country often and we carried on
without his physical protection and nurturing. We came to feel the Lord&#8217;s love and
protection in the absence of our husband and father in sweet ways. We felt peace in our
home, possibly because we thought often about the dedication of that home by Cal. He
prayed that as a family we would be able to feel the peace and love of the Savior within
the walls of our home as we tried to follow the promptings of the Holy Spirit.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Sometimes our neighbors and friends were fearful. I can&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t at times feel the
same, but as we gathered in prayer, we felt the reality of the words of the Savior:

I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid&#8221;</i> (John 14:27).</span><br />

loves us enough to speak to us. How important to know that we need to pray with all the

our ways as we carry a prayer in our hearts throughout each day.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In a movie portrayal about C.S. Lewis, his character made a wonderful statement about
praying. He said, <i>&#8220;I pray because I can&#8217;t help myself. I pray because I&#8217;m helpless. I pray
because the need flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn&#8217;t change

under Helaman&#8217;s direction and helped the Nephites in their critical battles against the
Lamanites. Because of their remarkable faith and ability, these young men were

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My husband and I had the great blessing of reading the Book of Mormon together the
first month of our mission in Portugal. We had started at home in SLC with the specific
purpose of allowing the Lord to teach us through his words what he would have us do
with not only our missionaries but also the members and members to be. Those first few
weeks in the mission were discouraging. Our Portuguese was woefully lacking, our
spirits were sagging and we felt inadequate in every way. We had so many questions &#8211;
from how to drive to our 29 units of the church on roads built before the time of Christ,
to how to best teach the gospel to so many anxious learners. But as we read Moroni&#8217;s
promise that <i>&#8220;by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things,&#8221; 
		</i>we
felt a peace and confirmation that the Lord knew of our weaknesses. We knew if we put
our trust in Him completely, he would qualify us, he would help us do His work.

powerful spirits and the great faith of the people. They had so little temporally, but they
were rich spiritually. The children carried their scriptures lovingly. Their well-worn,

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The scriptures tell us

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Among the many admirable traits Nephi possessed, one of my favorites is his initiative.
Once the Lord gave him a commandment, Nephi went into action and continued to act
even when unexpected problems hedged the way. Unlike Nephi&#8217;s older brothers who
didn&#8217;t harken to the Lord even when rebuked by an angel Nephi never wavered.</span></font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Lord&#8217;s plan for us has always been a plan of happiness. Choosing to be happy brings
peace and increases our ability to follow the Lord&#8217;s plan of happiness. One of our
daughters as she entered her teens was struggling to find her own testimony of the gospel.
In her search to find answers she started looking at people she admired that were happy.
Interestingly she discovered that her happiest friends and neighbors were the ones trying
to live the gospel and keep the commandments. She started to change. It did not happen
overnight, but she began to see many things she knew she should be happy about and her
gratitude and love for the gospel increased.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we want our own children to understand and experience the happiness of the gospel of
Jesus Christ they will need to see their parents happy as they try to live it. How can they
know that peace come from righteousness, when the world would teach just the opposite
without an example of happy parents.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is easy to say we should all be happy, but how do we do it? Happiness is an attitude, a
desire. To want to be happy is mandatory before one can ever be happy or at peace. We
will want to take time to be still and hear the quiet whisperings of the Holy Ghost. I
remember those first few days of marriage on the banks of a river leisurely talking about
how we hoped to have a righteous family together. We, without planning to do so, bore
our testimonies to each other. We counted our blessings. We committed to keep all the
covenants we had made at baptism and in the temple. We weren&#8217;t in a hurry and the
sweetness of those moments are wonderful to look back on in stressful times. Cal will
even admit that the disappointment of his wife not becoming a fisherwoman has been
replaced with the good times we have had together looking at, standing by and walking
through many rivers throughout the world.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Happiness comes in loosing yourself in the service of others. You have heard the story of
President Hinckley and his mission to England when he became so discouraged and
homesick. He wrote a letter to his father, Briant Hinckley, saying he wanted to come
home and not waste his father&#8217;s money any longer. His father wrote a brief note
admonishing young Elder Hinckley to forget himself and get to work serving others. Acts
of service relieve the burdens of those who are serving. We have all felt the peace that
comes, often unexpectedly, as we forget our self and help someone else. </span>
<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we are not happy maybe the solution is to let the Lord&#8217;s plan work more fully in our
lives. We need to allow the light of the gospel to lift us and calm our spirits and bring us
peace.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Have you ever tried to follow a single drop of water in a river as it bounces over rocks
and falls down steep ravines? At times I have wondered how many droplets it takes to
make up the rushing river. Each drop of water moves down the river bed never to return.
The water in a river is being supplied by its source and then it runs its course to another
body of water, never to return to its original path. But it does take with it that which it
flows over, mud, rocks, sticks and more.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">So it is with us. Today is the only day we have to go and do and become a better disciple
of the Savior. We can not live our yesterdays over and our tomorrows are yet to come.
Now I&#8217;m not saying we should eat, drink and be merry today because tomorrow may
never come, but rather like a drop of water make the most of your journey each and every
day. You can&#8217;t return to the opportunities of yesterday, but you can learn from them. You
will take some of that which you &#8220;pass over&#8221;.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">All the pieces of mud, rocks, and sticks collectively can change the course of rivers. The
great deltas of the world have pushed back the mighty oceans and increased land masses.
Just so a little experience here and there, in our quest to go and do what the Lord would
have us do, can have a large effect on many. You never know when a small kindness here
or the sharing of your testimony there, can change a person or even numbers of peoples
lives.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In 1974 when our family moved to South America we were supposed to go directly to
Argentina, but our government thought we would do better with our large, young family
in Brazil where it was more politically secure. We eventually were blessed to move to
Argentina as it became more stable. This was initially Cal&#8217;s hope as he had served a
mission there as a young man. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Years and years later we saw there was a greater plan for the Clegg&#8217;s. In Brazil we
learned to speak Portuguese. We learned about a new and developing church. All of these
experiences and more were brought to the mission field in 1996 when we were called to
serve as Mission President and wife. Our unexpected stop in Brazil for two years was a
disappointment at first, but provided some invaluable experiences and lasting friendships.

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If you have a detour or two that are not in your plan, it just might be in someone else&#8217;s
plan to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of men, which is God&#8217;s purpose.
How great will be your peace when you see God can make a palace out of the little
cottage you thought you were building (see writings of C.S. Lewis).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know the Savior wants us to come unto Him and find His rest. I know I can pray to him
anytime and any place and He will give answers to my prayers. As we learn of Him, as
we listen to His words and as we seek to offer our <i>&#8220;whole souls&#8221; 
		</i>to Him (see Omni 1:26)
and keep His commandments we will become more like him (see Moroni 7:48). Great
will be our peace like a river running continually if supplied by its true source. His peace
can be ours in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></font></p>

symptoms:</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the temple president noticed a sister of very modest means who was in the
temple almost daily. He asked the sister how she could afford to come to the temple so often. She
replied that she had her little pension and if she were very careful she could pay for the three bus
rides it took for her to travel from her home to the temple and then back. Then she brightened up and
said, &#8220;But if someone gives me a ride to the temple and back, I can even afford bread to go with my
beans.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Well, for today would you please consider the actual vehicle of this symbolic fever to be simply the
title &#8220;Our God (the Father and the Son &#8211; used quasi interchangeably), the Prophets of God (past and

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ live. I know their form and that they love each
of us individually more than we can comprehend. Prophets receive intelligence and guidance from
Deity. Temples represent in a most positive physical presence the spiritual love of the Father and His

God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">With the callings of Moses, Enoch, and Joseph Smith, do we see a pattern of those called, each
possessing willing, humble, Spirits? Joseph Smith, the beloved first prophet of this dispensation
enjoyed a close relationship with the Lord and His messengers. We recall Peter Whitmer felt to invite
the Prophet Joseph and Emma to move from New York to his Hiram, Ohio, home to alleviate some
of the negative pressure of the prophet&#8217;s opposition. Peter asked his son David to go to New York
and invite the Prophet Joseph to move to Ohio. David indicated he would be pleased to do so, but he
had some farm work that had to be completed before he could leave. David went about his work and
was amazed he was able to complete three days work in just one day. Then he went to spread some
&#8220;plaster&#8221; on property adjacent to where his sister lived. Upon his arrival he found the plaster had
been spread from its pile over the land. David inquired of his sister as to whom had provided all the
labor to complete the project. She said she didn&#8217;t know who the three men were that had done the
work, but that they were <span style="text-decoration: underline">amazingly</span> efficient and 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">fast</span> workers. </span>
<br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In going to Ohio the prophet was very anxious about the safety of transporting the plates because of
those who wanted to steal them. So it was arranged for an angelic messenger to receive the plates
from the prophet in New York. The messenger then delivered the plates later to the prophet after his
successful travel to Ohio by the side of Peter Whitmer&#8217;s home in Ohio.

went about blessing and raising the sick from their beds of affliction.

went to bless a brother, Elijah Fordham:</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">who was supposed to be about breathing his last. When the company entered the room, the Prophet of
God walked up to the dying man, and took hold of his right hand and spoke to him; but Brother
Fordham was unable to speak, his eyes were set in his head like glass, and he seemed entirely
unconscious of all around him. Joseph held his hand and looked into his eyes in silence for a length
of time. A change in the countenance of Brother Fordham was soon perceptible to all present. His
sight returned, and upon Joseph asking him if he knew him, he, in a slow whisper, answered, &#8220;I fear
it is too late; if you had come sooner I think I could have been healed.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you
believe in Jesus Christ?&#8221; He answered in a feeble voice, &#8220;I do.&#8221; Joseph then stood erect, still holding
his hand in silence several moments, then he spake in a very loud voice, saying, &#8220;Brother Fordham, I
command you in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from this bed and be made whole.&#8221; His voice was
like the voice of God, and not of man. It seemed as though the house shook to its very foundation.
Brother Fordham arose from his bed and was immediately made whole (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Life of Joseph Smith the

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The temple is literally the House of the Lord. Again, the Lord has 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">always </span>commanded his people to
build temples, holy buildings in which worthy Saints perform sacred ceremonies and ordinances of
the gospel for themselves and in later times for the dead.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In this dispensation, Joseph Smith had baptisms for the dead performed, but endowments for the dead
were not performed until 1877.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Lord visits His temples, and they are the most holy of all places in which to worship.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Throughout religious history, the Lord has placed an urgency upon the creation and utilization of
temples (Perhaps as a symbolic fever?).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The earliest temple we learn of was when the Lord instructed Moses to prepare a portable temple
according to His pattern which was referred to as a tabernacle. This was used as Moses and his
people traveled about the desert.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The first permanent temple built was the temple of Solomon. King David wanted to build it, but was
not permitted to do so (His fever was denied). Solomon&#8217;s Temple was destroyed in 600 B.C. by the
Babylonians and was restored by Zerubbabel almost a hundred years later. This restoration of
Soloman&#8217;s Temple came about after the Prophet Haggai was entreated by the Lord to tell the people,
in effect, to &#8220;get on the ball&#8221; and build my temple. How can you remain so comfortable in your own
homes when you have not provided for My Home? (Catch the potential of temple fever!).</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After this restoration, part of this temple was burned in 37 B.C., and Herod, the Great, later rebuilt it.
This was the temple in use at the time of Jesus&#8217; ministry.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the Book of Mormon, the righteous followers of God were led to build and worship in temples
(see 2 Nephi 5:16).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Building and using a temple properly are signs of the true church in any dispensation. Have we ever
wondered why other churches are not concerned about temples, even as there are many references
about them in the Bible?</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After encouragement by the Lord, Joseph Smith was required to begin construction of the first temple
of this dispensation in Kirtland, Ohio. This was in 1833, just three years following the organization
of the Church.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How would we react to a call by the Lord if asked to have a Singles ward build a temple? In Kirtland
at that time, the number of members present, and their in-pocket funds was probably quite similar to
a BYU&#8211;Idaho Singles Ward.</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In Kirtland, each of the Brethren was asked to spend one day per week working on the temple. There
were also those who spent their full time working on the temple and received only food and home
spun clothing in return. As always, the sisters provided more than a fair share of support. Not only
did they prepare food and make clothing for the workers, but they drove the animals transporting the
granite, worked in the quarry, and at the temple alongside the men, made carpets and curtains, and
crushed their china to add sparkle to the exterior of the temple.</span><br />

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In 1951, there were eight temples in the church. Today there are 122 temples functioning, with the
123rd to be dedicated in September. This tremendous growth has occurred by the will of the Lord,
through the inspiration and leadership of President Gordon B. Hinckley.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley holds &#8220;temples&#8221; very close to himself.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">May I share a personal experience, because I believe it may help us understand the particular
relationship that exists between Our Lord, President Hinckley, and temples.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we were called to serve as a Mission President, President N. Eldon Tanner issued the call on
the telephone and then he said, &#8220;Now, you can go home and tell your wife, but you can&#8217;t tell anyone
else until or unless you receive a letter confirming this calling.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we were called to serve as a member of the Seventy, President Hinckley said, over the phone,
and after a few simple pleasantries, &#8220;We feel to call you to serve in the Second Quorum of the
Seventy. The calling will be for five years and you will be assigned to serve outside of the United
States. Others will call and furnish more details. Goodbye.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">However, the calling to serve as Temple President came about much differently. While working in
my office in the Church Administration Building, President Hinckley&#8217;s personal secretary asked me
to come down to President Hinckley&#8217;s office.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley made me comfortable, then indicated the time for my release from the Quorum of
the Seventy had arrived. This I had totally anticipated. But, then he asked if we felt willing to provide
a few more years of extended service in some capacity. He looked at me and asked, &#8220;How would you
feel about serving as President of a Temple?&#8221; Then he named a temple that is located in the Midwest.
I enthusiastically indicated that would be just fine. The he paused, and his look seemingly moved
above my head as he pondered, and he said, &#8220;No, that isn&#8217;t quite right. His gaze momentarily
returned to my homely face, and he said, &#8220;Oakland, how would you feel about serving as the
President of the California, Oakland Temple?&#8221;</span><br /></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There was an immediate confirmatory spirit that the call was just right. I will never know what
transpired in the understanding of President Hinckley at that moment, but I do know it was
appropriate in his mind and with the Lord.

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Early in Jesuss ministry, 
		John records in John 4:4 that Jesus must needs go through Samaria on 
		His way from Judea to Galilee. The need that John refers to was not 
		geographical. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Since the context suggests 
		that He was probably already in the Jordan valley, Jesus could have 
		easily avoided Samaria by going through the Bethshan gap into Galilee. 
		But He had work to do in Samaria, so He traveled instead to Sychar, 
		near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and near 
		to Jacobs Well (John 4:56). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The events described in John 
		4 are interesting to me for three main reasons. First, when Jesus gave 
		His commission to his Twelve apostles in Matthew 10, He specifically 
		instructed them <i>not</i> to engage [page 2] in missionary work among 
		the Samaritans. Yet, in this instance, He seems to have gone out of his 
		way to travel through Samaria and to seek out the Samaritan woman.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Second, Jesuss teachings in 
		John 4 are an important example of one of the significant themes that 
		runs throughout Johns gospel: that Jesus, who comes from above and sees 
		things from a heavenly perspective must interact with people who are 
		limited to a very earthly perspective. In his conversations with his 
		mother, Mary, Nicodemus, and the Pharisees, we see him working to help 
		them see as he sees; to gain an eternal perspective of who He is and 
		what He came to earth to accomplish. Although much of chapter 4 deals 
		with the Saviors interaction with the Samaritan woman, His 
		conversations with his own disciples and the Samaritan men of the city 
		are also focused on helping them to raise their sights so that they can 
		understand more clearly who He is and what his mission entails, without 
		the limitations of religious and political assumptions, which underlie 
		this story.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Third, the account of Jesuss 
		interaction with the Samaritan woman shows a good knowledge of Samaritan 
		beliefs and practices and of Judeo-Samaritan relations. Let me take a 
		few minutes to discuss some of these issues because they are critical to 
		our understanding of the text of John 4. We must first be clear about 
		who the Samaritans were. Sometimes in our discussions we have not been 
		careful enough to distinguish between Samarians, the people who lived in 
		the geo-political region of Samaria, and the Samaritans. Not every one 
		who lived in Samaria was a Samaritan. This is important because in our 
		present King James Version of the Old Testament, we only find the name 
		Samaritan used once. It is found in 2 Kings 17:29. Here Samaritan is a 
		translation of the Hebrew word <i><span style="font-family: Rosetta">
		hasûsûomeïroniîm</span></i>. The context of the verse is a description 
		of the scene after the deportation of the northern tribes and the 
		introduction of [page 3] Assyrian colonists. The text tells how these 
		colonists merged elements of their religious practices with those of the 
		Israelite religion. The question here is how we should translate the 
		word <i><span style="font-family: Rosetta">hasûsûomeïroniîm</span></i>; 
		should it be Samaritan or Samarian? I think that it is more accurate to 
		translate it as Samarian because there is no evidence of Assyrian 
		religious influence in the Samaritan religion and because we dont find 
		any concrete evidence for a separate and distinct Samaritan religion 
		until a much later period of time, during the Hasmonean Period, 16763 
		BC. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To be sure, prior to the 
		split there was a long history of tension between the northern and 
		southern Israelite tribes that can be traced to pre-Monarchical times. 
		At times, such as during the time of Ezra, that tension became intense. 
		Even so, we have evidence from Jeremiah 41 and 2 Chronicles 34 that 
		people from Samaria continued to make contributions to the temple in 
		Jerusalem and to participate in its sacrifices. In fact, Josephus 
		records that they continued to come to the Jerusalem temple down into 
		the Roman period.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But during the Hasmonean 
		period two major events suggest that the split with Judaism became 
		substantial. First, it is during this time that we see the first 
		evidence of a distinct Samaritan scriptural canon. Although the 
		formation of the Jewish canon was still in flux during this time, we can 
		still note some points where the Samaritans were creating a canon that 
		separated them from the Jewish counterpart. For example, the Dead Sea 
		Scrolls confirm that the forms of spelling and the type of script used 
		to write the Samaritan scriptures are consistent with a date during the 
		Hasmonean Period. The script is a form of Hebrew script known as paleo-Hebrew, 
		or old-Hebrew. During the Persian period, around the time of Ezra, the 
		square Aramaic script was adopted and widely used. This is similar to 
		the Hebrew script with which we are familiar today.<span style="font-size: 20.0pt">
</span>In this slide, we can see the Aramaic script in the far left 
		column and then variations of the paleo-Hebrew script in the remaining 
		columns. The type of paleo-Hebrew used [page 4] in the Samaritan 
		scriptures is the type found in use during the Hasmonean Period. Why did 
		the Samaritans begin using the paleo-Hebrew script? It was probably 
		motivated by the desire to make the point that they were the descendants 
		of true Israel. It was a means of identifying themselves vis-à-vis 
		their Jewish opponents.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition, the Samaritans 
		also distinguished themselves by what they included in their scriptural 
		canon. Unlike the Jews they restricted their canon to the five books of 
		Mosesthe Pentateuch. They thus rejected the prophetic tradition of the 
		Hebrew Old Testament. Even within their Pentateuch there are some 
		significant differences with the Hebrew version with which we are 
		familiar today. Let me give one quick example. Deuteronomy 27:48 
		describes the command to the people of Israel that when they cross over 
		the Jordan River they were to build an altar upon which they would offer 
		sacrifices to the Lord their God. In the Hebrew Bible they were directed 
		to build the altar on Mount Ebal. In the Samaritan Pentateuch, however, 
		the site for the altar is Mount Gerizim. This different reading reflects 
		on one of the central differences between the Samaritans and the Jews. 
		For the Samaritans, Mount Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the holy site, the 
		revealed site for the temple, which they built during Greek period. This 
		reading of Deuteronomy 27 is so important to Samaritan theology that it 
		was incorporated as the final commandment in their version of Mosess 
		Ten Commandments. These readings suggest that the formation of the 
		Samaritan canon was motivated, at least in part, to be used as an 
		ideological weapon against their Jewish opponents.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The second event that 
		suggests the rise of the Samaritan religion during the Hasmonean Period 
		is their response to the Jewish Maccabean Revolt. This was a time of 
		tremendous political and religious turmoil for both Samaria and Judea. 
		Under the political control of the Greek [page 5] Seleucid, Antiochus 
		Ephiphanes IV, both regions experienced intense religious oppression. 
		Significantly, however, when the Hasmoneans rose up in rebellion against 
		the Seleucids, the Samaritans did not join with them in the fight for 
		freedom. Even though they would clearly have benefited by removing the 
		Seleucids from power over them, they apparently did not believe they 
		would experience any more religious freedom under the Hasmoneans. This 
		would suggest that, by this time, both they and the Hasmoneans 
		characterized the Samaritans as a religion that was distinct from 
		Judaism. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This assessment was later 
		confirmed when one of the Hasmonean leaders, John Hyrcanus (134104 BC), 
		treated the Samaritans as Gentiles. In a military campaign in which he 
		attacked cities in Syria, he also attacked Samaria and Shechem, and he 
		destroyed the temple on Mount Gerizim. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal">
<font color="#000080">One scholar has suggested that Hyrcanuss action 
		against Mount Gerizim, in particular, may have been motivated by the 
		fact that the Samaritans could trace their High Priestly lineage, to the 
		legitimate Zadokite line. This lineage was in contrast to the Hasmoneans, 
		who belonged to a priestly family, but who had usurped the high priestly 
		duties by political appointment from the Seleucids in 152 BC. Therefore, 
		the issue became more than simply a question of where the temple should 
		be located; it also became an issue of who had a legitimate claim to the 
		high priestly office. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By the time Jesus conversed 
		with the Samaritans at Jacobs Well, these events were firmly entrenched 
		in the religious psyche of both the Samaritans and the Jews. By 
		understanding them, we are now in a better position to appreciate how 
		the Master Teacher was able to invite [page 6] Samaritans to raise their 
		sights above their political and religious antipathies for the Jews and 
		recognize in Jesus the Christ, the Saviour of the world (John 4:42).</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-top: 12.0pt">
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: normal">Shortly after 
		arriving at Jacobs Well the disciples left Jesus so that they could go 
		and buy food in the city. While he was resting a Samaritan woman came to 
		draw water from the well. As soon as Jesus asked her for a drink, she 
		recognized Him as a Jew. Her response in verse 9 acknowledged the 
		deep-seated feelings of hostility between the two groups. How is it 
		that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? 
		For the Jews do not have friendly relations [</span><i><span style="font-family: Rosetta; font-weight: normal">sunchrontai</span></i><span style="font-weight: normal">] 
		with the Samaritans. The womans statement shows that all she saw in 
		Jesus was an enemy. In contrast to her limited vision, Jesuss request 
		showed that he crossed the boundaries between Jews and Samaritans. He 
		saw in the woman something much more than a Samaritan. So He helped her 
		elevate her sights. To do so, He used the very earthly, daily task of 
		drawing water. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When the Samaritan woman came 
		to the well, her mindset was focused on the grind of her daily chore. 
		According to verse 15, this was a chore that she clearly wished she 
		could forgo. But the Master Teacher used that chore to teach the woman 
		about the things of eternity. While she was fixated on the physical 
		water and the difficulty of obtaining it without a bucket, He reminded 
		her in verse 14, of the living water that would be a spring of [page 7] 
		water bubbling up into eternal life. Later, in John 7:37, Jesus 
		specifically declared, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and 
		drink. <i>This</i> was the gift of God that Jesus was offering not 
		just to the Jews but also to a Samaritan woman. It was a greater gift 
		than the well Jacob dug that had supplied water for millennia because 
		the water Jesus offered would last for eternity. It was a gift that came 
		freely from God without the laborious effort required for drawing water 
		from a well that was a hundred feet deep!</font><span style="color: #000080">
</span><font color="#000080">But to receive the gift, the Samaritan 
		woman had to come to recognize who Jesus was; to recognize that He was 
		much more than a Jew and that He was not an enemy of her people.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Only after Jesus had gained 
		the womans attention with the hope of living water did He move to help 
		her raise her sights. To do so, He had to accomplish two things. First, 
		He had to bring her to a point where she felt a sense of sin and could 
		therefore recognize her need for help. Second, He had to establish His 
		authority as Gods representative on earth. He accomplished both in a 
		masterful teaching moment. By instructing her to call her husband, He 
		simultaneously raised a mirror of spiritual introspection and opened the 
		door for her to see Him from a higher spiritual perspective. He revealed 
		to her that even though they had just met, He knew who she was: more 
		than the fact that she was a Samaritan, she was a woman who had had five 
		husbands but who was now living with a man who was not her husband. <b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoHeader"><font color="#000080">[page 8] This revelation 
		clearly impacted the woman. Later, in verse 29, she told the men in her 
		village that Jesus told me all things that ever I did. In light of the 
		details recorded in John, this statement appears to be a hyperbole, but 
		it illustrates how profound the revelation of her life was to the woman. 
		She now saw this man at the well in a different light. She knew that 
		Jesus was much more than a Jew and so declares in verse 19: Lord (<i>kurios</i>), 
		I perceive that you are a prophet. This was a significant realization 
		for her. The Samaritans, as we noted, did not accept the prophetic books 
		of the Old Testament; but they did anticipate the coming of a prophet, 
		an expectation that was based on Deuteronomy 18:1518. This prophecy 
		indicates that the Lord will raise up a prophet like unto Moses. . . . 
		I will put my words in [the prophets] mouth; and he shall speak . . . 
		all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever 
		will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will 
		require it of him (Deuteronomy 18:1819). Then, Moses declares in 
		verses 2022 that if the prophet is not sent from God, his prophecies 
		will not come true, and therefore the people should not be afraid of 
		him. Because Jesuss revelations were true, the woman was obligated to 
		acknowledge Jesus as a prophet and recognize that what He said came from 
		God. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoHeader"><font color="#000080">With this realization, 
		however, the woman was clearly faced with an internal quandary. On the 
		one hand, she recognized Jesus as a prophet; but, on the other, in verse 
		20, she was torn by the reality that &nbsp;Our fathers worshipped in this 
		mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to 
		worship. Two items are important about this statement. First is her 
		comment that Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. This mountain 
		is a clear [page 9] reference to Mount Gerizim that provided the 
		topographical background for their conversation. Worship on this 
		mountain was and continues to be <i>the</i> theological difference that 
		separates the Samaritans and the Jews. Second, the past tense of the 
		verb (<i>aorist</i>), showing that her ancestors worshiped on Mount 
		Gerizim, reflects the historical reality that their temple had been 
		destroyed by John Hyrcanus more than a hundred years before. Although 
		the Samaritans never rebuilt their temple, through the intervening 
		centuries, they have always recognized the sanctity of Mount Gerizim and 
		have continued to offer sacrifices on it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoHeader"><font color="#000080">Jesuss response to the 
		question of where to worship was again calculated to move the Samaritan 
		womans perspective to an even higher level. In verse 21 he declares, 
		Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this 
		mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. The physical temple 
		on Mount Gerizim had been destroyed. The physical temple in Jerusalem 
		would also be destroyed in the near future. The purpose of temples has 
		always been to provide a way for individuals to ritually leave behind 
		the things of the world and enter the presence of God. The Samaritan 
		woman was so consumed by the Jewish/Samaritan debate over the correct 
		location for the temple that she had not realized that Jesus was the 
		ultimate way to enter the presence of the Father. He was the Word who 
		enabled humans to come to know the Father while they were still in 
		mortality. As Elder Holland taught, It is the grand truth that in all 
		that Jesus came to say and do, including and especially in His atoning 
		suffering and sacrifice, He was showing us who and what God our [page 
		10] Eternal Father is like, how completely devoted He is to His children 
		in every age and nation. In word and deed Jesus was trying to reveal and 
		make personal to us the true nature of His Father, our Father in 
		Heaven.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At this point, the Samaritan 
		woman did not know what she worshiped. As a Samaritan, she had rejected 
		the continuous revelation of God through the Old Testament prophets; she 
		apparently did not appreciate the true purpose of the temple; and she 
		did not understand the implications of her declaration that Jesus was a 
		prophet. Jesus had taught here that salvation was of the Jews because 
		the prophet standing before her was the source of salvation and because 
		He, as she had quickly recognized at the beginning of their interaction, 
		was a Jew. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So Jesus taught her the 
		elements of true worship. It is not always a function of location, nor 
		is it a function of having a physical building in which to worship. 
		Rather, Jesus taught that what is most important is that true worshipers 
		worship [the Father] in spirit and in truth. In fact, that process is 
		an absolute requirement. Thus, Elder McConkie taught that our purpose 
		is to worship the true and living God and to do it by the power of the 
		Spirit and in the way he has ordained. The approved worship of the true 
		God leads to salvation; devotions rendered to false gods and which are 
		not founded on eternal truth carry no such assurance. According to the 
		Joseph Smith Translation of John 4:26, Jesus then taught that God would 
		send His Spirit to those who engaged in true worship. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Again, the woman was 
		confused. The only thing that the Samaritans anticipated from their 
		worship was the coming of the Taheb. In verse 25 she declares, I know 
		that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will 
		tell us all things. Although she uses the [page 11] term <i>messiah</i>, 
		we need to remember that the Samaritan hope was very different from 
		their Jewish counterparts. The Samaritans certainly did not anticipate 
		that the Messiah would be a Davidic king! Instead, their Taheb was a 
		restorer who would reinstitute the age of divine favor. Having created 
		the teaching moment, Jesus was then ready to reveal fully His identity 
		to the Samaritan woman. He is the fulfillment of this Samaritan hope; 
		just as Jesus taught the Nephites, He is the prophet like unto 
		[Moses]. But, in making that identification, he went further. He 
		applied the divine title, I AM to Himself. Literally, in verse 26 He 
		says, I Am, the one who speaks to you. Jesus was indeed the prophet 
		like unto Moses, but He was also the God who directed Moses. In both of 
		these roles, He had indeed come to tell her all things. No doubt the 
		Samaritan woman understood exactly what Jesus was saying. John tells us 
		in verse 28 that she then left her waterpot. She had come to the well 
		with her waterpot in search of water, and she left with water, but not 
		the kind she could carry in a pot. She had found the living water that 
		Jesus had promised her. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Like Lehi in his vision of 
		the tree of life, as soon as she realized what she had received, she 
		yearned to share it with others. She returned to Sychar and invited the 
		villagers to Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: 
		is not this the Christ? The inclusion of the Greek particle <i>
<span style="font-family: Rosetta">meti</span></i> at the beginning of 
		the question indicates that she did not expect a positive answer. This 
		usage is probably why she invited them to come and see for themselves 
		rather than rely on her witness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Just as the Samaritan woman 
		was leaving the well, Jesuss disciples returned with the food they had 
		bought. With the Samaritan woman before them, Jesus used the opportunity 
		to [page 12] give His earthbound disciples a glimpse into His mission 
		and into what God had prepared for the Samaritans. In verse 34 he says, 
		My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
		That work included sowing seeds among the Samaritans, which the 
		disciples would reap after Jesus had left them. The disciples reaction 
		when they saw the Savior conversing with the Samaritan woman suggests 
		that they were not immune from some of the antipathy for the Samaritans 
		that was common among the Jews, but Jesus encouraged them to Lift up 
		your eyes, and look on the fields. Perhaps He was inviting them to 
		elevate the perception of the land of Samaria. Instead of seeing it as a 
		place to be avoided, they should recognize it, as he says in verse 35, 
		as fields that were white already to harvest. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">With the Samaritan woman, 
		Jesus had sown a seed that was about to bear fruit, but the disciples 
		would also participate in a later harvest. Using the prophetic past 
		tense, Jesus said in verse 38, I sent you to reap that whereon ye 
		bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their 
		labours. After Jesuss resurrection, He modified the apostolic 
		commission He gave in Matthew 10:5 that they were not to go into any 
		city of the Samaritans. On the Mount of Olives, He would specifically 
		command them that after they had received the Holy Ghost, they were to 
		be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and <i>in 
		Samaria</i>, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts records a 
		partial fulfillment of this prophecy in the work of Philip, Peter, and 
		John in Samaria. Jesuss journey into Samaria was not just to teach the 
		Samaritan woman but also to teach his disciples and help both sides 
		overcome their prejudices. [page 13]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Jesus finished teaching 
		His disciples, we learn in verse 39 that many of the Samaritans of that 
		city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He 
		told me all that ever I did. The Samaritans were so taken with His 
		teachings that they implored Him to stay with them. He agreed, and the 
		result was that many more believed because of his own word. They each 
		received a personal testimony that was independent of the Samaritan 
		womans and therefore testified that they knew this is indeed the 
		Christ, the Saviour of the world. They had learned that Jesus was not 
		just a Jew, not just a prophet, and not just a messiah. He was the 
		Savior of the Jews, of the Samaritans, and of the world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoHeader"><font color="#000080"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoHeader"><font color="#000080">A fourth-century Christian, 
		Ephraem the Syrian, wonderfully summarized Jesuss interactions with the 
		Samaritan woman in the following way: Our Lord came to the fountain of 
		water as a hunter. . . . He cast a bait for the dove so that through it 
		he might capture the entire flock. . . . She first saw him as someone 
		thirsting; and then as a Jew; then as a prophet, and after that as God. 
		As someone thirsting, she persuaded him; as a Jew, she recoiled from 
		him, as a learned one, she interrogated him, as a prophet she was 
		reprimanded, and as the Messiah she worshipped him. Although Jesus had 
		good success among the Samaritans this time, later Luke 9 records that 
		He received a very different reaction. On that occasion, the Samaritans 
		did not have one of their own to introduce the Messiah to them. Perhaps 
		that is one reason they could not [page 14] accept that Jesus was 
		committed to Jerusalem rather than Mount Gerizim. Both of these 
		incidents remind modern readers that nationality is not what determines 
		or precludes salvation; rather, salvation comes from how individuals 
		respond to the Saviors attempts to raise their sights from an earthly 
		to a heavenly perspective and how they respond to His invitation to 
		Come, follow me.</font></p>

			Washington.&nbsp; May 18<sup>th</sup> of that year was a Sunday.&nbsp; At 
			about 10:00 that Sunday morning, my dad noticed an enormous bank of 
			very strange clouds approaching from the west.&nbsp; Soon the whole 
			family was in the front yard, taking pictures and describing to one 
			another those very unusual clouds.&nbsp; Oddly, the clouds kept moving, 
			but it didnât start raining.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt">It didnât rain because those clouds 
			were not what they appeared to be.&nbsp; A phone call from a neighbor 
			informed us that 150 miles to the west, Mount Saint Helens had 
			erupted.&nbsp; We were looking at a volcanic ash cloud.&nbsp; As those now 
			ominous clouds approached the eastern horizon, it became 
			increasingly and dramatically dark.&nbsp; Although it was not yet noon, 
			there was soon only a thin line of daylight left in the east.&nbsp; When 
			the falling ash blocked out all the light of the sun and even the 
			lights of the closest houses, a pleasant spring morning became 
			sudden, unnatural night.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">The word âlightâ occurs hundreds of 
			times in the scriptures.&nbsp; These uses range from the grand first 
			recorded words of God in the Bible, âLet there be lightâ (Genesis 
			1:3), to quiet expressions of faith: âFor thou wilt light my candle: 
			the LORD my God will enlighten my darknessâ (Psalms 18:28).&nbsp; Our 
			Father in Heaven and his Son Jesus Christ are frequently described 
			in terms of their light.&nbsp; John teaches us that âGod is light, and in 
			him is no darkness at allâ (1 John 1:5).&nbsp; The Savior describes 
			himself, saying âI am the light of the world: he that followeth me 
			shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of lifeâ (John 
			8:12).&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">Light is used in invitationsââcome ye 
			and let us walk in the light of the Lordâ (2 Nephi 12:5), and in 
			warningsââhe that repents not, from him shall be taken even the 
			light which he has receivedâ (D&amp;C 1:33).&nbsp; Light is frequently 
			synonymous with truth.&nbsp; In the Psalms we read âO send out thy light 
			and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy 
			hill, and to thy tabernaclesâ (Psalms 43:3).&nbsp; A similar verse from 
			the Psalms says âThy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto 
			my pathâ (Psalms 119:105).&nbsp; The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us 
			that âthe word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is 
			light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus 
			Christâ (D&amp;C 84:45).&nbsp; Among other things, these verses teach us that 
			to increase in light is to increase in knowledge of the truth, to 
			become increasingly filled with the Spirit, and to walk in safety by 
			drawing nearer unto and becoming more like God.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt">President Hinckley cited Doctrine and

			particular attention to the pattern it teaches.&nbsp; It is a pattern of 
			receiving light, obeying that light, and then receiving more light 
			in a potentially eternal cycle.&nbsp; Listen once more: âThat which is of 
			God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God,

<font color="#000080">The opening phrase of our verse is:<b> that

			more time on this phrase than on the others.&nbsp; By revealing 
			doctrines, principles, commandments, and covenants unto us, our 
			Father in Heaven strives to bless us with light.&nbsp; Our adversary, on 
			the other hand, strives to take light out of our lives.&nbsp; Consider 
			the warning in this verse: âAnd that wicked one cometh and taketh 
			away light and truthâ (D&amp;C 93:39).&nbsp; Satan will try to take away 
			light and truth from you by twisting your perception of Godâs 
			doctrines, principles, commandments, and covenants and by distorting 
			your response to them.&nbsp; In a recent address, Elder Bednar emphasized 
			Luciferâs distorting efforts, teaching us that he, Lucifer, 
			âdistorts the doctrines that matter most to us individually, to our 
			families, and to the world.â</font></span><span class="EndnoteRefe"><font color="#000080" size="1">2</font></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
			To the extent that you answer the following questions affirmatively,

		continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter 
		and brighter until the perfect day.â&nbsp; The following verse teaches us 
		that God gives us truth that we âmay chase darkness from among [us]â 
		(D&amp;C 50:25).&nbsp; If you are armed with light and truth, you need not be 
		afraid of the dark.&nbsp; You can chase it away.&nbsp; In contrast, there was 
		nothing we could do to make the ash cloud go away when Mount Saint 
		Helens erupted.&nbsp; Your case is different.&nbsp; Satan has sent out his own 
		âash cloud,â but you can chase that cloud away with light.&nbsp; </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">Weâve just referred to the verse that 
		follows our theme verse.&nbsp; Consider the verse that precedes it.&nbsp; â[T]hat 
		which doth not edify is not of God, and is darknessâ (D&amp;C 50:23).&nbsp; 
		Please ponder that powerful truth.&nbsp; If there is anything in your life 
		that turns out your lights, you need not wonder where it comes from.&nbsp; If 
		it does not strengthen and encourage you, it cannot be of God.&nbsp; It is 
		darkness.&nbsp; Chase it away with light.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">The adversary wants to bind you in the 
		darkness.&nbsp; A pair of verses from 2 Nephi shows us two different paths 
		that lead to that bleak end.&nbsp; The first path is anger: âFor behold, [in&nbsp; 
		our] day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir 
		them up to anger against that which is good.â&nbsp; The second path is 
		passivity: âAnd others will he pacifyâ (2 Nephi 28:20-21).</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">Now, darkness is clearly winning if light 
		angers you, but I hope that you can see that your peril is every bit as 
		great if you passively yawn and roll over as the spiritual lights go 
		out.&nbsp; Even if, in the spiritual sense, the adversary has only made you a 
		little bit drowsy, it is time to remember and act on these words of 
		Jacob: âarouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may 
		awake from the slumber of deathâ (Jacob 3:11).&nbsp; You see, the slacker 
		mentalityâthe attitude that getting worked up about things is somehow 
		uncoolâis dangerous, and its companion, distorted vision, is absolutely 
		perilous.&nbsp; Isaiah solemnly warns us against such dangers: âWo unto them 
		that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light, and 
		light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!â&nbsp; 
		(Isaiah 5:20, 2 Nephi 15:20).&nbsp; Be careful. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">Those that put evil for good are 
		increasingly common, and the evil that they try to substitute for good 
		is becoming increasingly brazen.&nbsp; We could all list several prominent 
		examples of darkness that is accepted and even celebrated as light.&nbsp; But 
		identifying flagrant evil in the world is the easy part.&nbsp; The greater 
		challenge is to recognize in our own lives the seemingly small missteps 
		whose cumulative effects turn out the lights and make it hard to see 
		things as they really are.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">For example, you may not rage against

		sleep?&nbsp; Think of the songs that you have on your iPOD, the DVDs that you 
		buy or rent, the websites that you visit, the books that you read, the 
		games that you play, and the clothes that you wear.&nbsp; Do those choices 
		reveal increasing spiritual sleepiness or heightened spiritual 
		alertness?&nbsp; Do they reveal a pattern of growing or diminishing light?&nbsp; 
		Are you increasingly able to see and discern, or is everything more and 
		more blurry?</span></font></p>

		had no idea that I wasnât seeing things the way they really are.&nbsp; I

		Satan would have you believe that spiritual blurriness is normal.&nbsp; Where 
		there is simplicity, he will offer complications; where there is 
		clarity, he will offer exceptions to the rule.&nbsp; Where there is 
		sharpness, he will offer blurriness.&nbsp; Among other ways, he blurs our 
		vision by inviting and enticing to sin (Moroni 7:12).&nbsp; When we sin, we 
		immediately begin to lose focus, but the change occurs in such tiny 
		increments that it is all but imperceptible.&nbsp; To further blur the 
		difference between right and wrong, light and darkness, our enemy 
		dismisses, mocks, and attacks divine standards, offering in their place 
		his own phony standards.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

		try to refocus, he will tell you that there is nothing wrong with your 
		eyes and that things are always blurry in the âreal world.â&nbsp; He will try 
		to convince you that the âMolly Mormonâ and âPeter Priesthoodâ types all 
		around you are the ones with the eye problem.&nbsp; He will encourage you to 
		disparage their faithfulness by calling it blind obedience.&nbsp; He may try 
		to persuade you that their obedience is really fear of seeing things 
		that you have now dared to see.&nbsp; He will tell you that you can handle 
		movies or magazines or websites that are too much for others.&nbsp; He will 
		talk you into feeling that your independence is threatened by 
		invitations to come back to the light.&nbsp; He would have you believe that 
		youâve outgrown kid stuff like doctrine, principles, commandments, and 
		covenants.&nbsp; He will lie to you, insisting that sin wonât affect your 
		ability to feel the Spirit.&nbsp; Finally, and make no mistake about this, he

		Those safeguards are individual and family prayer, individual and family 
		scripture study, and regular, meaningful family home evening.&nbsp; President 
		Faust called these practices safeguards for a reason.&nbsp; I have learned 
		with the 68<sup>th</sup> Ward that neglecting any one of them decreases 
		the light and increases the spiritual danger.&nbsp; We have also learned that 
		obeying this simple counsel is an important way to âcontinue in Godâ and 
		thus to walk in safely lit paths.&nbsp; As bishop, I have yet to meet with 
		anyone in the 68<sup>th</sup> Ward in serious spiritual trouble who was 
		carefully and conscientiously seeking light through focused scripture 
		study, sincere prayer and purposeful family home evening.&nbsp; Sadly, I have 
		met with many members of the ward who had adopted a checklist approach 
		to these safeguards.&nbsp; The resulting light was insufficient to light 
		their path, and they stumbled.&nbsp; Be careful.</font></span></p>

		a simple but effective mechanism. But I had to pedal to make it work! I 
		learned quickly that if I stopped pedaling my bicycle, the light would 
		go out. I also learned that when I was âanxiously engagedâ in pedaling, 
		the light would become brighter and the darkness in front of me would be

<span style="background: white">sunlight</span> to brighten your way.â</font></span><span class="EndnoteRefe"><font color="#000080" size="1">6</font></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">If we are expecting a flood of light in 
		response to our prayers, we might miss the Lordâs subtle efforts to 
		bless and lead us.&nbsp; Rather than blessing us with a burst of brilliant 
		light all at once, the Lord blesses us with carefully timed and situated 
		packets of light.&nbsp; Those packets are vital to our success, but we wonât 
		find them unless we are in the paths that the Lord has prepared (Alma 
		41:8).&nbsp; As part of that preparation, the Lord has foreseen our needs and 
		our capacitiesâand not in a generic, one-size-fits-all way!&nbsp; He has 
		placed packets of light in our path both in individually appropriate 
		doses and at the intervals that will both stretch and rescue us in our 
		own unique circumstances.&nbsp; As we receive, remember, and act on the 
		truths in one customized packet of light, we prepare to receive new 
		light, and the light grows brighter and brighter.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt">Our final phrase:<b> and that light

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">In the meantime, we are sometimes so

		Elder Talmage was shocked to see just how superior the vendorâs lamp 
		was.&nbsp; He says, âIts light made bright the remotest corner of my room.&nbsp; 
		In its brilliant blaze my own little [lamp] burned a weak, pale yellow.&nbsp;

		inviting me to your grand day of celebration. Look at all you have to 
		celebrate: youve finally passed American Heritage; youve landed a job 
		that pays more than an early-morning custodian; you can stop eating 
		ramen noodles and the yellow death which I understand is mac and cheese; 
		youll no longer have to endure the bitter winds crossing the Taylor 
		quad; you wont have to remember every element of the periodic table; 
		you wont have to rack your brain for the most original way to ask out 
		that prospective eternal companion because 300-plus of you have already 
		found them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Like most people in 
		the small town where I grew up, my grandmother Dansie never had the 
		opportunity to go to college. Nevertheless, she was a lifelong learner. 
		She loved literature, was a columnist for the <i>Midvale Sentinel,</i> 
		was always learning new skillsfrom canning fruit to how to get her 
		chickens to lay more eggs. And she vowed that her children would attend 
		college.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">When my father 
		finished high school, she helped him find a scholarship from the Union 
		Pacific Railroad. With such a commitment to education in my family, 
		there was no question that I, too, would attend college, no matter what 
		it took.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">I remember in 1958 
		leaving my home in Herriman, Utah, to attend the university. I was so 
		excited to venture out of my little town. <i>You all remember the 
		feeling!</i> But that first weekend at school I became so homesick I was 
		physically ill and feared my heart was going to break. Some of you may 
		also know how that feels. Even though I was attending the same 
		university as my sister and brother, all I wanted to do was go home to 
		the safety of hand-stitched quilts, to the gruff but tender care of my 
		dad, to the gentle arms of my mother in her warm kitchen. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">I knew I was 
		supposed to go to school. But facing the enormity of that endeavor 
		filled me with doubt. And so I found a ride home. Hugging the passenger 
		door as we drove past our small two-room school and the old ward house, 
		I felt completely alone. Finally, I saw the sign for our familys storeDansies 
		place. I was home.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">My mom and dad were 
		shocked to see me on their doorstep. I was relieved. Sitting with my dad 
		in his big brown leather chair, I sobbed as I recounted my heartaches 
		and isolation so many miles away.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Dad was a farmer, a 
		tough but caring man. Having served a mission during the Depression, he 
		knew something about hardships. He could have called me weak or rushed 
		to counsel me, yet he just listened and held me and finally said, You 
		dont have to go back if you dont want to.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Now, as a parent 
		myself, I know in his heart he was hoping that I would go backbut he 
		was not going to force me. He simply told me he had faith in me, that I 
		could do it. But still he let me decide. Somehow that gave me enough 
		faith to return to school and face my fears. Four years later, I was 
		sitting where you are, diploma earned, ready to face the world.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Im sure there have 
		been many challenges <i>youve</i> faced here at school that you thought 
		youd never get through. Yet you had the faith not to give up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Faith precedes the 
		miracle; your graduation is a reward for your faith. It is probably more 
		of a miracle for some of you than for others! If you can pass American 
		Heritage, you can do anything! Dont forget that!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">And guess what? 
		Feelings of doubt, insecurity, and fear dont end with the specter of 
		American Heritage! They will continue through your lifefrom whom you 
		will marry, to what job youll take, from where youll live, to how you 
		will live with teenagers. I promise you, the list is endless. But guess 
		what else? If you havent realized it, by your braving the uncharted 
		waters of BYUI youve learned a great life lesson: how to move forward 
		in the face of fear or doubt. Youve learned to rely on faith. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">President Hinckley 
		has said that faith allows us to look beyond the problems of the moment 
		to the miracles of the future (Lord, Increase Our Faith, <i>Ensign,</i> 
		Nov. 1987, 53). Dont you love that? Can you take that with you from BYUIdaho?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">One of your 
		classmates wrote: The Lord has given me the opportunity to develop my 
		faith that was scraping bottom only a year ago. Through the events and 
		people here at BYUIdaho and my effort to reach out to the Lord for all 
		my support despite my smallness of faith, I have no doubt that the Lord 
		chose to bless me with greater faith and teach me to trust Him. My 
		experiences here strengthen my understanding that God really does have a 
		loving and demanding plan for my life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">I love her phrase a 
		loving and demanding plan for my life. I believe that He has such a 
		plan for each of usour patriarchal blessings are evidence of that plan. 
		Of course, finding and following that plan requires faith. Could this be 
		one reason why faith is the first principle of the gospel? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Faith is more than a 
		powerful religious principle; it is fundamental to everything we do.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Faith is the key 
		principle of science. Successful experimentation begins with faith in a 
		positive outcome. If Thomas Edison had not had faith that incandescent 
		light could be produced, would he have tried those hundreds of different 
		filament materials before he found the successful one?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Faith is essential 
		in business ventures. What entrepreneur would start a new business if 
		she did not have faith there was a market for her product or service?&nbsp; 
		What investor would invest in a company if he did not have faith that he 
		would receive a profit? Customers need faith in your honesty and 
		integrity if you are to succeed in business. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Rewarding 
		relationships are based on faith. Knowing what kind of person you want 
		to marry and where that kind of person can be found will affect where 
		and how you foster new friendships. Committing to get married requires 
		faith, despite limited finances or divorced parents or other obstacles. 
		But being single when you hoped to be married also requires great faith, 
		and to you young single adult women, who have a special place in my 
		heart, I know the Lord loves you, is mindful of you, and needs the 
		contributions you have to make. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">When my husband, 
		Jim, was serving as bishop of a singles ward, a couple came to him for 
		counsel. They said they were in love with each other. They both had good 
		jobs and good incomes, but they were worried they would not be able to 
		make it financially. Jim had encountered that concern many times. That 
		night he asked me if, when we were engaged, I had worried whether we 
		would make it financially. I told him I hadnt. After all, we were in 
		love with each other and we knew things would work out. That may sound 
		naïve, but exercising faith frequently does. I worry if couples today 
		confuse wants with needs, thinking they need more than necessary to 
		start a marriage. My husband and I learned much from our struggles 
		during many lean years together. Our mutual faith sustained us. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">In pursuing Heavenly 
		Fathers plan for you, you will face challenges that seem 
		insurmountable. It will appear that things will not work out. In those 
		dark moments, remember your days here and what you accomplished. 
		Heavenly Father always keeps His promises if you believe and doubt not. 
		Of course, thats easier said than doneespecially when relief is 
		nowhere in sight. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Since he was eight, 
		our oldest son wanted to be a filmmaker. He spent much of his growing-up 
		years making Super-8 movies about vampires and space. He continued 
		making films in high school and into college. Jim and I secretly hoped 
		it was a phase that he would outgrow. But his mission call was to Los 
		Angeles (home of Hollywood!). Our son knew he loved making movies but 
		worried about its financial stability, the moral climate of the 
		entertainment industry, the time required away from family to shoot a 
		film. But he felt inspired to become a filmmaker despite the many 
		challenges it would pose.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">He graduated from a 
		well-respected film school and began working as a filmmaker in Los 
		Angeles. There were many times that he was close to directing a 
		full-length film. But, for one reason or another, nothing ever worked 
		out. Being so close yet so far from achieving his dream was agonizing, 
		but he persisted. All the while, he couldnt understand why he had felt 
		guided to pursue film. After a great deal of spiritual wrestling, he 
		felt strongly inspired to consider teaching filmmaking at a university 
		outside of California. This was very difficult for him because he was 
		sure that leaving L.A. would mean leaving behind his lifelong dream. But 
		eventually he decided that he would follow the promptings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">It was only five and 
		a half months after he and his family had moved from Los Angeles that he 
		was hired to produce a feature film. It came unexpectedly, without any 
		effort on his part. And then, only weeks after completing production on 
		that film, he was hired to direct another. Who would have guessed that 
		he would have to leave Hollywood to make a movie, that he would have to 
		lose his dream to find it? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Elder Jeffrey R. 
		Holland observed, Faith is to agree unconditionallyand in advanceto 
		whatever conditions God may require in both the near and distant 
		future.<i> </i>(Jeffrey R. Holland, <i>Christ and the New Covenant</i>, 
		18-19). I dont know about you, but that sounds a bit frightening to me. 
		But if we remember that Heavenly Father loves us so very much that He 
		sent His Only Begotten Son to be sacrificed for our sakes, we can have 
		faith that Gods requirements will give us experience and shall be for 
		our good.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Such faith in a 
		loving Heavenly Father and His obedient Son should motivate us and 
		influence all of our choices, including how we deal with our doubts. 
		True faith always moves its possessor to some kind of physical and 
		mental action; it carries an assurance . . . of the things hoped for 
		(Faith, Bible Dictionary, 670).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">Thank you, parents, 
		for having faith in your children, praying for them, paying for them, 
		encouraging them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
<font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><font size="3">In addition to 
		support from your families, you have been supported by Saints around the 
		worldmany of whom have not attended college themselves. But because of 
		their faith, they paid their tithing. How can you thank them for their 
		sacrifices? As I witness the Church in action around the world, I see 
		those Saints who have been educated through the Church schools. They are 
		blessing their families, the Church and their communities. </font><i>
<font size="3">Go and do likewise.</font></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">President Hinckley 
		said: The BYU experience . . . should<i>it must</i>leave an 
		everlasting impression upon you. . . . It should become an inseparable 
		part of your very nature, something almost intangible but of great 
		substance (The BYU Experience, in <i>Brigham Young University 199798

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#000080">That same faith that 
		brought you to BYUIdaho and has supported you while here can sustain 
		you through life, through the knowns and unknownsand there will be many 
		of these! With faith you can find work you enjoy, find an eternal 
		companion, raise a righteous family, face and overcome hard things. With 
		faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you will be sustained. I pray that you 
		will be able to feel the love of the Lord daily as you seek to do His 
		will with faith. Congratulations, graduates, and God bless you. In the

<span style="font-family: Times">The Army of Helaman</span></u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In Alma, chapters 56 and 57, 
		we read the story of the 2,000 young men of the people of Ammon who 
		volunteered to fight in the great war between the Nephites and the 
		Lamanites.&nbsp; This is the army of Helaman. &nbsp;Theirs is a story of faith and 
		courage.&nbsp; With no previous experience, but with great faith, they went 
		to war and fought with miraculous strength under the leadership of 
		Helaman.&nbsp; They faced the Lamanites in many battles, but not one of them 
		was killed. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In Alma 57:27, Helaman 
		describes the characteristics that set his army apart:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in"><font color="#000080">Now

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The young men of the army of

		I imagine that these young men had been raised on stories of the great 
		prophets like Nephi.&nbsp; They knew of the power of obedience, and they put

		remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to

		army of Helaman.&nbsp; The only sure power of deliverance is to be as the

		help you secure and sustain the faith and trust you need: always keep 
		the commandments of God, no matter what.&nbsp; No matter how poor you are, no 
		matter what problems arise, always pay your tithing.&nbsp; No matter what 
		situations you are in or temptations you face, always live the Word of 
		Wisdom.&nbsp; Always hold family home evening, keep the Sabbath day holy, and 
		pray morning and night.&nbsp; Never compromise your divine heritage as sons

		practical you can do to avoid the distractions, fear, corruption, and 
		darkness of the world and have minds that are firm: establish an 
		architecture of righteousness in your daily life.&nbsp; Build a structure in 
		your daily life around four activities: (1) have personal and family 
		prayer morning and night; (2) get up early and study and ponder the 
		scriptures for at least 30&nbsp;minutes every day, and then read the 
		scriptures together as a family, every day; (3)&nbsp;hold a temple recommend 
		and (if you live close enough) go to the temple every week; and (4) do 
		missionary workshare the gospel; invite people to read the Book of 
		Mormon, meet with the missionaries, or attend Church with you.&nbsp; I give 
		you a promise: if you do these things in faith and diligence, you will 
		not fear, nor be weary; your minds will be firm; and you will have 
		courage and strength beyond your own. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i><u>They are Young</u></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The members of the army of 
		Helaman were young men (Helaman says they were very young), but their 
		age was not what mattered in their faith.&nbsp; What really mattered was that 
		they were young in heart.&nbsp; They were fresh and new, energetic and 
		enthusiastic. They were childlike in their willingness to do whatever 
		Helaman asked them to do.&nbsp; Their obedience was so precise and so careful 
		that Helaman said of them, . . . they did obey and observe . . . every 
		word of command with exactness . . . .</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">14</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All this means that in their 
		character, in their attitudes, and in their hearts, the young men in the 
		army of Helaman were children of Christ.&nbsp; They were like the people of 
		King Benjamin who made sacred covenants with the Lord and were . . . 
		called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters . . . .</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">15</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">If you would be as the army 
		of Helaman, you, too, must be young in heart.&nbsp; You must be a child of 
		Christ and, in the words of King Benjamin:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">. . 
		. [put] off the natural man and [become] a saint through the atonement 
		of Christ the Lord, and [become] as a child, submissive, meek, humble, 
		patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord 
		seeth fit to inflict upon [you], even as a child doth submit to his 
		father.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">16</font></span></span><font color="#000080" size="1">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Here is something very 
		practical you can do to be a child of Christ: always accept and always 
		magnify callings in the Church, and always volunteer to be of service in 
		the kingdom.&nbsp; If your bishop calls you to be the nursery leader, accept 
		and magnify.&nbsp; If your stake president calls you to be the stake director 
		of physical activities or the Young Women camp director, accept and 
		magnify.&nbsp; When opportunities come to volunteer for service, be the first 
		person with your hand in the air, the first person with your name on the 
		sign-up sheet.&nbsp; When the call goes out to shovel the sidewalks, or set 
		up chairs, or take a meal to a ward member, or make a visit to the 
		hospital, be the first one to stand up and say, . . . Here am I; send 
		me.</font><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">17</font></span></span></p>

		architecture of righteousness in your daily life through prayer, 
		scripture study, service in the temple, and sharing the gospel; always 
		accept and magnify callings in the Church, and always volunteer for 
		service in the kingdom.&nbsp; I bear witness to you that if you do these

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>This coming Tuesday I will give a devotional talk that I have worked on for months. &nbsp;I will speak to students about raising their personal bar of righteousness and becoming disciples of the Savior by listening to the whisperings of the Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord often gives students personal, quiet, individual promptings about how to improve, as He gives such promptings to each of us. &nbsp;Through those &ldquo;commandments not a few,&rdquo; <sup>[1]</sup> the Lord invites us to do things that will deepen and strengthen our discipleship and move us forward on a path toward eternal life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my address, I will speak about the process of listening to the Spirit, the path of discipleship, and three specific things students can do to raise their personal bar of righteousness and become disciples of the Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) &nbsp; <em>Serve in the Church</em>.&nbsp; I will talk about home and visiting teaching as an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Fulfill classroom responsibilities</em>.&nbsp; This topic is very specific to BYU-Idaho and stems from an understanding of the future of the Learning Model.&nbsp; I will emphasize two points:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about the implications of these principles.&nbsp; Think of the difference it would make in education if each student would come prepared to be taught and to teach. &nbsp;When students come prepared, they not only help themselves but they bless everybody else.&nbsp; When they don&rsquo;t come prepared, they take away from the experience.&nbsp; This is an important part of raising one&rsquo;s personal bar of righteousness and helping to build Zion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) &nbsp; <em>Dress appropriately</em>.&nbsp; The Spirit will teach those who are willing to obey that how they dress for class is important for two reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To build Zion we need to become pure in heart.&nbsp; In Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, the Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith a very important principle about the nature of learning and classrooms.&nbsp; As He gave the Prophet instructions about how to create a house of learning, the Lord said:&nbsp; &ldquo;And above all things&rdquo; <sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;&mdash;that would seem to mean the most important thing He had yet said&mdash;&ldquo;clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantel, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.&rdquo; <sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, as He described the salute to those who entered the School of the Prophets, He said, &ldquo;I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother through the grace of God in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo; <sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To build Zion, we need to create those bonds of charity.&nbsp; We need to be &ldquo;fixed, immovable, and unchangeable&rdquo; <sup>[5]</sup> in our commitment to our students and to each other&mdash;to be bound together &ldquo;in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, forever and ever.&rdquo; <sup>[6]</sup>&nbsp; The process we need to go through is described in Moroni, chapter 7.&nbsp; This is Mormon&rsquo;s great sermon on faith, hope, and charity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this chapter, Mormon teaches us something very important about the power of the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; Verse 44 states, &ldquo;none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.&rdquo; <sup>[7]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verse 45 is also very important.&nbsp; The Lord teaches us about the power of love.&nbsp; As you listen to these words, think about your work in this university, as a teacher, in this college, and as a member of Zion.&nbsp; &ldquo;And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&rdquo; <sup>[8]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mormon continues, &ldquo;But charity is the pure love of Christ.&rdquo; <sup>[9]</sup>&nbsp; Then, he teaches us what we must do: &ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;<sup> [10]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This love is a gift of the Spirit bestowed by the Father upon all who are true followers of His Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the last part of verse 48: &ldquo;that ye may become the sons of God.&rdquo; <sup>[11]</sup>&nbsp; Of course, this also applies to the daughters of God, &ldquo;that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.&rdquo; <sup>[12]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is our assignment and our responsibility. &nbsp;We build Zion in our community through the desires and purity of our hearts, through praying with all the energy of our hearts that the Lord will bless us with His pure love. &nbsp;When you enter into the classroom, you take that love with you and your students feel it. &nbsp;They are inspired by the love you have for them. &nbsp;You create an environment in which your students learn, and the Holy Ghost is there. &nbsp;The Spirit ministers to your students. &nbsp;They feel the power of Heaven speaking to them, teaching them in ways that transform their lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will end with three final points I believe will help us build Zion and create the kind of environment the Lord desires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) &nbsp; <em>Start each class with a prayer</em>. &nbsp;It does not need to be long. &nbsp;Teach students that their public prayers should be short. &nbsp;During classroom prayers, you should stand, not kneel. &nbsp;These prayers should invite the Lord, His blessings, and the Spirit to be with you in class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp; <em>Attend devotional in person</em>. &nbsp;Be where your students can see you. &nbsp;Come and participate in the great spirit that is there. &nbsp;I promise if you come in person, there will be an even greater spirit there. &nbsp;There will be a greater outpouring of the Lord&rsquo;s blessings upon both you and your students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">3) &nbsp; <em>Dress appropriately for class</em>. &nbsp;Be careful that you do not become casual in your dress. &nbsp;We are going to ask the students to dress up a notch. &nbsp;I encourage you to do the same. &nbsp;Look carefully at what you wear and how you present yourselves to students. &nbsp;Dress in a manner that will inspire your students when they look to you. &nbsp;Allow them to see the light of Christ in your countenance. Dress in a way that shows you love them and are serious about this work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let me express something I have learned about you. &nbsp;Heavenly Father loves you. &nbsp;I have been blessed with a testimony that God our Father loves the faculty at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;He loves you. &nbsp;Your work is known in the heavens. &nbsp;The Lord Jesus Christ loves you. &nbsp;This is His university. &nbsp;He watches over us, and He loves us. &nbsp;If you ever get discouraged, if you ever feel no one cares, I pray you will get on your knees and talk to your Heavenly Father. &nbsp;I promise you will receive the peace and warmth that comes to those who are faithful and true to their covenants and who labor in this vineyard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave you my testimony that this is His work. &nbsp;We have all been greatly blessed to be part of this great university. &nbsp;Sue and I thank the Lord every day for this opportunity. &nbsp;What a blessing it has been in our lives to be associated with you, to be able to work together in this great work. &nbsp;I leave you my testimony and my love in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Lord promises His disciples great 
		blessings, including commandments not a few. This phrase, 
		commandments not a few, contains important insights about the nature 
		of discipleship and what we must do to become true disciples of the 
		Savior.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Lords disciples are obedient to the 
		commandments given to all members of the Church.&nbsp; But in this passage

		Elder David A. Bednar described these personal commandments this way:</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In order to develop and deepen our

		personal bar falls below that baseline, if we fail to pay our tithing,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I have noticed, for example, that jeans

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Every time you walk into a classroom on 
		this campus, you are walking into a space that has been dedicated and 
		set apart by the prophets of God.&nbsp; This is the Lords university, a 
		temple of learning, a disciple preparation center.&nbsp; When you look in the 
		mirror in the morning before you walk on this campus, say to yourself: 
		I want to be a disciple of the Savior; and I am going to look like, and 
		act like, and, in fact, be a disciple of the Savior today.&nbsp; If it is a 
		devotional day, dress in your temple best.&nbsp; On other days remember who 
		you are and wear clothes that are a notch or two up from jeans and 
		T-shirts. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">
<font color="#000080">Now, you may wonder why what you wear is 
		important.&nbsp; After all, the Lord has said, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;man looketh on the 
		outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</font></span><sup><font color="#000080" size="1">13</font></sup><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font color="#000080">&nbsp; 
		I want your hearts to be pure and your faith to be true, but I think 
		there are two reasons why what you wear to class is important.&nbsp; First, 
		like being on time, it is a sign of your respect for the process of 
		learning and teaching that occurs in those dedicated places.&nbsp; It is a 
		measure of your respect for everyone involved in that processincluding 
		your classmates, the faculty, and especially the Holy Ghost. </font>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Second, what you wear affects how you 
		and those around you behave.&nbsp; Simply said, your dress will affect how 
		you and your classmates engage in the learning process and how much you 
		learn.&nbsp; If you come to class better dressed, you will help to establish 
		a sense of respect, seriousness of purpose, and focus that will affect 
		how the class works.&nbsp; Through your obedience and through raising your 
		personal bar, you will bring a better spirit to class and help to create 
		an environment in which the Holy Ghost can minister, not only to you, 
		but everyone around you.&nbsp; This means that raising your personal bar for 
		dress and grooming is not just about you.&nbsp; It is an act of faith, 
		kindness, service, and love for those around you.&nbsp; It is a powerful step 
		on the path of discipleship. </span></font></p>

<span style="color: #000080">Allow me to begin by sharing two stories:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">Some years ago while serving as a stake 
		president, I pled with the Lord that He would direct my feet to someone 
		for whom I might turn priesthood keys in inviting them back into the 
		fold.&nbsp; At the time I was traveling rather frequently in my work.&nbsp; One 
		Monday morning I got on the flight that I took regularly to Salt Lake 
		City where I was doing some work for the Church.&nbsp; Only this morning I 
		did something that I had never done before.&nbsp; As I checked in, I felt 
		prompted to change my seat to the back of the plane.&nbsp; I never sit in the 
		back of the plane.&nbsp; I like to get as close to the front as possible so 
		that I can make a quick get away as soon as we touch down.&nbsp; How grateful 
		I am that I followed this prompting.&nbsp; I made my way to the back of the 
		plane and took my seat.&nbsp; As I did so, a man in the row ahead of me asked 
		if I would mind sitting with him.&nbsp; I looked around in surprise and 
		agreed to do so.&nbsp; After exchanging pleasantries about the work that took 
		each of us to Salt Lake, he said that he was a member of the Mormon 
		Church but that he had been highly inactive for years.&nbsp; This confession 
		seemed to open a floodgate of emotion as he began to express details of 
		the many and deep indiscretions that had led him away from the Church.&nbsp; 
		After a few minutes I interrupted him and said, While I appreciate your 
		openness, before you go any further I should let you know that I am 
		probably your Stake President.&nbsp; He slowed, only ever so slightly, and 
		said, Yes, I thought that I recognized you as my Stake President.&nbsp; I 
		have seen you get on this flight and sit up front several times in 
		recent months and have just been hoping that we might have the chance to 
		talk.&nbsp; May we continue?&nbsp; We spoke non-stop for the rest of the flight 
		and many other times in the months that followed.&nbsp; It was easy to 
		develop a deep love for this brother and new friend as we walked 
		together through his repentance process.&nbsp; I asked him often, What in 
		the world was it that prompted you to make such a dramatic change in 
		lifestyle as you have come back into the Church?&nbsp; He was always very 
		clear that he felt a burning within his soul that there was something 
		far more meaningful in life than the worlds high life that he was 
		then living.&nbsp; He was driven to get back in touch with the real meaning 
		that he had experienced years earlier.&nbsp; He was looking for purpose 
		beyond that which the world can offer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">Now a second story . . . the August 2006 <i>
		Ensign</i> provides a touching story of Liz Shropshire, who was a single 
		adult member of the Church living in California.&nbsp; Liz was also a music 
		teacher and composer.&nbsp; She decided to visit Austria because of its rich 
		musical heritage.&nbsp; Shortly after Liz purchased her ticket to Europe, 
		she heard a heartbreaking radio account about the ethnic cleansing of 
		minority groups then taking place in Kosovo.&nbsp; Liz says that as she heard 
		of the suffering of these people, her heart became so filled that she 
		felt that she needed to be there.&nbsp; To make a most touching story short, 
		she did go to Kosovo to share her musical gifts with the suffering.&nbsp; Her 
		music brought a glimmer of joy to hundreds and then thousands of people 
		who had so little joy in their lives.&nbsp; Over time she spread her message 
		of hope through music to other countriesbenefiting now over 8,000 
		people.&nbsp; Liz says, I knew that what Id been doing in Kosovo felt more 
		right than anything else Id done in years.&nbsp; Before I came, I felt Id 
		just been living for myself.&nbsp; Looking at various experiences Id had in 
		my life, I felt that this was something Id been prepared to do.&nbsp; I used 
		to think that being rich simply meant having money.&nbsp; But I have realized 
		that being rich means being able to share whatever it is were blessed 
		with.&nbsp; Although I have never had less of the things of the world than I 
		have now, I have never been so rich.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">Each of these two people found deep within 
		themselves a burning desire to identify and then fulfill their core 
		purpose.&nbsp; One used this desire to lift himself out of serious problems, 
		the other to raise herself above the routine of day-to-day life.&nbsp; The 
		Lord refers to this core purpose as the measure of our creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
		taught that after our soul hath filled the measure of its creation, it 
		shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the 
		Father.²&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">What is the measure of our creation?&nbsp; 
		Remember, Elder Wirthlin taught that the measure of our creation is to 
		achieve exaltation and eternal life, to be crowned with glory, even with 
		the presence of God the Father.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters the measure of our 
		creation is to live again with God and to realize the invitation to 
		become like Him.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">We are children of Father in Heaven.&nbsp; He 
		really is our Father.&nbsp; He has only one purpose in His own experience and 
		for us His children:&nbsp; that we return home to Himpure and clean and 
		ready to inherit all that He has.&nbsp; You see brothers and sisters, the 
		gospel is not overly complicated.&nbsp; In fact the gospel is really quite 
		simple.&nbsp; Now I didnt say the gospel was easy; I said that it is 
		simple.&nbsp; There are no trick questionsno surprises.&nbsp; We all left our 
		home with Father committed to successfully navigate the challenges that 
		we would find in this telestial earthly experience.&nbsp; Father knew it 
		would be hard because of the tremendous temptations and pressures of 
		this telestial existence.&nbsp; Although we have been instructed that no 
		unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God (Alma 40:26) Father knew 
		that none of His children save one would obey Him perfectly.&nbsp; As a 
		result, he sent that one sonHis firstbornHis only begotten in the 
		flesh to pay a ransom that would open the door for us to return home if 
		we, through Christs atonement and advocacy, fulfill the measure of our 
		creation.&nbsp; Speaking of the many telestial distractions to this glorious 
		measure of our creation, President Brigham Young counseled: </span></p>

		requirements of the Celestial law, and obey the commandments of our God. 
		It is then, and then only, you may expect that the blessing of eternal 
		lives will be conferred upon you. It can be obtained upon no other

<span style="color: #000080">Now, HOW do we fulfill this glorious

		each of us can do:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>
<span style="color: #000080">Firstly, fulfilling the measure of our

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>
<span style="color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">We will never fulfill the measure of our 
		creation until we have a deep and burning testimony that we are sons and 
		daughters of Father and that He wants us home.&nbsp; Without first accepting 
		this core doctrine, it is impossible to fulfill the measure of our 
		creation.&nbsp; Paul clearly taught who we are when he wrote:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

		<span style="color: #000080">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our 
		spirit, that we are the children of God: </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">The adversary would love to distract us 
		from this profound truth.&nbsp; I know a man who once said that he simply 
		does not believe that he is cut out to be celestial material.&nbsp; He said 
		that while he loves the idea and believes that others may achieve such a 
		glorious eternity, because of poor choices that he has made, he simply 
		does not believe that these blessings could possibly be for him.&nbsp; As a 
		result, he professes to be satisfied with a telestial lifestyle and 
		inheritance.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, this is to buy in to one of the 
		greatest lies in Satan's seemingly endless arsenal.&nbsp; Never, <i>no never</i>, 
		accept the lie that you are just not celestial material.&nbsp; You were 
		celestial material before you came to this earth.&nbsp; You are celestial 
		material as you journey through this telestial experience, and you will 
		continue to be celestial material as you do all that you can do and then 
		rely on the Saviors marvelous gift to carry you through the hardest 
		parts of life.&nbsp; That is exactly what He is there for.&nbsp; I testify to each 
		and every one of you that we are all within the healing power of the 
		Saviors atonementthat is what makes you Celestial material.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">I am always interested in how we view and 
		describe ourselves.&nbsp; Some might say, Oh, I am just a C student, or I am 
		an athlete, I am a pre-med student, I am from Boston or Kansas City.&nbsp; 
		Brothers and sisters, while these descriptions may accurately describe 
		aspects of your life, you are not at your essence a C student, you are 
		not at your essence star athletes, you are not at your essence a pre-med 
		student, and even as much as I love Boston and Kansas City, that still 
		does not describe my essence.&nbsp; Please do not allow a singular focus on 
		these telestial aspects of your life to lead you away from your 
		celestial essence.&nbsp; You came to this earth fit for the kingdom.&nbsp; You are 
		still fit for the kingdom, if you choose so to be.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color: #000080">I remember talking with a woman in our 
		stake who expressed to me her feeling of inadequacy; she said that she 
		felt dumb, even worthless.&nbsp; In one of those remarkable experiences of a 
		priesthood leader being inspired to turn keys on behalf of a child of 
		God, I told her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as I now tell you, 
		that if you have grown up with friends, parents, husbands, wives or 
		others who have convinced you that you are worthless, inadequate, or not 
		cut out for all that Father has, this is a lie.&nbsp; I promise you that if 
		Father were here in person He would not describe us in those terms.&nbsp; He

		to your heart and soul.&nbsp; I promise you that He will remind your spirit 
		what it knew before it came to this side of the veilwe are His 
		children, He does love us, He has promised us a share of all that He 
		has.&nbsp; Once you have received that testimony in your heart, regardless of 
		your telestial circumstances and achievements or temporary failures, you 
		will never succumb to Satans lie that you are anything short of an

<span style="color: #000080">Let me describe priesthood home leadership 
		by first describing what it is not.&nbsp; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 121 
		could not be clearer that it is the nature and disposition of almost 
		all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they 
		will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.&nbsp; Priesthood 
		home leadership is not to dominate, order, or bully our wives or 
		children.&nbsp; We are counseled in Section 121 that when we undertake to 
		cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to 
		exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the 
		children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens 
		withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is 
		withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.&nbsp; Now 
		what does this mean?&nbsp; Our priesthood ordinations certainly pronounce 
		upon us sacred responsibility and authority.&nbsp; However priesthood power 
		will only come to a man when he leads with persuasion, by 
		long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By 
		kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
		without hypocrisy, and without guile--Reproving betimes with sharpness, 
		when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an 
		increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee 
		to be his enemy; That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than 
		the cords of death.&nbsp; Make no mistake brethren, a priesthood ordination 
		may give you sacred responsibility and authority, but priesthood power 
		only comes to a man who is both ordained and leads in the Lords way.&nbsp; 
		If you do not lead His way, there is no priesthood power in your life.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000080">What did I tell my young friend who felt 
		constrained by the principle of obedience?&nbsp; The same thing that I 
		counsel you this afternoon.&nbsp; I told her that she absolutely has choice.&nbsp; 
		The first question we should ask ourselves is whether or not we have 
		accepted Fathers invitation to return to Him and inherit all that He 
		has.&nbsp; Once we accept that glorious proposition, the choice of obedience 
		makes all the sense in the world. Obedience is a choice that becomes 
		delicious to us.&nbsp; My young friend was a gifted musician.&nbsp; I told her 
		that it was much like wanting to be a world class musician or athlete, 
		and then complaining because the teacher or coach tells us that we have 
		to practice.&nbsp; Do we really have to practice?&nbsp; On the one hand, 
		absolutely notto practice or not will always be up to us.&nbsp; However, if 
		my young friend wanted to become a great musician, obedience to the 
		principle of practice is the only way to get there.&nbsp; So it is with us 
		and the gospel of the master Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We have complete freedom of 
		choice to accept or reject Fathers offer to inherit all that He has; we 
		have complete freedom of choice to obey His commandments or not.&nbsp; 
		However we do not have the choice to expect to fulfill the measure of 
		our creation while willfully choosing to disobey the commandments which 
		serve as the only means to that glorious end.&nbsp; There is an eternal law 
		that we cannot have it both ways.&nbsp; Father loves us far too much to bless 
		us for our intended wickedness.&nbsp; Yet he loves us enough to provide hope 
		even when we fall, if the intent of our hearts is right with Him, when 
		we desperately desire above all else to do his will.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000080">Unfortunately in their enthusiasm for the

		teach the gospel with language that suggests that we dont have choice.&nbsp; 
		You cannot take drugs!&nbsp; You cannot live immorally!&nbsp; You cannot view 
		pornography.&nbsp; Something in our souls knows that we have choice and may 
		become confused with such language.&nbsp; Some mistakenly leap from that 
		confusion in their souls to a feeling that there is something wrong with 
		the gospel.&nbsp; Let me assure you, there is nothing wrong with the gospel

<span style="color: #000080">Now, understanding the importance of

		the power to perfect ourselves.&nbsp; Once again Father has a most beautiful 
		response to the dilemma of our occasional sin.&nbsp; He invites us to

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I deeply appreciate 
			this opportunity.&nbsp; At her request, my gift to my wife this evening 
			is not asking her to speak.&nbsp; However, I would like her to come here 
			for just a moment.&nbsp; President Clark mentioned my first book and the 
			movie made from it.&nbsp; The movie followed the book fairly closely so 
			is quite accurate.&nbsp; However, Jean often adds, âBut parts of it were 
			Hollywoodized, as you were never that good a dancer,â which I 
			wasnât.&nbsp; I am eternally grateful, however, that Jean didnât make her 
			decision based on how good a dancer I was.&nbsp; We were not directly 
			involved in the making of the movie.&nbsp; However at one point we were 
			on an assignment in New Zealand when they were filming a segment and 
			had the opportunity of meeting some of the principal actors.&nbsp; When I 
			first met Anne Hathaway, who was playing Jeanâs part, I said, âSo 
			youâre the lucky girl who gets to play the part of my wife.â&nbsp; She 
			seemed a little surprised, then looked at me quizzically and said, 
			âYou really love Jean, donât you?â&nbsp; I replied, âI sure do.&nbsp; I always 
			have, and I always will.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The theme tonight is 
			excellence.&nbsp; Jean is truly a woman of excellence.&nbsp; In the scriptures 
			we read, âBut in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more 
			excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilledâ 
			(Ether 12:11).&nbsp; The Savior is the most excellent way and the most 
			excellent example in all that we do.&nbsp; Following Him moves us towards 
			excellence.&nbsp; I pray we will all do so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">About thirty-five 
			years ago I had the opportunity of teaching part-time at Ricks 
			College for two years. We had just returned from serving as mission 
			president in Tonga and business was down.&nbsp; We had quite a few young 
			mouths to feed and teaching here helped put bread and butter on the 
			table.&nbsp; I remember how kind and thoughtful President John L. Clarke 
			was.&nbsp; Everyone I worked with was helpful and I have had good 
			feelings about Ricks College, now BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho, 
			ever since.&nbsp; I appreciate and love the students, the faculty, the 
			President, and everything associated with this great University.&nbsp; I 
			felt the âSpirit of Ricksâ then and continue to do so today.&nbsp; I pray 
			that all of you will do the same by making good friendships and 
			being helpful to everyone.&nbsp; It will bring you great joy, now and 
			forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I ask for your faith 
			and prayers as we visit this evening on a subject dear to my 
			heartâTemples.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is heard in a talk is much more important than 
			what is said.&nbsp; When a speaker teaches and testifies of the truth, 
			even though he may not give a âspectacular talk,â the spirit of the 
			Lord can take parts of that talk and fracture it into a thousand 
			pieces and plant something important in a thousand different hearts 
			to answer their specific needs.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The temple deals 
			with eternity.&nbsp; All truth is found in the temple because the temple 
			is all about the life and mission of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; In D&amp;C 93:24 we 
			read, âAnd truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they 
			were, and as they are to come.â&nbsp; Truth has no beginning and no end.&nbsp; 
			Only that which lasts forever is real.&nbsp; God is real, truth is real, 
			love is real, life is real, the teachings of the temple are real, 
			unselfishness is real because these things never end.&nbsp; On the other 
			hand, the things of the world, which are here today and gone 
			tomorrow, and often involve selfishness, do not last forever so are 
			unreal or illusionary. You might say, âWait a minute.&nbsp; My car is 
			real, my wardrobe is real (sometimes itâs a real mess) or my hair or 
			something else physical is real.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yes, we do get sick, we 
		may have accidents or hard times, we even die, but remember all of those 
		things are temporary â they donât last forever, so in this sense they 
		are illusions.&nbsp; The things of God are eternal and real, all else is 
		temporary, unreal and illusionary.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I have heard people say 
		when they leave the temple, âOh, it is so hard to leave the beautiful 
		atmosphere of the temple and go back into the real world.â&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
		understand how they feel and I have felt that way myself sometimes.&nbsp; 
		However, I have learned that the&nbsp; temple is the real world because what 
		we learn and do there lasts forever. It is the world we go out into that 
		is unreal because it doesnât last forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">One of the great truths 
		we need to learn in life is that when we do things for selfish reasons, 
		even though we may get what we want, it ends there. On the other hand, 
		when we do things for unselfish reasons, such as sincerely trying to 
		help someone else, it never ends. Selfishness ends, unselfishness 
		doesnât.&nbsp; The scriptures say that charity is the pure love of Christ, 
		which to me means unselfish service given to help others.&nbsp; Charity never 
		fails or has no end.&nbsp; I wonder if selfishness, even more than money, is 
		the root of all evil and unselfishness the root of all good.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we 
		do selfish things, bad things follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we do unselfish things, 
		good things follow.&nbsp; That is why the Savior invites us to follow Him and 
		live the life of unselfishness. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Savior is the most 
		unselfish person that ever lived on this earth.&nbsp; His whole life was 
		about helping others, not Himself.&nbsp; He invites us to follow Him and do 
		likewise. Since everything about the Temple is based upon the life and 
		mission of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, it follows that the work in 
		the temple is based on unselfish service and is the basis of all good.&nbsp; 
		The power of heaven flows to earth through the temples and the 
		ordinances and covenants made therein.&nbsp; Our desire to live clean lives, 
		perform unselfish acts, be good neighbors and become more Christ-like 
		individuals are all enhanced through temple service. Let me repeat, that 
		which we do for our own selfish benefit ends right then but that which 
		we do unselfishly lasts forever.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As this picture shows, 
		The Savior is the connection between heaven and earth.&nbsp; Temples are 
		among the portals he uses to convey His eternal truths to earth.&nbsp; In 
		front of every temple is the phrase: âHoliness to the Lord.&nbsp; The House 
		of the Lord.â&nbsp; The scriptures ask us to âCome unto Christ and be 
		perfected in Himâ (Moroni 10:32). Where is he?&nbsp; How do we find him? 
		Where do we go?&nbsp; We go to His house for that is where He is.&nbsp; Yes, we 
		pray, we read the scriptures, we keep His commandments, we follow the 
		Prophet, and we go to the temple.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I testify that the 
		Savior is the connection between heaven and earth and is the&nbsp; most 
		unselfish person on the face of the earth.&nbsp; I know He lives in heaven, 
		but He is also&nbsp; in His temples.&nbsp; Temples are a bit of heaven on earth.&nbsp; 
		Read with me the words on the screen:&nbsp; âThere is a connection between 
		heaven and earth.&nbsp; Finding that connection makes everything meaningful, 
		including death.&nbsp; Missing that connection makes everything meaningless, 
		including life.â (John H. Groberg, from the movie âThe Other Side of 
		Heavenâ) If we have the Savior and his truths in our lives, life will be 
		full of meaning, otherwise it wonât.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The essence of the 
		temple is the essence of the Saviorâs life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can learn more about 
		Him in the temple than most anywhere. Every time we go to the temple, we 
		learn more about Him.&nbsp; As we learn more about Him, we feel a deeper love 
		for Him and a greater desire to express our gratitude to Him and for all 
		He has done for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We then ask, what can we do to express our 
		gratitude and love?&nbsp; His answer is simple: Keep my commandments and help 
		other people.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When I talk to young 
		people who come to the temple to do baptisms, I always remind them that 
		the Savior was baptized just like they are baptized.&nbsp; When we experience 
		the death of a loved one or face illness either personally or of a 
		friend, we take great comfort in the assurance of the Saviorâs promise 
		that He has overcome all these things and has taken upon Himself the 
		sicknesses, challenges, and pains of His people.&nbsp; He came to help 
		everyone.&nbsp; He did for us that which we cannot do for ourselves.&nbsp; In the 
		temple, He gives us the opportunity to do things for others that they 
		cannot do for themselves.&nbsp; In doing so, we learn of Him and experience 
		some of the joy He has.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray that all of us will qualify and 
		regularly attend the temple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Some people wonder why 
		only qualified members can enter the temple.&nbsp; Think of it this way.&nbsp; 
		What we do in the temple is sacred, but not secret.&nbsp; Usually that which 
		is secret is that which we try to keep to ourselves and not share with 
		others.&nbsp; That which is sacred, including that which is done in the 
		temple, is that which we desire to share with othersâwith everyone, 
		whether they live now or have lived on the earth in the past.&nbsp; Temple 
		work is totally unselfish.&nbsp; We want to share its truths and 
		opportunities with everyone and not keep them to ourselves.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Anyone can enter the 
		temple if they qualify.&nbsp; If some ask, why do I need to qualify? Explain 
		something like this:&nbsp; If you have a powerful new car, would you feel 
		comfortable turning it over to someone who has never driven a car 
		before?&nbsp; If someone does not have the maturity or the understanding to 
		drive a car, allowing him to do so puts him and others at risk and would 
		be a foolish thing to do.&nbsp; People need to qualify to drive a car or to 
		enter the temple.&nbsp; Only as we desire to learn the truths taught in the 
		Temple and show that desire by our actions will we be able to understand 
		and be blessed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Savior explained to 
		his disciples (which includes all of us) that He wanted them to be in 
		the world but not of the world.&nbsp; Temples are in the world but not of the 
		world.&nbsp; The best way to learn how to overcome the tests and trials in 
		this world is to go to the temple.&nbsp; You will have the great blessing in 
		the not too distant future of another temple even closer to you.&nbsp; Please 
		make the new Rexburg Temple a big part of your life.&nbsp; In the meantime, 
		continue attending the Idaho Falls Temple as well as other temples where 
		you may be.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">President Hinckley has 
		said, âI hope you go to the temple more frequently and so, my brothers 
		and sisters, I encourage you to take greater advantage of this blessed 
		privilege.&nbsp; It will refine your natures.&nbsp; It will peel off the selfish 
		shell in which most of us live.&nbsp; It will literally bring a sanctifying 
		element into our lives and make us better men and better women<span class="zr"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">â</font></span></span>
<span class="WP9Hyperlink"><font color="#000080">(</font></span><span class="zr"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">âClosing

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sometimes universities 
		are referred to as temples of learning.&nbsp; The temple of the Lord is the 
		ultimate temple of learning.&nbsp; It invites us to inquire, to learn, to 
		understand and to become better people.&nbsp; Whether we are students, 
		faculty, staff members, or residents, I promise that by attending the 
		temple regularly we will become better students, better researchers, 
		better parents, better spouses, better teachers, better farmers, better 
		doctors or whatever we may be.&nbsp; Attending the temple puts us more in 
		tune with the infinite so we can see things more clearly.&nbsp; It brings us 
		closer to Him who knows more than all and who is the most unselfish of 
		all.&nbsp; It gives us the opportunity to render unselfish service.&nbsp; The 
		temple is where the Savior is and He has invited us to come unto Him.&nbsp;
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Another way of defining 
		the real versus the unreal is referring to Zion versus Babylon. Babylon 
		is the pride of the world or manâs wisdom.&nbsp; Generally Babylon is made up 
		of people, companies and groups who are essentially selfishâstriving for 
		their own ends.&nbsp; The opposite of Babylon is Zion or âthe pure in heartâ 
		(D&amp;C 97:21).&nbsp; Zion is made of individuals or groups of people who are 
		striving to be pure in heart and who know the only way they can do this 
		is to become totally unselfish through following the Savior and always 
		helping others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Isaiah refers to the 
		selfishness or illusion of Babylon as follows:&nbsp; âIt shall even be as 
		when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and 
		his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold he 
		drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath 
		appetite; so shall the multitude of all the nations (peoples) be, that 
		fight against mount Zionâ (Isaiah 29:8).&nbsp; Those who are selfish and 
		persecute those who are unselfish (it has always been that way and 
		probably in this life&nbsp; will always be that way) will one day wake up 
		thinking they have been filled only to find that they are empty.&nbsp; Think 
		of the great and spacious building seen by Lehi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The mobs who eventually 
		killed the Prophet Joseph thought they had put an end to âMormonism.â&nbsp; 
		Years later they wake up and find âMormonismâ stronger than ever.&nbsp; Like 
		those spoken of by Isaiah, their soul is empty and faint.&nbsp; Relying on 
		the arm of flesh will always be frustrating because Babylon is temporary 
		and an illusion.&nbsp; Only Zion, only truth, only unselfishnessâonly the 
		things of God, including His temple, are real and last forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the first section of 
		the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord explains some of the reasons He 
		restored the gospel through Joseph Smith.&nbsp; Letâs read verses 15 and 16.&nbsp; 
		âFor they have strayed from mine ordinances. (Where are ordinances 
		performed?&nbsp; Think of the temple.)&nbsp; They seek not the Lord to establish 
		his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the 
		image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and 
		whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in 
		Babylon, even Babylon the great (which is the selfish part of human 
		nature) which shall fall.â&nbsp; The temple is where we go to receive 
		strength and clear thinking and understanding of what is right.&nbsp; It is 
		where we prepare to resist the evils of the world.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Most of you remember the 
		great tsunami which recently devastated parts of Asia. The only people 
		who were safe were those who got to higher ground.&nbsp; There is a tsunami 
		of sin in the world today.&nbsp; To be safe, we must go to the mount of the 
		Lordâ the temple of the Lord.&nbsp; It is the higher ground.&nbsp; We go from the 
		temporal world to the real world when we go to the temple. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Lord created the 
		earth for many reasons.&nbsp; Let me mention three:&nbsp; 1. So we can gain 
		experience.&nbsp; 2. So we can have a body and eventually have immortal 
		bodies, and 3. So we can have our own eternal families.&nbsp; God set up the 
		earth in such a manner that if we have good desires, if we are trying to 
		be unselfish and help people, we will be brought towards Him. The 
		scriptures tell us that everything testifies of Godâplants, stars, 
		oceansâeverything.&nbsp; (See Alma 30:44.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Letâs look at the big 
		picture.&nbsp; Think of the whole world and all the people in it over all 
		time.&nbsp; Most of you are returned missionaries.&nbsp; You have been preaching 
		the gospel and gathering those who would listen into the church.&nbsp; Those 
		who believe enter His church through the waters of baptism.&nbsp; 
		Statistically, not many people do that here.&nbsp; Just as everything in the 
		earth is to bring us to Christ, so everything in the church is to bring 
		us to the temple.&nbsp; Everything we do in the temple is to purify us and 
		prepare us to enter the Celestial Kingdom of God, with our families 
		sealed to us for eternity.&nbsp; It is in the temple where we gain the 
		ability to become part of Zion.&nbsp; It is there we learn how to become pure 
		in heart, to become more like our Savior by unselfishly serving others.&nbsp; 
		It is there our families are sealed forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Letâs review:&nbsp; We come 
		to earth through birth.&nbsp; Everything about the earth is organized to help 
		us believe in God and enter His church through baptism or a second 
		birth.&nbsp; Everything about the Church is to help prepare us to enter the 
		temple.&nbsp; Everything about the temple is to help prepare us to enter the 
		Celestial Kingdom of God.&nbsp; As we conform our lives to the template of 
		the temple, we will be able to return to God with our families.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The temple is the 
		essence of reality.&nbsp; It doesnât change.&nbsp; It has been the same from the 
		beginning of time.&nbsp; We have had temples on earth before.&nbsp; Today we have 
		more temples than ever, but there have been others and there have been 
		many worthy peopleâZion people.&nbsp; Think of Enoch and his people.&nbsp; The 
		city of Enoch, or the city of Zion, was translated in the process of 
		time.&nbsp; We become members of Zion in the process of time through many 
		visits to the temple and making many changes which mold our lives to the 
		eternal template of the temple.&nbsp; Yes, we learn to become part of Zion 
		through the temple.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I challenge all of us to 
		go to the temple more often and each time determine to make a specific 
		change as prompted by the Spirit.&nbsp; The temple gives us the basis upon 
		which to make changes to become more clean and pure.&nbsp; For example, we 
		can truly forgive someone for something they may have done to hurt us.&nbsp; 
		We can determine to not speak evil of others, including ourselves or our 
		spouses.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If we listen and obey, 
		the temple will help us achieve the power of purity needed to be part of 
		Zion.&nbsp; In the temple, prisoners are set free.&nbsp; Think of the bondage of 
		sin.&nbsp; Think of the bondage of pride.&nbsp; Think of the bondage of fear. 
		Think of being prisoners to lack of self confidence or uncertainty.&nbsp; 
		Through the temple, in the process of time, and by the grace of the 
		Savior, we can become free from these debilitating things.&nbsp; Go to the 
		temple and be set free and help set others free.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Can you go to the temple 
		too often?&nbsp; Not if you follow the promptings of the Spirit and go for 
		the right reasons.&nbsp; If we go to the temple only to escape from the world 
		or from our problems, we will not receive the full benefit of the 
		temple.&nbsp; If we go to the temple to prepare to meet our challenges in the 
		world with equanimity and faith, we will receive more of the intended 
		blessings.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Everyoneâs life 
		situation is different and changing.&nbsp; Some are students, some have young 
		families while others have moved to a different stage.&nbsp; Temple 
		attendance is really a matter of the soul.&nbsp; Anna who lived in the days 
		of the Savior was a widow of 84 years yet came to the temple daily.&nbsp; 
		When Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple, she was there and the 
		Holy Ghost let her know that this was the Savior.&nbsp; What a blessing for 
		her!&nbsp; Remember, we go to the temple primarily to follow the Savior and 
		do things for others they cannot do for themselves.&nbsp; The Savior did so 
		much for us that we could not do for ourselves that we should gratefully 
		do our little bit to help others.&nbsp; All aspects of our lives, including 
		our professions, are enhanced by temple attendance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the Doctrine &amp; 
		Covenants, the Lord explains some of the reasons He wants to give us 
		temples:&nbsp; âthat every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even 
		the Savior of the world; That faith also might increase in the earth; 
		That mine everlasting covenant might be establishedâ (D&amp; C 1: 21,22). 
		Where do men and women speak in the name of the Lord?&nbsp; We all know.&nbsp; 
		Yes, every worthy person should go to the temple as often as possible.&nbsp;
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">One of the great 
		promises of the temple is that of eternal families. Many people yearn to 
		have an eternal family but seem in this life not to be able to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maybe they lack the opportunity to be married or some other reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		For all of you who wonder, I promise that if you are patient and go to 
		the temple regularly, doing what is right and making the necessary 
		changes to meet the temple template, those blessings will come.&nbsp; 
		President Howard W. Hunter promised: âNo blessing, including that of 
		eternal marriage and an eternal family, will be denied to any worthy 
		individual.&nbsp; While it may take somewhat longerâperhaps even beyond this 
		mortal life for some to achieve this blessing it will not be deniedâ (<span class="zr"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">âThe 
		Church Is for All People,â <i>Ensign, </i>June 1989, 75). </font></span>
</span>&nbsp;The only qualification is worthinessâwe have to be worthy: 
		worthy to go to the temple and worthy in keeping our covenants.&nbsp; If we 
		are worthy, all these blessings will come!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There is an aura of 
		heavenly light that comes from the depths of eternity and enters the 
		temple.&nbsp; When we go to the temple, we absorb some of that light if we 
		are open, humble, and receptive.&nbsp; Thus, when we go forth from the temple 
		we possess a larger portion of light which, without compulsory means, 
		can be spread to all around us, especially to our own families.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The temple, through its 
		ordinances and teachings, becomes a great protection for us.&nbsp; We live in 
		the last days and some may wonder when the Lord is going to come.&nbsp; I 
		donât know exactly when, but I personally think the Lord will come when 
		enough good people have been to the temple, received their endowments, 
		had their families sealed, filled their lives with light and then filled 
		enough of the earth with that light that the world will be able to stay 
		in one piece when He does come with His brilliant light.&nbsp; Can you see 
		why the Lord has asked that we build temples all over the world?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The temple is the 
		template by which we measure our lives and receive the proper eternal 
		perspective to move into a Celestial existence.&nbsp; We must develop many 
		Christ-like qualities such as patience to be pure enough for Zion. Let 
		me relate an experience that Jean and I had over 20 years ago that shows 
		how the temple can help us develop patience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">âAfter the final 
		dedication session of the Tonga Temple, ordinance work began the next 
		day.&nbsp; The day was filled with miracles, great faith, hard work, long 
		hours, and much love and patience.&nbsp; We started early in the morning and 
		went late into the evening.&nbsp; There were many questions, much newness, 
		and great desire, especially on the part of the dozens of couples and 
		their families to be sealed.&nbsp; Jean and I, along with all of the temple 
		workers, were fully occupied every moment of the day.&nbsp; Taking time to 
		eat or rest was not feasible, nor was it in our thoughts.&nbsp; Regardless of 
		the physical strain on our bodies, during the glorious day we neither 
		hungered, thirsted, nor tired.&nbsp; The Lordâs spirit is the great healer 
		and the great peace giver in more ways than one.&nbsp; How grateful I was for 
		the skilled temple department staff who so kindly and efficiently guided 
		us through that remarkable time.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As we neared the end of 
		the day, I noticed that there were but two couples waiting to be 
		sealed.&nbsp; All the paperwork was supposedly in order, and soon they too 
		would receive the blessings they had patiently waited and prepared for.&nbsp; 
		We were confident that President Paletuâa and others would finish 
		properly, so Jean and I left to return to our room.&nbsp; As we went out 
		through the front door, a worker pointed to a group of seven young 
		children dressed in white whose broad smiles and longing eyes said 
		without words, âWhen is our turn?â&nbsp; We asked how long they had been 
		waiting.&nbsp; They explained that they had been there since early morning.&nbsp; 
		Their parents had entered the temple before breakfast and told them to 
		wait until they were called.&nbsp; (There was no childrenâs waiting room at 
		the time.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The older girls had 
		patiently cared for the others as they waited and waited and waited.&nbsp; 
		They had had nothing to eat, but did not complain.&nbsp; I asked who their 
		parents were and returned to the temple to check on what had happened.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There was now only one 
		couple left in the waiting area.&nbsp; I asked their nameâthey were the 
		parents of the children waiting outside.&nbsp; I asked how long they had been 
		there.&nbsp; âSince early this morning,â they replied.&nbsp; We handed in our 
		paperwork and were told to wait here until our names were called.â&nbsp; I 
		went to the recording area and asked about this couple.&nbsp; âSorry,â they 
		replied.&nbsp; âWe have no record of them as no paperwork has been 
		submitted.â&nbsp; Acting on a prompting I said, âLetâs check through all the 
		completed paperwork to make sure.â&nbsp; We began searching through the large 
		number of completed forms.&nbsp; Partway through, one set felt a little 
		thicker than the rest.&nbsp; We checked and, sure enough, attached to the 
		bottom were the missing forms!&nbsp; The couplesâ paperwork had not been 
		processed because it had accidentally been caught by a paper clip on the 
		forms above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Quickly we called the 
		couple and brought the children in, and shortly thereafter this precious 
		family was sealed for time and all eternity.&nbsp; As soon as the year-old 
		baby got near his mother, he grabbed onto her, determined never to let 
		go!&nbsp; With tear-filled eyes we all felt a desire to hold fast to our own 
		loved ones and never let goâgrateful for the saving ordinance and 
		sealing power in the holy temple of God that made such a thing possible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What joy, what gratitude 
		this family felt!&nbsp; Their waiting all day seemed nothing to them.&nbsp; The 
		only thing that mattered was that they were now an eternal family.&nbsp; They 
		had waited patiently on the Lord and realized his promise, âHow great 
		things thou hast prepared for him that waiteth for theeâ (Doctrine and 
		Covenants 133:45).&nbsp; What a lesson!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I wondered:&nbsp; Where else 
		do peopleâparents and childrenâwait patiently all day to be called and 
		told it is their turn, never complaining or even asking, just trusting 
		in the Lord and His servants, knowing that only when it is their turn 
		will they go, not before.&nbsp; I thought of how many other families are 
		waiting, waiting, waiting (on both sides of the veil), and realized 
		again how much more work there is to do.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yes, marvelous things 
		occur when we yield our hearts and minds to the Lord, especially in 
		connection with temple work.&nbsp; Eternally important changes are made in 
		the temple as we soften our hearts, determine to follow Godâs laws with 
		more fervor, and become more Christ-like in our nature.&nbsp; Temples bring 
		eternal blessing to everyone, everywhere across all eternity.&nbsp; Hearts 
		are softened, latent seeds of truth begin to sprout, prisoners are set 
		free, praises are sung with more harmony and meaning, connections 
		between here and there are more evident, families are sealed for 
		eternity, promises are made, and joy becomes a reality, now and 
		forever!â(pp.70-72, <u>Anytime, Anywhere</u>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, in the temple we 
		can learn patience (and we all need more patience) as well as every 
		other Christ-like quality needed to qualify for Zion. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As we go to the temple 
		our problems will not suddenly disappear but the solutions will become 
		more apparent.&nbsp; Itâs like a teeter-totter.&nbsp; If we go to the temple often 
		our problems will go down.&nbsp; If we go to the temple less, our problems 
		will go up.&nbsp; Itâs that simple.&nbsp; If we say we donât need to go to the 
		temple, it is tantamount to saying we donât need the purity that comes 
		from temple service.&nbsp; None of us are totally pure or fully in Zion yet.&nbsp; 
		I know that because we are still on earth.&nbsp; We need to go to the temple 
		regularly and in the process of time we will become pure and able to be 
		part of Zion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I testify that Joseph 
		Smith was and is the prophet of the Restoration in this the dispensation 
		of the fullness of times.&nbsp; The first vision is real, it actually 
		happened and its effect never ends.&nbsp; We have a prophet on the earth 
		today.&nbsp; I know President Hinckley is a true Prophet.&nbsp; Let me give one 
		example of how I know this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A few weeks ago, 
		President Hinckley called me at home and said, âWeâd like you to go to 
		Tonga with your wife to represent us at the funeral of the King who 
		recently passed away.â&nbsp; He gave me a few instructions and then he said, 
		âWhile youâre there, Iâd like you to give my love to the Queen and the 
		new King and please give my love to all the people in Tonga.â&nbsp; We did 
		our best.&nbsp; We met the new King and his widowed mother and many other 
		government leaders.&nbsp; We found it necessary to stay an extra day to get 
		everything done.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Near the end of the last 
		day, we received an urgent message asking if we could please come to the 
		National Television Studio for a live interview to be done in the Tongan 
		language.&nbsp; The interviewer had a list of questions, and when she 
		finished the list, she said, âWe have a few more minutes.&nbsp; Do you have 
		anything else you would like to say to the people of Tonga?â&nbsp; Suddenly, 
		it hit me.&nbsp; The prophet of God had asked me to give his love to all the 
		people in Tonga.&nbsp; I replied that indeed I did have something more to 
		say.&nbsp; I then told all the Tongans, âWe have a prophet on earth today and 
		he has sent me as his representative to give his love to all of you. If 
		you listen carefully you will sense that he is a prophet and you will 
		feel the Lordâs love through His prophet by his emissary.â&nbsp; I then 
		expressed that love using the wording in the higher or honorific form of 
		Tongan.&nbsp; Jean was watching the interviewer and noticed a few tears in 
		her eyes.&nbsp; I was of course, speaking directly into the camera, but I 
		felt that the people of Tonga were feeling and absorbing the Lordâs love 
		through His prophetâs love.&nbsp; I learned again that whatever the prophet 
		asks us to do, we can do.&nbsp; The prophet has asked us to attend the temple 
		more regularly.&nbsp; Letâs do it.&nbsp; I know we can.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I will conclude with an 
		additional testimony, after which we will listen to a song sung by the 
		Mormon Tabernacle Choir based on the 23<sup>rd</sup> Psalm.&nbsp; As you 
		listen to the song you will see a picture of the Savior connecting 
		heaven and earth with one hand in the heavens and the other on earth 
		touching the outline of your own Rexburg Temple.&nbsp; Let these truths sink 
		deep into your heart and determine to make the temple a bigger part of 
		your life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I know Jesus Christ 
		lives and loves us all.&nbsp; I know He is the Savior of all mankind and a 
		perfect, unselfish person.&nbsp; I know he has perfect love.&nbsp; I know that 
		through His perfect love he will with perfect mercy and perfect justice 
		render a perfect judgment for all of us.&nbsp; I know the temple is His house 
		and through Him, our way to the Celestial kingdom and eventual 
		perfection. I know the best way to be sure we will feel comfortable in 
		His presence in heaven is to learn to feel comfortable in His presence 
		in His house on earth. Temples are a bit of heaven on earth.&nbsp; I express 
		my deep confidence in you and leave my love and my blessings with each 
		one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<b><u>Joseph Smith</u></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Joseph Smith, a backwoods boy

		the woods to pray.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There, Joseph offered a 
		sincere prayer, begging the Lord for guidance.&nbsp; He had no intention to 
		found a new religion.&nbsp; It was not his motive to take on the great 
		religions of the world.&nbsp; He knelt and prayed and asked God which church 
		to join.&nbsp; Out of that anxious prayer came the restoration of the Lords 
		only true church!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Although the life of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And, his work continues on

		that Joseph Smith gave.&nbsp; Consider the 531 pages of the Book of Mormon, 
		the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants, and the translations in 
		the Pearl of Great Price and the Bible.&nbsp; All together, there are over 
		850 pages, which came through heart, mind and mouth of the Prophet 
		Joseph Smith.&nbsp; Eight hundred pages of scriptural text stand as a 
		monument to his name and testify that he is the prophet of the 
		restoration.&nbsp; Numerous attempts have been made to debunk, vilify or 
		dismiss these sacred scriptures but none has succeeded.&nbsp; </font></p>

		&nbsp;When you examine this churchs&nbsp; incredible history, the current inertia

		greatest of all decisions of mankind.&nbsp; Every hour of every day around 
		the world, faithful Saints are praying, working, testifying and giving 
		their all to build the restored Kingdom of God.&nbsp; This Church is not just

		was to remove himself so that the mobs would leave the Saints in peace.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a world where wickedness 		is more prevalent than at any other time in human history, God needs a 		powerful, covenant people to further his work for righteousness. The 		sacrifice you are making to gain an education will be of great benefit 		to you and also prepare you for greater service to Him if you remember 		that <i>To be learned is good, if [you] hearken unto the counsels of 		God.<sup><font size="1">2</font></sup></i> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Our Father in Heaven begins 		early to educate His children in the things of greatest importance. 		Essential Gospel truths are communicated so clearly in many of the 		Primary songs. They are simple enough for the smallest children in 		Primary to understand and profound enough to inspire the most mature 		gospel scholars.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">By way of example I will use 		the case of my 85-year old father.&nbsp; He has lived a long life of 		faithful, dedicated Church and family service. He also is very 		knowledgeable about Gospel matters.&nbsp; Today, besides serving as an 		ordinance worker in the temple, he serves as The Cookie Grandpa in his 		ward that has three Primary nurseries.&nbsp; When little children sing, I Am 		a Child of God, they are declaring certainties of which his 83 plus 		years of added experience bear witness.&nbsp; And as they belt out the words:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>I 		belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>I 		know who I am.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>I 		know Gods plan</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>		Ill follow Him in faith</i><sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">They can develop a great 		foundation to live a successful life and return to Gods presence.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">How blessed we are to belong 		to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and how remarkably 		successful our lives will be if we come to understand and act upon the 		doctrines of these three governing declarations:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I know who I am.&nbsp; I know 		Gods plan.&nbsp; Ill follow Him in faith.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Many spend their entire life 		in an elusive search for self worth. Often their quest takes them 		further away from the true source. Through gospel light, we know we are 		sons and daughters of a loving Father in Heaven with divine inherited 		attributes. Our worth is certain.&nbsp; We have had the opportunity to 		receive a physical body and throughout our lives, through the proper use 		of agency, subjugate it to our spirit. We shouted for joy when our 		Fathers Plan was presented because it would allow us to <i>gain 		earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize 		[our] divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.</i> <sup> <font size="1">3</font></sup><b> </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span class="huge">William 		Wordsworth beautifully expressed mortality when he penned the words:		</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span class="huge"><i></i></span><i>Our 			birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:<span style="font-size:7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>The Soul that rises 			with us, our life's Star,<span style="font-size:7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Hath had elsewhere 			its setting,<span style="font-size:7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>And cometh from afar:<span style="font-size:7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Not in entire 			forgetfulness,<span style="font-size:7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>And not in utter 			nakedness,<span style="font-size:
7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>But trailing clouds of 			glory do we come<span style="font-size:7.5pt">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoHeader"><font color="#000080"><i>From God, who is our 			home:</i> <sup><font size="1">4</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Similarly the French 		Philosopher, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, born 51 years after the Gospel 		was restored, but without the blessings of it in his life, exhibited 		remarkable understanding when he wrote<b>, <i></i></b><i>We are not 		human beings having a spiritual experience, but spiritual beings having 		a human experience.</i><b> </b><sup><font size="1">5</font></sup><b> </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We read in the Pearl of Great 		Price, Moses chapter 1, that after Moses had spent time in the presence 		of God who repeatedly affirmed his status as [His] son,<sup><font size="1">6</font></sup> 		Satans first frontal attack to diminish Moses self-worth was to call 		him son of man<sup><font size="1">7</font> </sup>thus emphasizing his 		fallen state.&nbsp; And so he does with each of us. There is power in knowing 		that we are sons and daughters of God and heirs of His kingdom. Sadly, 		many who know better are still searching for self-worth from worldly 		sources.&nbsp; They are then very vulnerable to unrighteous influences, and 		Satan delights.&nbsp; He would have an impotent people so that he can make us 		ineffective in fulfilling our earthly missions and ultimately <i>		captivate, to bring [us] down to hell, that he may reign over [us] in 		his own kingdom</i>.<sup><font size="1">8</font></sup> Years ago in a 		stake conference, Elder Loren C. Dunn warned, <i>If you live like the 		world, you will suffer like the world.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Satan didnt immediately 		leave Moses even with repeated stern rebukes to <i>depart</i> <sup> <font size="1">9</font></sup> and he wont leave us either until we, 		like Moses, have proven that <i>this one God only will I worship</i>.<sup><font size="1">10</font></sup> 		Until then he will continually appeal to our son of man or natural 		man tendencies to tempt us to devalue, diminish and belittle our own 		worth. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">King Benjamin taught that 		there are innumerable ways to sin.<sup><font size="1">11</font></sup> 		For reference, I have used the three temptations of the Savior as 		recorded in Matthew chapter 4 as a pattern of three types of mortal 		weakness that Satan preys upon in an attempt to captivate us.<sup><font size="1">12</font></sup> 		I refer to these as:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Passion,</b> an appeal to 		the bodily appetites.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Position</b>, a longing 		for the praise of, or power over, man.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Prosperity</b>, the desire 		for the treasures of the earth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Through the gift of agency we 		choose whether we yield to the natural man or rise to the divine within 		each of us as sons and daughters of God.&nbsp; We receive the blessings or 		consequences of our choices.&nbsp; Every righteous choice we make strengthens 		our spirit and ability to continue making right choices. Likewise when 		we fall prey to the enticements of the natural man, <i>that</i> pull 		becomes stronger.&nbsp; To use farm philosophy, we feed the cat we want to 		stay.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Passion may include such 		things as overindulgence in pursuing bodily appetites, entertaining 		immoral thoughts and behavior, or engaging in degrading or excessive 		recreation.&nbsp; These could lead to indolence, addictions, loss of virtue, 		and certainly self-loathing.&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Those who 		lack true self worth are at risk at finding comfort in things of the 		flesh.&nbsp; Addictions to food, pornography, or harmful substances are a 		poor substitute for the self-respect that discipline and a submission to 		Gods will brings.&nbsp; By overcoming the natural man, we will receive 		greater power, enjoyment, and feelings of self worth, and we will enjoy 		the blessing of the enabling power of the atonement.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0in"> <font color="#000080">Entertaining unrighteous thoughts whether through 		unwholesome fantasizing or pornography may create a chemical reaction in 		our bodies that will gradually but drastically alter the course of what 		we become.<sup><font size="1">13</font> </sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0in"> <font color="#000080">We get a sense of the seriousness of the very real 		affects of this as we read Elder Bruce R. McConkies definition of the 		Book of Life, in Mormon Doctrine:</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font color="#000080"><i>In a real though 		figurative sense, the book of life is the record of the acts of men as 		such record is written in their own bodies.&nbsp; It is the record engraven 		on the very bones, sinews, and flesh of the mortal body.&nbsp; That is, every 		thought, word, and deed has an affect on the human body; all these leave 		their marks, marks which can be read by Him who is Eternal as easily as 		the words in a book can be read.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><font color="#000080"><i>		By obedience to telestial law men obtain telestial bodies; terrestrial 		law leads to terrestrial bodies; and conformity to celestial law  		because this law includes the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost  		results in the creation of a body which is clean, pure, and spotless, a 		celestial body. (D&amp;C 88: 16-32.)&nbsp; When the book of life is opened in the 		day of judgment (Rev. 20:12-15), mens bodies will show what law they 		have lived.&nbsp; The great Judge will then read the record of the book of 		their lives; the account of their obedience or disobedience will be 		written in their bodies <sup><font size="1">14</font></sup></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Position<b></b> which is 		based on Pride and is only good enough if were better than others, 		includes seeking for power, status, fame, and the worlds approval for 		physical appearance.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As you look at people that 		you truly admire Im sure you will find, as I have, that you do not have 		to be famous to be great (and you certainly dont have to be great to be 		famous!).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One example of falling prey 		to our desire for position is seeking the worlds approval for physical 		appearance.&nbsp; It is almost comical how the worlds standard of 		handsome/beauty changes through the years. Today, an unrealistic 		expectation has been created to fit into a superficial mold. So much, 		that one supermodel said that in real life, without make up and lights, 		<i>even I dont look like [the supermodel Im portrayed to be</i>].<sup><font size="1">15</font> </sup><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;Often the body, as well as the 		spirit, is starved in a misguided attempt to gain recognition or 		approval.&nbsp; We now have extreme makeovers and fashion trends that would 		have us make a mockery of modesty and the sacredness of the human body.&nbsp;		</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Have you read the tag on some 		clothing articles that say something like the irregularities are meant 		to be here and are what gives it its value? Our differences are also 		meant to be, and are part of what gives us value.&nbsp; We show gratitude for 		the wonderful gift that our body is by proper diet, rest and exercise. 		Good grooming and modesty show respect for our body.&nbsp; Most importantly, 		there is a very real beauty that emanates from a righteous person.<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp; 		Id like to suggest that if we want an extreme makeover that will 		bring real self worth we will live our life to be worthy of having the 		Spirit as our companion.&nbsp; When Moses overcame Satan, we read in Moses 1: 		24 that he was filled with the Holy Ghost. These words from Parley P. 		Pratt show the power that we gain by living worthy of its companionship:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:left"> <font color="#000080"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The Holy Ghost 		quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands 		and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, 		by the gift of wisdom to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, 		cultivates, and matures all the fine-tuned sympathies, joys, tastes, 		kindred feelings and affections of our natures.&nbsp; It inspires virtue, 		kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity.&nbsp; It develops 		beauty of person, form and feature.&nbsp; It tends to health, vigor, 		animation, and social feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; It invigorates all the faculties of the 		physical and intellectual man.&nbsp; It strengthens and gives tone to the 		nerves.&nbsp; In short, it is, so it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the 		heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears and life to the whole 		being.</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span><sup> <font size="1">16</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When self worth is dependant 		on prosperity there is often a compromise in the things of eternal 		value.&nbsp; In a desperate attempt to obtain wealth some have resorted to 		dishonesty, others have put themselves into debt in the accumulation of 		possessions to give an appearance of prosperity. All too often families 		are given a lower priority as wealth is accumulated.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">My mother-in-law has often 		said, <i>Those who say money doesnt buy happiness just dont know 		where to shop!</i>&nbsp; It takes money to build temples, to go on missions, 		to raise a family, and many other good things.&nbsp; Its the love of money 		that leads to sin.&nbsp; The Book of Mormon continuously repeats the lesson 		that when prosperity leads to pride it inevitably leads to sin which 		leads to destruction.&nbsp; Ultimately it brought down both the Nephite and 		Jaredite nations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We cant sin enough, be 		famous enough, or be rich enough to increase our self-worth. It comes 		only from knowing who we really are and living accordingly. In the 		greatest discourse I know on pride, President Ezra Taft Benson said,		</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><font color="#000080">The Proud depend 		upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not.&nbsp; Their 		self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders 		of worldly successThey feel worthwhile as individuals if the numbers 		beneath them in achievement, talent, beauty, or intellect are large 		enough.&nbsp; Pride is ugly. It says, If you succeed, I am a failure.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>		If we love God, do His will, and fear His judgment more then mens, we 		will have self-esteem.<sup><font size="1">17</font></sup> </i></font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">What great contrast exists in 		the stated purposes of our Heavenly Father who declared to Moses:&nbsp; <i>		For behold, this is my work and glory - to bring to pass the 		immortality and eternal life of man</i>.<sup><font size="1">18</font></sup> 		And Satans, <i>for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like 		unto himself</i>.<sup><font size="1">19</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Plan of Salvation, also 		called the Plan of Happiness, is Gods charted course to take us back to 		Him.&nbsp; The all-encompassing Plan, including the Creation, the Fall, and 		the Atonement, make it possible <i>to progress toward perfection and 		ultimately realize [our] divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.</i> <sup><font size="1">3</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Because Satans plan was not 		accepted in our pre-mortal existence, his efforts are focused on 		undermining Gods Plan. After the <i>presence of God withdrew from 		Moses</i><sup><font size="1">20</font></sup> he realized that man, when 		left to himself, is nothing (see vs. 10) and even though he showed great 		strength in withstanding Satans encounters, vs. 20 says that after a 		particularly vicious attack <i>Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as 		he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell.&nbsp; Nevertheless, calling 		upon God, he received strength</i> Although we must exercise great 		discipline to overcome the temptations and trials that come to us, we 		must recognize that our strength comes from the Lord.&nbsp; Satan would have 		us believe that we need rely only on our own strength because without 		the strength of the Lord to sustain us, we are more susceptible to 		Satans power. The Lord told Moroni, as recorded in Ether 12:27, he 		gives men weakness that they may be humble. If we turn to the Lord in 		humility, He will give us strength to overcome all things. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When we submit our will to 		Gods and walk in humble obedience to His ways, we will discover a power 		unlike that of any worldly position.&nbsp; These words from Isaiah describe 		such ability. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their 		strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and 		not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.<sup><font size="1">23</font> </sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Nowhere is such humble 		obedience, and power needed today as it is in building strong families.&nbsp; 		Because the <i>Family is central to the creators plan for the eternal 		destiny of His children,<sup><font size="1">24</font></sup></i> it is 		no wonder that Satan has pulled all stops in an effort to destroy it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Growing trends which include: 		postponing marriage to pursue careers, cohabitation, gay and lesbian 		lifestyles, and divorce have all contributed to the current state of our 		nation in which a recent news story reported that single adult 		households now outnumber married adult households in the United States.<sup><font size="1">25</font></sup>&nbsp;		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Reports that the U.S. 		population reached 300 million on October 17, 2006<sup><font size="1">26</font></sup> 		gives added ammunition to those who feel it is irresponsible to bring 		children into an overpopulated world. Children, previously considered a 		burden by many are now considered a menace to society.&nbsp; Some feel that 		children are a threat to career, self-fulfillment, and/or personal 		appearance.&nbsp; Others delay having children until they have attained a 		predetermined financial portfolio.&nbsp; And even then, some abdicate their 		divine role as parents to day care.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In many homes eating meals 		together as a family has been exchanged for a fast-food-on-the-run 		lifestyle thus trading nutritional and psychological benefits for 		activities of far less value.&nbsp; One study showed that <i>kids who 		reported eating more family meals per week reported significantly less 		substance use and significantly better academic and mental health than 		those eating fewer meals with family.</i><sup><font size="1">27</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a quest for a higher 		quality of life, many actually trade it a mess of pottage, a cheap 		imitation. In the process they risk eternal life for themselves and 		their posterity.&nbsp; We can easily see how Satans focus of Passion, 		Position and Prosperity are a threat to the family.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Certainly we live in the time 		foretold by President Spencer W. Kimball 26 years ago when he said,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>		The time will come when only those who believe deeply and actively in 		the family will be able to preserve their families in the midst of the 		gathering evil around us.<sup><font size="1">28</font></sup></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Latter day prophets have made 		it clear that Gods standard set forth in the Garden of Eden has not 		changed.&nbsp; In light of the current U.S. trends I have just mentioned, 		consider these declarations from The Family: A Proclamation to the 		World: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><i>Marriage between a man 		and a woman is ordained of God; </i>and<i> Gods commandment for His 		children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.</i><sup><font size="1">29</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition, President 		Kimball reminded us that Gods standard for <i>complete chastity before 		marriage and total fidelity in marriage</i><sup><font size="1">30</font></sup> 		has remained unchanged throughout human history.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As Gods covenant people we 		must put families in the forefront of our priorities. President Hinckley 		has said, <i>The greatest measure of your success will be the quality 		of your marriage.<sup><font size="1">31</font></sup></i> If married, do 		all you can to improve the quality of your relationship; if you are not 		married, prepare yourself to be a good catch.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brethren, some single sisters 		on campus would like me to tell you that theyd like to date and not 		just hang out.&nbsp; If you need encouragement review Elder Dallin H. Oaks 		talk Dating versus Hanging Out.&nbsp; Dating does not need to be expensive 		but, he said, according to his 18-year old granddaughter, <i>A date 		needs to pass the test of three ps: (1) planned ahead, (2) paid for, 		and (3) paired off.</i> <sup><font size="1">32</font>&nbsp; </sup></font> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"> <font color="#000080">Ive heard more than one young man say, <i>Its 		so much easier when the girls do the asking and if I dont, they will.</i>&nbsp; 		I fear that the aggressiveness of some young women has made wimps out of 		the guys.&nbsp; Sisters, that is not honoring the priesthood!&nbsp; So three 		suggestions for you: A good potential date (meaning the person, not the 		event) needs to pass the test of the three bs (1) be patient, (2) be 		kind, and (3) be realistic in your expectations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brethren, if you are 		preparing for a mission, be assured that it is the single most important 		thing you can do right now to prepare for a good marriage because it 		will teach you, among other things, selfless service  a rare quality, 		but so essential for successful family life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In preparation for the 		responsibilities of life, President Hinckley has continuously told both 		the brethren and sisters how important it is to get a good education.&nbsp; 		Brethren, you need to prepare for a career that will support your family 		and allow your wife to fulfill her most important role as a full-time 		mother.&nbsp; Sisters, I hope you will never feel that your education is 		wasted when you choose to put motherhood over professional career.&nbsp; Let 		me give you five reasons why I believe education is so important 		regardless of the direction your life may take:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; Although it is the ideal for every 			woman to give full-time status to motherhood, there are challenges 			that force women into the workplace.&nbsp; The Proclamation says that <i>			disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate 			individual adaptation<sup><font size="1">33</font></sup></i> to the 			ideal.&nbsp; Education can then provide the opportunity for a mother to 			be with her children more than would otherwise be the case.&nbsp; For 			instance, if you are compelled to work to provide the necessities of 			life for your family, it would be much better to work 10 hours a 			week at $40.00 an hour than 40 hours a week at $10.00 an hour.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp; Education has much more value than 			merely preparing for a career.&nbsp; Knowledge brings freedom. It 			provides purpose, perspective, and a richness of life that makes the 			discipline required to study, and the financial sacrifice involved a 			small price to pay.&nbsp; Sister Camilla Kimball, wife of President 			Spencer W. Kimball said, <i>What we must be concerned with is 			preparation for life, and that preparation is continuing education. 			Whether it is to earn a living or to rear a family, men and women 			both need to have the knowledge that enhances their natural 			talents.</i> <sup><font size="1">34</font></sup></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp; Intelligence is one of the few 			things we can take with us after this life.<sup><font size="1">35</font></sup></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp; Education enriches our families. 			Sister Kimball further said, <i>The parents' aliveness to the world 			of ideas and art and science opens new vistas for children</i>.<sup><font size="1">36</font> </sup>&nbsp;Education trains us to think outside our own narrow 			parameters and there is nothing that will challenge your creative 			thought process like dealing with a determined two-year old, or a 			stubborn seven-year old, or a mixed up thirteen-year old.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; Education elevates your decision 			to postpone or interrupt a professional career until your children 			are raised becuase there is additional sacrifice.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Consistently making correct 		choices takes a lot of faith. As members of the church we each have a 		legacy of faith by those who have sacrificed much to prove that <i>this 		one God only will I worship.</i><sup><font size="1">10</font></sup> 		Many of you have personal family legacies.&nbsp; Let me share one of mine:		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Simon Baker, an early convert 		to the Church, remained faithful through much persecution and sacrifice 		as the saints were driven to the West.&nbsp; He was then called on several 		colonizing missions. One particular incident illustrates his character.		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>		During the spring of 1856 [he] was called to go and assist in the 		colonization of Carson City and valley.&nbsp; He had just completed a house 		on his lot at the corner of First North and West Temple streets [in Salt 		Lake City, Utah  approximately where the Conference Center now 		stands].&nbsp; Before starting on this mission, one of the leaders of the 		church came and said; Brother Baker, before going on this mission we 		want you to do something for us to help pay off the church debt.&nbsp; Simon 		replied, whatever is expected of me, I am willing to do.&nbsp; The request 		was: We want fifty head of your best cattle, and we also want you to 		turn over to the Perpetual Emigration Fund your house and lot. Simon 		did this, and with his wife and sons started on this mission</i>.<sup><font size="1">37</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;I thank my great-great 		grandfather for his unwavering devotion.&nbsp; If his faith had wavered and 		he had refused to give up such valuable property and assuming his estate 		were still intact and could have been sold, his descendents would now 		each have a mere few dollars. Instead, each of his posterity, now 		numbering in the thousands, has received a priceless legacy of faith.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This was the faith of Nephi 		who said, <i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 		for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of 		men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the 		thing which he commandeth them.</i><sup><font size="1">40</font> </sup>		And he records, <i>I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the 		things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth</i>.<sup><font size="1">41</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This was the faith of the 		King of the Lamanites, Lamonis father, who after seeing the example of 		Ammon and hearing the words of Aaron, prayed, <i>if there is a God, 		and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will 		give away all my sins to know thee</i><sup><font size="1">42</font></sup>&nbsp;		</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is the faith of the 		2,000 stripling warriors who went into battle saying, <i>behold our 		God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall</i><sup><font size="1">43</font></sup> 		Later, after horrendous battles, Helaman, their righteous leader, gave 		this account: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><font color="#000080"><i>and 		they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with 		exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them, 		and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers 		had taught themand to our great astonishment there was not one soul of 		them who did perish And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power 		of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been 		taught to believe  that there was a just god, and whosoever did not 		doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.&nbsp; Now this 		was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their 		minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually</i>.<sup><font size="1">44</font></sup> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is the faith of the 		young boy, Joseph Smith, who, recognizing that he lacked the wisdom to 		know which church was true, went into the grove of trees and knelt down 		to ask God which of them he should join. <sup><font size="1">45</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is the faith of many 		others recorded in the scriptures and evidenced in countless righteous 		lives today.&nbsp; And it is the faith that each of us need because we like 		the young boy Joseph often lack wisdom; like the 2,000 stripling 		warriors we are engaged in a battle, often the greatest being within the 		chambers of our own soul; like the King of the Lamanites we have sins, 		or mistakes and certainly weaknesses that we need to give up in order to 		know God; like Nephi we will be asked to do seemingly impossible tasks 		that can be accomplished neither by our wit nor our riches but only by 		the power of the Lord; like Job we will have many trials which exhaust 		our abilities and break our hearts, and like the widow of Zarephath&nbsp; we 		have need of great miracles in our lives.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This life will present many 		occasions to be tested to see if&nbsp; <i>whatever is asked of [us], we are 		willing to do</i>. It takes great faith to: </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; leave all that is comfortable and 			go on a mission</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp; stand for marriage and family 			values in a world of declining morality&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp; bring children in to this world or 			to accept the Lords will when we are denied having children</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">4.&nbsp; put covenant over comfort, 			convenience, and current craze to dress modestly and to wear the 			temple garment as instructed</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; pay tithing when we have little or 			no money and many pressing financial needs</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">6.&nbsp; accept callings and assignments 			that are beyond our own ability to fulfill</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">7.&nbsp; maintain peace in our lives when 			someone betrays us</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">8.&nbsp; hope for a better day when our 			bodies are ravaged with disease and pain</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">9.&nbsp; trust in Gods plan at the death 			of a loved one</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">10.&nbsp; trust that good and prevail over 			evil and that <i>all that was promised, the saints will be given</i><sup><font size="1">46</font></sup></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, the 		Lord needs a powerful people to carry on His work in these very wicked, 		frightening latter days.&nbsp; When we know who we are; know Gods plan and 		follow Him in faith, we will have His power that will bring security,<sup><font size="1">47</font></sup> 		strength,<sup><font size="1">48</font></sup> hope,<sup><font size="1">49</font></sup> 		and exaltation.<sup><font size="1">50</font></sup></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We meet today to formally break ground on two very 		important projectsthe expansion of the Manwaring Center and the 		construction of the new auditorium. &nbsp;These projects complete the 		founding of BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho.&nbsp; When viewed 		together with the construction of the temple, this is truly a 		significant time in the history of the university.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to reflect for just a moment on what 		these projects mean to us and what lies ahead of us as we carry them 		out. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin, lets turn to 2 Nephi, chapter 27, and 		read verses 20 and 23. &nbsp;In these passages about the coming forth of the 		Book of Mormon, the Lord teaches us powerful principles about how He 		works:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Then shall the Lord God say unto him 		[Joseph Smith]: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected 		them, and <b>I am able to do mine own work</b>; wherefore thou shalt 		read the words which I shall give unto thee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For behold, I am God; and I am a God of 		miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, 		today, and forever; and <b>I work not among the children of men save it 		be according to their faith.</b><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">1</font></span></span><b>&nbsp;		</b>(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, the hand of the Lord has been 		on these projects for a long time. &nbsp;He really is able to do His work, 		but He works according to our faith. &nbsp;We can see His work in the case of 		the location of the new auditorium. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This marvelous new building will sit on what I 		believe is the perfect place for it on this campusnext to the Hart, 		close to the academic core, and yet framed against the hill so that it 		fits well with the other buildings on campus. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How did it come to be that with all the 		construction of new buildings in the last few years this perfect site is 		still open and still available? Here is the story: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the Presidents Council considered the 		location for what are now the Hinckley and the Ricks Buildings, there 		was a good bit of lobbying and a lot of logic behind building both of 		those buildings on the field where the auditorium will stand.&nbsp; It made 		all the sense in the world to put those new academic buildings right in 		the academic core of the campus.&nbsp; But President Bednar and the other 		members of the Presidents Council were not settled in their minds.&nbsp; 		They decided to take a walk.&nbsp; As they looked at the field and visited 		sites up on the hill, the strong impression came that the new buildings 		should be built up on the south end of campus and that the field should 		be left empty.&nbsp; And so, long before the temple was announced, long 		before we knew anything about an auditorium, the hand of the Lord 		protected this site and extended the campus in the direction of what 		would be the Rexburg Temple. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We will need such guidance and such miracles in the 		months to come. &nbsp;The auditorium and the Manwaring Center addition are 		very complex projects.&nbsp; We have been directed by the Board to build them 		in a relatively short period of time.&nbsp; And we have been directed to 		build them within the approved budget. &nbsp;That means we must design and 		engineer the projects while we are building them.&nbsp; And we must build 		them together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To do all of this in the face of everything that is 		going on in the worldwith all the disruption and the potential for cost 		and delay that complex projects often entailwill require nothing short 		of miracles, and lots of them. &nbsp;Thus, we need to exercise great faith in 		the Lord Jesus Christ, that truly He might continue to work miracles 		among us. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have felt this need for miracles for some time.&nbsp; 		Let me share a personal note. &nbsp;Early one morning after the projects had 		been approved by the Board, I sat in my office pondering the challenge 		we face. &nbsp;I turned to the scriptures and came across this passage in 1 		Nephi, chapter 9, verses 5 and 6:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to 		make these plates for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">But the Lord knoweth all things from the 		beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works 		among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the 		fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is. Amen.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">2</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I read, I felt the sweet confirming power of the 		Spiritthis is the Lords work; His hand is over these projects. 		&nbsp;Skeptics might doubt our capacity to do all the Lord has laid out for 		us to do.&nbsp; Yet, we trust in Him and go to work.&nbsp; And that is what we are 		going to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, one last thought.&nbsp; As we exercise our faith 		and build these buildings under the Lords direction, we will have 		wonderful new facilities that will bless the lives of thousands. These 		buildings will stand forevermore as another great symbol of the hand of 		the Lord in this university and in our lives.&nbsp; The Lord has power to 		help us build buildings; but His much greater purpose is to help us 		build lives of faith, consecration, courage, and humility.&nbsp; While He 		will bless us with these wonderful structures, His far greater blessing 		is that we might gather together and live in Zion, that we might invite 		all to come unto Him. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I know this is the Lords work. &nbsp;He knows how to do 		His work. &nbsp;I pray that we will exercise our faith that He might work 		great miracles among usin these buildings, and in our lives. &nbsp;In the 		name of Jesus Christ, amen. </p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080"><b>Elder David A. 
		Bednar</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Brigham Young University<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho Devotional</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font size="2">October 31, 2006</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Sister Bednar and I are grateful to be 
		back on campus with you this afternoon. We love you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">My general authority colleagues who are 
		assigned to speak at BYUIdaho devotionals often ask me if I have any 
		advice for them as they prepare their messages. My answer is always the 
		same.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do not underestimate the students at 
			Brigham Young UniversityIdaho. Those young people will come to the 
			devotional eager to worship and to learn the basic doctrines of the 
			restored gospel. Those young men and women will come to the 
			devotional with their scriptures in hand and ready to use them. They 
			will come to the devotional prepared to seek learning by study and 
			also by faith. Treat and teach those young men and women as who they 
			really are.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
		This afternoon I will take my own advice. During the time Sister Bednar 
		and I served here in Rexburg, I often said from this pulpit that the 
		greatest compliment I could give you as students is to treat you and to 
		teach you as who you are spirit sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father 
		with a particular and important purpose to fulfill in these latter days. 
		I now plead and pray for the Holy Ghost to assist me and you as together 
		we discuss the spirit and purposes of gathering. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We are met together today to participate 
		in the groundbreaking for two buildings on this campusthe addition to 
		the Manwaring Center and the new auditorium. I recall with fondness July 
		1, 1997, my first official day on the job as the new president of Ricks 
		College. On that day we conducted a groundbreaking for the Spencer W. 
		Kimball Building. Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve 
		Apostles presided at that event. Now remember, it was July 1, and it was 
		my first day as the new president of the college. July 1it was windy; 
		it was very cold; and because of the inclement weather, we had to move 
		indoors into the west ballroom of the Manwaring Center. Later that same 
		day when I returned to the presidents home, I had to turn on the 
		furnace because it was so cold. It was the first of July in Rexburg, and 
		I had to turn on the heating system in our house. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I called Sister Bednar, who was in 
		Arkansas at the time preparing for the move to Idaho, and described the 
		historic events of the day. I also told her about how cold it was, and 
		that I had turned on the furnace. There was silence on the other end of 
		the phone. She simply said, David, it is the first of July. I 
		responded, Susan, I am in Rexburg. Such are my memories of my first 
		groundbreaking at BYUIdaho.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Our gathering today is an important 
		episode in the ongoing development of this Church sponsored institution 
		of higher education. During the last decade, one of the most important 
		educational events of the restoration has occurred in Rexburg, Idaho. 
		And the physical evidence of that marvelous miracle is found in the new 
		and renovated buildings across the BYUIdaho campus. In just the last 
		ten years the John Taylor, the Construction Management Lab, the Spencer 
		W. Kimball, the Jacob Spori, the Radio and Graphic Services, the Gordon 
		B. Hinckley, the university electrical sub-station, the Student Health 
		and Counseling Center, the University Village, and the Thomas E. Ricks 
		Buildings, were newly constructed. And the David O. McKay Library, the 
		Joseph Fielding Smith, Dorm 5, the heating plant, the John W. Hart, the 
		Mark Austin, the Ezra Taft Benson, the Thomas E. Ricks Gardens, the 
		George S. Romney, the John L. Clarke, the Eliza R. Snow, the BYUIdaho 
		Stadium, and other facilities which I will not take the time to mention, 
		have been renovated and remodeled. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Can you begin to sense the magnitude of 
		the miracleand how the hand of the Lord has enabled so much to be 
		accomplished in such a short period of time? And the most important 
		addition to the campus continues to rise majestically to the south of 
		the Gordon B. Hinckley Building. We all look forward to the completion 
		and dedication of the Rexburg Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The pace at and effectiveness with which 
		these projects have moved forward defies rational explanation. I am 
		personally grateful for the lessons I learned as these projects were 
		conceived, critiqued, modified, and executed. The planning for and 
		constructing of these new buildings and the remodeling of existing 
		facilities on this campus has required faith, inspiration, persistence, 
		and patience. I pay tribute to the good people on this campus who have 
		labored so diligently and valiantly to make this construction miracle at 
		BYUIdaho a reality</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The two buildings for which we break 
		ground today represent the final phase of a comprehensive campus 
		upgradethe last major elements in the physical infrastructure of 
		Brigham Young UniversityIdaho. These two projects are the largest and 
		most complex of all the projects that have been undertaken thus farin 
		terms of both size and cost. And because of their sheer scope, it would 
		be easy for us to miss the mark and think only in terms of the 
		temporal purposes and uses of these two buildings. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We would be wise to remember that all 
		things unto the Lord are spiritual, and not at any time have I given 
		unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of 
		men (D&amp;C 29:34). Interestingly, the renovated Manwaring Center and the 
		auditorium will share a common spiritual purpose; they will both be 
		primary places of gathering. The Manwaring Center truly will become a 
		center for student association and activity. And the new auditorium will 
		make it possible for the entire student body to attend together weekly 
		devotionals, will enable more family and friends to participate in 
		commencement and other significant events, and will meet a wide range of 
		additional needs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>The Principle of Gathering</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The gathering of scattered Israel is one 
		of the fundamental principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. 
		The Lord gathers his people when they accept him and keep His 
		commandments. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Tenth Article of Faith states: We 
		believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the 
		Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the 
		American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; 
		and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory 
		(Articles of Faith 1:10)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus on a grand and global scale, the 
		house of Israel is being gathered together in these latter days before 
		the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. This supernal spiritual 
		process variously is described in the scriptures as gathering out the 
		wheat from the tares (see D&amp;C 86:7), separating the righteous from the 
		wicked (see Alma 5:57), dividing the sheep from the goats (see Matthew 
		25:32-33), and assembling the outcasts of Israel and gathering together 
		the dispersed of Judah (see Isaiah 11:12). The spirit of gathering is an 
		integral part of the restoration of all things in this the dispensation 
		of the fullness of times. And as Elder Russell M. Nelson taught us in 
		our recent general conference, the elect of the Lord are being gathered 
		on both sides of the veil (see The Gathering of Scattered Israel, 
		Ensign, November 2006, 79).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Using the scriptures, we will now 
		briefly review several basic purposes of gathering, places of gathering, 
		and blessings of gathering. The order in which these items are presented 
		is not intended to reflect relative importance or priority.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>Purposes of Gathering</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">First, what are the fundamental purposes of gathering? The Lord gathers 
		His people to worship, to build up the Church, for a defense, and to 
		receive counsel and instruction.<br />
<br />
<i>Purpose #1. To worship</i><br />
		And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should 
		gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord 
		their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble 
		themselves together (Mosiah 18:25)<br />
<br />
<i>Purpose #2. To build up the Church</i><br />
		Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me 
		concerning all the churches, inasmuch as they are willing to be guided 
		in a right and proper way for their salvation<br />
<br />
		That the work of the gathering together of my saints may continue, that 
		I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of the 
		harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled (D&amp;C 101:63-64).<br />
<br />
<i>Purpose #3. For a defense</i><br />
		And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her 
		stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from 
		wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth 
		(D&amp;C 115: 6).<br />
<br />
<i>Purpose #4. To receive counsel and instruction</i><br />
		And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered 
		together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all 
		were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he 
		did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and 
		faith on the Lord (Mosiah 18:7).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>Places of Gathering</u><br />
<br />
		What are the primary places of gathering? The Lords people are gathered 
		into His restored Church, into holy temples, into stakes of Zion, and 
		into families.<br />
<br />
<i>Place #1. Into the Lords restored Church</i><br />
		That the work of the gathering together of my saints may continue, that 
		I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of 
		harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.<br />
<br />
		Therefore, I must gather together my people, according to the parable 
		of the wheat and the tares, that the wheat may be secured in the garners 
		to possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial glory, when I 
		shall come in the kingdom of my Father to reward every man according as 
		his work shall be (D&amp;C 101:64-65). <br />
<br />
<i>Place #2. Into holy temples</i><br />
		Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in 
		the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye 
		labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered 
		into the garners, that they are not wasted. <br />
<br />
		Please note that President Howard W. Hunter taught that the garners are 
		the holy temples (see Church News, 17 September 1994). This 
		interpretation by President Hunter adds additional clarity about the 
		importance of sacred temple covenants and ordinances, that the sheaves 
		are not wasted.<br />
<br />
		Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, 
		neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm 
		cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm 
		cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce 
		winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them (Alma 26:5-6).<br />
<br />
		The Prophet Joseph Smith declared that in all ages the divine purpose of 
		gathering is to build temples so that the Lords children can receive 
		the highest ordinances and thereby gain eternal life (see TPJS, pp. 
		307-308, 314).<br />
<br />
<i>Place #3. Into stakes of Zion</i><br />
		We ask thee to appoint unto Zion other stakes besides this one which 
		thou hast appointed, that the gathering of thy people may roll on in 
		great power and majesty, that thy work may be cut short in 
		righteousness (D&amp;C 109:59). <br />
<br />
<i>Place #4. Into families</i><br />
		And most significantly, by the power of the Melchizedek priesthood and 
		through the ordinances of the Holy Temple, we are gathered into families 
		that can endure beyond the grave.<br />
<br />
		And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched 
		their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting 
		of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their 
		daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being 
		separate one from another (Mosiah 2:5).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>Blessings of Gathering</u><br />
<br />
		Finally, what are the blessings of gathering? The gathering of the 
		Lords people brings blessings of edification, preservation, and 
		strength.<br />
<br />
<i>Blessing #1. Edification</i><br />
		For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the 
		edifying of the body of Christ:<br />
<br />
		Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the 
		Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the 
		fulness of Christ (Ephesians 4:12-13).<br />
<br />
<i>Blessing #2. Preservation</i><br />
		And the day shall come that the earth shall rest, but before that day 
		the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the 
		earth; and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth; and great 
		tribulations shall be among the children of men, but my people will I 
		preserve (Moses 7:61).<br />
<br />
<i>Blessing #3. Strength</i><br />
		For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be 
		enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, 
		Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments (D&amp;C 82:14).<br />
<br />
		These blessings associated with the spirit and purposes of gathering 
		will be increasingly evident throughout your life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>The Principle of Gathering at Brigham Young UniversityIdaho</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The spirit, purposes, and blessings of 
		gathering also occur in smaller but equally important ways on this set 
		apart and special campus. The power of righteous unity can pervade your 
		classrooms, your home evening groups, the weekly devotionals, among 
		students studying in the library, and in student wards and stakes. This 
		spirit of gathering brings assurance, encouragement, and a sense of 
		purpose greater than self. At BYUIdaho you gather to worship the Father 
		in the name of the Son, to build up the Church and the university, to 
		find defense and protection, and to receive counsel and instruction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You gather together to learn and to 
		prepare for your mortal and eternal opportunities and responsibilities. 
		You gather together to strengthen each other. You gather together to 
		develop appropriate relationships and to create eternal families. You 
		gather together to increase in understanding about the purpose and 
		measure of your creation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You are richly blessed to be students 
		gathered together on the campus of BYUIdaho. In September of 1997, 
		President James E. Faust, second counselor in the First Presidency, came 
		to this campus to dedicate the John Taylor Building. Elder Henry B. 
		Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Commissioner of 
		Church Education was President Fausts companion for that assignment.
		</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Elder Eyring arrived in Rexburg one day 
		early to review several university issues with me and to ensure that 
		everything was in order for President Faust. When I picked up Elder 
		Eyring at the airport, I learned that he had just returned from a 
		two-week assignment in South America. He obviously was tired from his 
		travels, and I was anxious to get him to our home so he could rest.
		</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As we drove to our home, I asked Elder 
		Eyring if he was interested in quickly walking through the completed 
		Taylor Building. He answered that he was interested, and we spent 
		approximately 15 minutes inspecting the classrooms and other facilities.
		</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Our last stop was the Taylor Chapel 
		where Elder Eyring stood near the pulpit on the stand and gazed into the 
		audience area for quite a long time. After a few minutes, I asked him: 
		Elder Eyring, what are you thinking about? He answered with this 
		profound and penetrating observation: I am thinking about how much we 
		do for so few and how little we do for so many. He then continued, The 
		tithing of the people I just visited in South America and from good 
		people all over the world paid for this facility. And most of the people 
		who have made this beautiful facility possible will never see or step 
		foot in a building like this. That is what I am thinking about. That 
		experience influenced me in an important way during the time I served 
		here at BYUIdaho. And now as a colleague of Elder Eyring in the Quorum 
		of the Twelve, I understand more completely what he meant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Sister Bednar and I returned last week 
		from an assignment in Slovakia and Hungary. The people with whom we met 
		in those countries will likely never see or step foot in the remodeled 
		Manwaring Center or the new auditorium. The Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints has invested millions of tithing dollars to upgrade 
		the BYUIdaho campus. These expenditures have been made to provide 
		associations and places wherein you can learn about, gain experience 
		with, and be blessed by the spirit of gathering. Please do not take 
		these sacred resources, your choice associations, and this beautiful 
		campus for granted. Please do not think that you are somehow more 
		deserving or worthy. Please do not allow yourself to get fussy and 
		grumpy because you do not have everything you believe you should 
		havesuch as a parking space within 200 feet of the building where you 
		work or where your next class is held. Please be grateful for the 
		singular opportunity you have to learn and work hereand for the 
		responsibility that rests upon you as one who has been the recipient of 
		great blessings. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>A Warning and A Promise</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the authority of the holy Apostleship, I now raise a voice of warning 
		and I make a solemn promise. If the day ever were to come that 
		intellectual arrogance, a lack of appreciation, and a spirit of 
		demanding entitlement take root on this campusamong the students, 
		the faculty, the employees, the administration, or within the community of Rexburgthen 
		in that day the Spirit of Ricks will be well on the way to being 
		extinguishedand the heavenly influence and blessings that have 
		prospered this institution and the people associated with it will be 
		withdrawn. Conversely, as long as intellectual modesty, humility, 
		gratitude, obedience, and frugality continue to characterize those who 
		learn and serve at Brigham Young UniversityIdaho, then this university will shine forth ever 
		brighter as a beacon of righteousness and of inspired educational 
		innovation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<u>My Witness</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I declare my special witness that Jesus is the Christ and that the 
		fullness of His gospel has been restored to the earth in these latter 
		days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know and witness that the 
		Savior lives. He stands at the head of His Church, and He directs its 
		affairs through revelation to a living prophet. I so witness in the 
		sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sister Oaks and I 		are thrilled to be with you and with President and Sister Clark here in 		Rexburg.&nbsp; We thank each of you for your presence here.&nbsp; This is a great 		and blessed place to pursue your education, and we feel privileged to 		try to contribute to that process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I have felt to speak 		to you about the scriptural direction that we should seek . . . wisdom 		(D&amp;C 6:7) or get wisdom (Proverbs 4:7) or learn wisdom (Mosiah 2:17; 		Alma 32:12; Alma 37:35).&nbsp; We are also taught that things should be done 		in wisdom and order (Mosiah 4:27).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Wisdom is defined as 		the quality of knowing what is true or right and knowing what to do 		about it.&nbsp; I do not speak of worldly wisdom, for as the apostle Paul 		wrote, The wisdom of the world is foolishness with God (1 Corinthians 		3:19).&nbsp; Paul advocated a special kind of wisdom when he told the Roman 		saints, I would have you <i>wise unto that which is good</i> (Romans 		16:19; emphasis added).&nbsp; That is wisdom in seeking and doing the will of 		God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The scriptures teach 		us that we can learn that kind of wisdom by humbling [ourselves] and 		calling upon the Lord . . . that [our] eyes may be opened that [we] may 		see, and [our] ears opened that [we] may hear (D&amp;C 136:32).&nbsp; We learn 		that kind of wisdom line upon line, precept upon precept, by harkening 		to the precepts of God and by lending an ear to His counsel (see 2 Nephi 		28:30).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I have chosen to 		apply this teaching about wisdom to about a dozen different subjects.&nbsp; I 		believe that some of these will have application to each person here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I begin with s<b>ome 		wise advice from our prophet.&nbsp; </b>In a talk given eight years ago, 		President Hinckley urged a group of BYU students to have more 		excellence in their studies.&nbsp; He asked for a little more 		self-discipline, a little more consecrated effort. . . .&nbsp; He continued:</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">This is the great day 		of preparation for each of you.&nbsp; It is the time of beginning for 		something that will go on for as long as you live.&nbsp; I plead with you:&nbsp; 		Dont be a scrub!&nbsp; Rise to the high ground of excellence.&nbsp; You can do 		it.&nbsp; You may not be a genius.&nbsp; You may be lacking in some skills.&nbsp; But 		you can do better than you are now doing.&nbsp; You are students at BYU.&nbsp; 		Most of you are members of this great Church whose influence is now felt 		all over the world.&nbsp; You are people with a present and with a future.&nbsp; 		Dont muff the ball.&nbsp; Be excellent.&nbsp; (Gordon B. Hinckley, Our Journey 		Together, an address at Brigham Young University, November 10, 1998.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After President 		Hinckley spoke those words to all students, he gave this advice to those 		who were married or anticipating marriage:</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I could wish for you 		nothing better than a good marriage, a happy marriage, a marriage 		fruitful in the sweet and satisfying things of life.&nbsp; Your marriage will 		not be excellent if it is marred with argument, if it is filled with 		disrespect one for another, if there is any lack of loyalty or devotion 		to one another.&nbsp; Cherish your spouse as the greatest possession of your 		life and treat him or her accordingly.&nbsp; Make it your constant goal to 		add to the happiness and comfort of your companion.&nbsp; (Ibid.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I feel to build upon 		that wonderful advice.&nbsp; Sometimes married persons think that when 		disagreements arise</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">as they will</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">that their goal should be to meet their companion half way.&nbsp; That is 		totally inadequate because one spouses perception of half way will 		always be different than the others.&nbsp; Be wise and understand that the 		only way to happy resolution of disagreements in marriage is for each 		companion to be willing to meet the other 90% of the way.&nbsp; Only by that 		approach can you be sure that your efforts will bridge the gap and bring 		you into harmony, hand-in-hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">My second subject of 		wisdom concerns <b>looking beyond the mark.&nbsp; </b>In the Book of Mormon 		the Prophet Jacob described a people who despised the words of 		plainness, . . . and sought for things . . . they could not understand 		(Jacob 4:14).&nbsp; He said this caused them to fall because when persons are 		looking beyond the mark, God takes away plainness and gives them what 		they sought</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">things they cannot understand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We see this today.&nbsp; 		For example, some persons write General Authorities asking when we will 		be returning to Missouri or how we should plan to build up the New 		Jerusalem.&nbsp; Others want to know details about the Celestial Kingdom, 		such as the position of a person who lives a good life but never ever 		marries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I dont know the 		answers to any of these questions.&nbsp; What I do know is that persons 		worrying about such things are probably neglecting to seek a firmer 		understanding and a better practice of the basic principles of the 		gospel that have been given to them with words of plainness by the 		scriptures and by the servants of the Lord&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">If we neglect the 		words of plainness and look beyond the mark, we are starting down a path 		that often leads to a loss of commitment and sometimes to a loss of 		faith.&nbsp; There is enough difficulty in following the words of plainness, 		without reaching out for things we have not been given and probably 		cannot understand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On our refrigerator 		at home Sister Oaks has posted these wise words of Sister Elisa Wirthlin:&nbsp; 		Dont complicate the simplicities of the gospel with questions that are 		not in harmony with simple truths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Prayer Language.&nbsp;		</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Be wise in your public 		prayers.&nbsp; Keep them short, and remember to give a prayer, not a speech.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Short prayers are in 		order in any public meeting.&nbsp; The Savior taught that we should not use 		vain repetitions like the heathen, who think that they shall be 		heard for their much speaking (3 Nephi 13:7).&nbsp; The Lord knows what 		things we need before we ask Him (see vs. 8).&nbsp; To avoid vain repetitions 		we should limit our public prayers to the unique circumstances of that 		meeting and the people in it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Also, remember not 		to accept an invitation to pray to the Lord and then twist that 		invitation into an opportunity to give a speech to the audience.&nbsp; I have 		seen this many times, especially at funerals.&nbsp; A person who wanted to 		give a talk was invited to give a prayer instead.&nbsp; So he brought his 		intended talk and gave it as a prayer.&nbsp; This is not appropriate.&nbsp; Talks 		are addressed to an audience; prayers are addressed to the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I had an experience 		with this many years ago when I was a young law professor at The 		University of Chicago Law School.&nbsp; A prominent university official had 		been invited to give a prayer at a large public occasion in the 		university chapel.&nbsp; He sought my advice on how he should begin the 		prayer.&nbsp; This man had given many public lectures, but, not being a 		minister, he had never given a public prayer.&nbsp; He asked me because he 		knew I had done this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">How do you begin a 		prayer? he asked.&nbsp; Oh, thats easy, I replied.&nbsp; You just say Our 		Father in Heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">His reply revealed 		his concerns.&nbsp; Why do you call him Father?&nbsp; How do you know God is 		male?&nbsp; Thats what it says in the Bible, I explained.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">That didnt satisfy 		him.&nbsp; Wont you offend some members of the audience if you address God 		as a male? he asked.&nbsp; That was my opportunity to speak about the 		principle I am suggesting to you.&nbsp; Oh, Edward, I replied.&nbsp; If you 		want to pray to God, you begin with Our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; If you are 		worried about speaking to the audience, then you begin the prayer with 		Ladies and Gentlemen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">You might be 		interested to know what he did with that advice.&nbsp; After he gave the 		prayer, he sent me a copy.&nbsp; I still have it in my files.&nbsp; His prayer 		begins, God our Father, Father of us all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">My advice has not 		always been followed.&nbsp; For example, a few months ago a young neighbor 		who is a returned missionary drew a tag to kill a moose in the mountains 		of Utah.&nbsp; Later, his father told me about the hunt.&nbsp; His son was 		successful in shooting a moose, and then phoned his father to come and 		help him drag out the huge animal.&nbsp; When the father finally got to the 		remote location, his son said, Of all the advice Elder Oaks has given, 		this is the advice I didnt follow and wish I had.&nbsp; He remembered my 		telling him, If youve got a moose tag, kill the moose near the road.&nbsp; 		My young neighbor had shot his moose over a mile from the road, 		downhill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Gospel teachers and 		Church leaders should <b>keep it simple.&nbsp; </b>President Hinckley has 		given us many examples of this wisdom.&nbsp; He is a genius at stating a 		principle or giving a challenge in such simple terms that it draws us 		all into increased understanding and more effective efforts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A few years ago he 		told us we should raise the bar for missionary service.&nbsp; He gave no 		complicated explanation.&nbsp; He just used that vivid metaphor to give a 		clear, simple challenge, and its impact has been felt by LDS teenagers, 		parents, teachers, and leaders everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Similarly, last year 		President Hinckley asked every member of the Church to read the Book of 		Mormon again before the end of the year.&nbsp; That simple challenge has 		probably changed more lives than any comparable teaching by any 		president of the Church within my personal memory.&nbsp; What he asked was 		easy to understand, and he gave a specific deadline.&nbsp; In doing so he 		directed each of us into an activity where we could benefit from the 		power of the scriptures and the witness of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Remarkably 		wise leadership!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I am reminded of 		Nephis words:&nbsp; And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring 		about great things (1 Nephi 16:29).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It would be wise for 		each of us to look for simple but powerful things we can do in our own 		lives and in the teaching of our children, family members, and 		associates in the Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">My mother did this 		over 50 years ago when I was leaving to go to law school in Chicago.&nbsp; I 		had been working in a radio station, routinely employed on the Sabbath.&nbsp; 		As I left for a new challenge in my life, she told me for the first time 		that in his graduate studies my father never studied on Sunday.&nbsp; He felt 		that he could do more in six days with the help of the Lord than he 		could do in seven days without it.&nbsp; He believed that by refraining from 		studying on the Sabbath</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">even in the difficult challenges of medical school far from home</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">he 		would receive the blessings of the Lord.&nbsp; It was a new time in my life, 		and that simple new challenge caused me to do the same.&nbsp; Study was my 		work, and the Lord had commanded us to labor for six days and rest on 		the seventh.&nbsp; I followed my mothers simple teaching about that 		commandment, and I was richly blessed for it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As our children were 		growing up, we had another simple practice that brought many blessings.&nbsp; 		We always turned the television off during mealtime.&nbsp; This forced us to 		have conversation without outside distraction.&nbsp; We had incalculable 		benefits from mealtime conversation.&nbsp; Parents grew closer to children 		and children to parents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Another simple 		practice many parents use is to remind teenagers as they leave on a 		date, Remember who you are.&nbsp; We always did that with our dating 		children, and I believe that last-minute reminder was a shield and 		protection for them.&nbsp; It had one unintended consequence, however.&nbsp; Many 		years later, after the death of my wife June, the time came for me to 		remarry.&nbsp; I was on my way to what you would call a date, if I had not 		been 67 years old.&nbsp; A daughter followed me to the door and with a 		twinkle in her eye said, Now, dad, remember who you are.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Be careful <b>how 		you characterize yourself</b>.&nbsp; Dont characterize or define yourself by 		some temporary quality.&nbsp; The only <i>single </i>quality that should 		characterize us is that we are a son or daughter of God.&nbsp; That fact 		transcends all other characteristics, including race, occupation, 		physical characteristics, honors, or even religious affiliation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Yet there are those 		among us who choose to define themselves by some other characteristic.&nbsp; 		It may be the fact that they are a patriot, a Cardinal fan, a person 		from Texas, a redhead, a great basketball player, or an underachiever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We have our agency, 		and we can choose any characteristic to define us.&nbsp; But we need to know 		that when we choose to define ourself or to present ourself by some 		characteristic that is temporary or trivial in eternal terms, we 		de-emphasize what is most important about us, and we overemphasize what 		is relatively unimportant.&nbsp; This can lead us down the wrong path and 		hinder our eternal progress.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">For example, a 		person who calls himself an underachiever tends to look for</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">or 		encourage others to look for</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">things 		that interpret his behavior in those terms.&nbsp; That has a very different 		consequence than if he and others looked on his quality of 		underachieving as simply a temporary tendency that needed to be 		disciplined in the course of seeking graduation, employment, or eternal 		life.&nbsp; Always remember that you are a son or daughter of Heavenly 		Parents, seeking to qualify for your eternal heirship under that 		parentage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As a positive 		example of self-characterization, I cite our daughter, Jenny Oaks 		Baker.&nbsp; As a nationally recognized violinist, she could easily identify 		and think of herself as a great violinist who is also the mother of 		three little girls.&nbsp; I am pleased that she does not do this.&nbsp; She thinks 		of herself as a mother who happens to be a violinist, and she orders her 		priorities in that way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Here is another 		subject of wisdom in seeking the will of God:<b> </b>&nbsp;<b>Hanging Out 		and Dating.&nbsp; </b>About a year and a half ago Kristen and I spoke to many 		single people in a CES broadcast from Oakland, California.&nbsp; In part of 		my talk I urged young people of marriageable age</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">especially young men</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">to cut back on hanging out and get busy with dating.&nbsp; I said:&nbsp; My 		single young friends, we counsel you to channel your associations with 		the opposite sex into dating patterns that have the potential to mature 		into marriage. . . . (Dating Versus Hanging Out, <i>Ensign, </i>June 		2006, p. 14).&nbsp; I told the men that to qualify as a date a meeting with a 		girl had to pass the test of the 3 Ps:&nbsp; planned ahead, paid for, and 		paired off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Dates involve 		commitment, if only for a few hours.&nbsp; But hanging out, as one BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho 		student wrote me, is just being idle in groups.&nbsp; No commitment in 		that.&nbsp; I urge each of you to experiment with commitments and to follow 		patterns that have the potential to lead to marriage.&nbsp; It isnt 		difficult to see the gospel significance of that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Those interested in 		an elaboration of that counsel can find the entire talk in the June 2006		<i>Ensign </i>or on the internet through lds.org.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Be Men.&nbsp; </span> </b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I was inspired and edified by the 		wisdom of the talk Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Presidency of the 		Seventy gave at the recent general priesthood meeting.&nbsp; He issued this 		challenge:&nbsp; We who hold the priesthood of God . . . must arise from the 		dust of self-indulgence and be men! (Let Us Be Men, <i>Ensign</i>, 		November 2006, p. 46).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Elder Christofferson 		shared many personal experiences and scriptural teachings on a major 		problem we feel in the world around us and even among the young men of 		the Church.&nbsp; Here are some of his words:</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The prophet Lehi pled 		with his rebellious sons, saying, Arise from the dust, my sons, <i>and 		be men</i> (2 Nephi 1:21; emphasis added).&nbsp; By age, Laman and Lemuel 		were men, but in terms of character and spiritual maturity they were 		still as children.&nbsp; They murmured and complained if asked to do anything 		hard.&nbsp; They didnt accept anyones authority to correct them.&nbsp; They 		didnt value spiritual things.&nbsp; They easily resorted to violence, and 		they were good at playing the victim.</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We see some of the 		same attitudes today.&nbsp; Some act as if a mans highest goal should be his 		own pleasure. . . . Dodging commitments is considered smart, but 		sacrificing for the good of others, naïve.&nbsp; For some, a life of work and 		achievement is optional. . . .</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We who hold the 		priesthood of God cannot afford to drift.&nbsp; We have work to do (see 		Moroni 9:6).&nbsp; We must arise from the dust of self-indulgence and be men! 		. . . . (Ibid.).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Elder Christofferson 		praised the quality of the young women of the Church, and then added:&nbsp; 		I ask myself, Do we have men to match these women?&nbsp; Are our young men 		developing into worthy companions that such women can look up to and 		respect? (Ibid, p. 47).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I would like to say 		more about this, but in the interest of time I simply endorse the 		importance of that message, and urge all of you to read it in the 		November <i>Ensign</i>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Be Women.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp; 		While I am telling the men to be men, I also want to tell the women to 		be women.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sisters, dont fall 		for the worldly urging that women should emulate men in various 		masculine characteristics.&nbsp; That is not what the Lord created you to 		do.&nbsp; Please dont misunderstand me.&nbsp; I am not saying that women should 		not be doctors or lawyers or any particular occupation that fits their 		circumstances.&nbsp; To use lawyering as an example, what I am saying is that 		women should not attempt to be <u>manly</u> lawyers.&nbsp; Nor should women 		emulate the worldly ways of womanhood.&nbsp; Your destiny is to be a wife and 		a mother in Zion, not a model and a streetwalker in Babylon.&nbsp; You should 		dress and act accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I quote Elder 		Jeffrey R. Holland, from the October General Conference one year ago.</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">First of all, I want 		you to be proud you are a woman.&nbsp; I want you to feel the reality of what 		that means, to know who you truly are.&nbsp; You are literally a spirit 		daughter of heavenly parents with a divine nature and an eternal 		destiny.&nbsp; That surpassing truth should be fixed deep in your soul and be 		fundamental to every decision you make. . . .&nbsp; (To Young Women, <i>		Ensign</i>, November 2005, p. 28).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There is wisdom!&nbsp; Be 		true to your identity and role in the Great Plan of Happiness, given to 		us by a Heavenly Father who created us male and female (Gen. 1:27; 		Moses 2:27).&nbsp; Our inspired Family Proclamation declares that Gender is 		an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal 		identity and purpose.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Elder Holland made a 		special appeal about how young women should dress for Church services 		and Sabbath worship:</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[F]rom ancient times 		to modern we have always been invited to present our best selves inside 		and out when entering the house of the Lord</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">and a dedicated LDS chapel is a house of the Lord.&nbsp; Our clothing or 		footwear need never be expensive, indeed should <i>not</i> be expensive, 		but neither should it appear that we are on our way to the beach.&nbsp; When 		we come to worship the God and Father of us all and to partake of the 		sacrament symbolizing the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we should be as 		comely and respectful, as dignified and appropriate as we can be 		(Ibid.).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -28.0pt; margin-left: 28.0pt"> <span style="font-size:12.0pt">You will find the entire talk in the 		November, 2005 <i>Ensign</i>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Gospel wisdom also 		dictates that you should refrain from resisting personal change by 		insisting <b>thats the way I am.&nbsp; </b>Dont create a barrier to 		progress by tying yourself to your past experiences or your present 		capabilities.&nbsp; Saying thats the way I am anchors you to the past or 		the present, and prevents personal progress.&nbsp; None of us is a finished 		product.&nbsp; The major message of the gospel is repentance, and repentance 		means change.&nbsp; Open the door to change in your own life.&nbsp; Look ahead and 		move on down the road toward better things in yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Now I move on by 		inviting Sister Oaks to move up to the pulpit for her message to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kristen M. Oaks:</span></b><span style="font-size:

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">It is so good to be here with my husband.&nbsp; We love BYU</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"></font></span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Idaho.&nbsp; Our grandson attended here, met his wife here, married here, and 		loved every minute of his time here.&nbsp; For many reasons this campus is 		especially precious to us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Elder Oaks has been 		sharing his wisdom with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Did you know there 		is a distinct difference in the dictionary definitions of wise and 		wisdom?&nbsp; To be wise is defined as judging properly as to what is true 		and right.&nbsp; Wisdom is the knowledge of what is true or right coupled 		with just judgment as to action.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When we use wisdom, 		we act and apply the information we know to be true.&nbsp; It is not enough 		for us to know the difference between right and wrong; we must choose 		right over wrong.&nbsp; Elder Bruce R. McConkie also admonished us that it is 		our obligation not only to believe, but to conform our lives to what we 		believe (Bruce R.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Always remember your 		identity:&nbsp; You are not mortal beings having spiritual experiences, but 		spiritual beings having mortal experiences.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It is very 		significant to me that the first words Elder Oaks taught in the 		Philippines, where he was sent to help establish the Church, were from 		Mosiah 10:4:&nbsp; Now if you believe these things, see that ye do them.&nbsp; 		That was a call to action.&nbsp; It is not enough to believe</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">even to believe with all our hearts.&nbsp; The Lord would have us act on our 		beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There is a promise 		connected to this scripture in the following verse:&nbsp; If we repent and 		remember the greatness of God, we shall always rejoice and be filled 		with the love of God, and always retain a remission of [our] sins and 		[we] shall grow in the . . . knowledge of that which is just and true (Mosiah 		4:11-12).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I want to testify of 		this in all aspects of my life.&nbsp; When I read the scriptures, the wise 		and pure words touch my soul and I know of their truth, and the more I 		read, the more I know for a surety.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Also, I know that 		when we practice the precepts we know we improve.&nbsp; When we first 		married, I was working as a consultant for a publishing house based in 		Boston</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I 		never cooked except once a year.&nbsp; Poor Elder Oaks.&nbsp; The first few months 		we were married I burned everything, even grilled cheese sandwiches.&nbsp; I 		knew very little about housework; I didnt even know how to match 		socks.&nbsp; Elder Oaks wears only two colors</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">black 		and blue.&nbsp; I called my married sister in tears and asked how to sort 		them and she told me to go stand by the window.&nbsp; That was wisdom!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It seems humorous 		now, but six years ago it wasnt so funny, and I felt totally 		inadequate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I learned to persist 		because I wanted my husband to live a healthy life.&nbsp; The scripture in 		D&amp;C 64:33 became a reality for me</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I 		just kept persisting:&nbsp; Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye 		are laying the foundation of a great work.&nbsp; And out of small things 		proceedeth that which is great.&nbsp; Last year for the first time I 		single-handedly cooked Thanksgiving dinner by myself.&nbsp; The Lord can and 		will strengthen us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Nephi also learned 		to be wise.&nbsp; He records that what was written on the Liahona, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;did 		give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord:&nbsp; and it was 		written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and 		diligence which we gave unto it.&nbsp; And thus we see that by small means 		the Lord can bring about great things (1 Nephi 16:29).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Brothers and 		Sisters, you are just beginning your lives as adults and none of you 		knows what lies ahead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I never dreamed when 		I sat where you are sitting that I would not marry until my 		mid-fifties.&nbsp; I had not prepared to support myself financially or 		emotionally or even spiritually.&nbsp; Living this gospel and making small 		correct choices helped me survive and progress.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I testify to you 		that if you seek to learn the wisdom the gospel offers your trials will 		be surmountable, your afflictions bearable, and your joys sweeter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">You are an 		exceptional generation.&nbsp; Remember who you are and apply the concepts you 		are being taught.&nbsp; If we listen to our Heavenly Father and try to be 		obedient and follow His commandments, the result of that obedience will 		manifest itself in our lives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I am so thankful to 		be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to have 		the knowledge of a Heavenly Father who loves me and cares personally 		about my life and my struggles and those of my family.&nbsp; I am thankful 		for my Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, for Joseph Smith and the Book 		of Mormon, and the power that the scriptures afford me.&nbsp; I am thankful 		for our living Prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, and for the Church leaders 		who surround him.&nbsp; I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Elder Dallin H. 		Oaks:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Thank you, Kristen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Handling 		Difficult Questions</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">.&nbsp; One of 		the wisdom lessons learned from President Gordon B. Hinckley is that 		when you are faced with a difficult question and you dont know the 		answer, be positive and tell what you do know.&nbsp; He provided some 		wonderful examples of that wisdom ten years ago in his interview with 		Mike Wallace on CBSs 60 Minutes.&nbsp; Here is my favorite.</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mike Wallace:&nbsp; There 		are those who say this is a gerontocracy; this is a Church run by old 		men.</span></p>
<p class="Style1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">President Hinckley:&nbsp; 		Isnt it wonderful?&nbsp; To have a man of maturity at the head, a man of 		judgment, who isnt blown about by every wind of doctrine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Another good example 		of a positive statement in response to a difficult question was 		experienced by Elder Angel Abrea.&nbsp; We had a missionary murdered on a 		street in Peru, a Peruvian Elder.&nbsp; Elder Abrea was sent to represent the 		leadership of the Church at the funeral.&nbsp; He called on the mother of the 		murdered missionary.&nbsp; She was a widow and this was her only son.&nbsp; In 		tears, she asked the agonized question, Why, Elder Abrea, why?&nbsp; He 		didnt know what to say, and stood silent, pondering why the only son of 		a widowed mother would be taken from her.&nbsp; Then the mother answered her 		own question with these words:&nbsp; Well, one thing I do know.&nbsp; I will see 		my son again, in the time of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When you are asked a 		difficult question, such as a puzzler about Church history or doctrine, 		be frank to say that you dont know.&nbsp; But then be sure to say what you 		do know:&nbsp; I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Finally, <b>All 		Things Must be Done in Wisdom and Order.</b>&nbsp; Sometimes we are just 		overwhelmed with all that we have to do, in school, in our Church 		callings, and in our other responsibilities, including our personal 		lives (where we need regular rest and at least a little recreation).&nbsp; 		Joseph Smith must have been overwhelmed in just that way when the Lord 		spoke these words to him about his work translating the Book of Mormon:&nbsp; 		Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means 		provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent unto the end (D&amp;C 		10:4).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The Lord inspired 		King Benjamin to teach his people that same principle about how they 		should follow another important commandment</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">¾</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">giving 		to the poor.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; And see that all these things are done in 		wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster 		than he has strength (Mosiah 4:27).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Some years ago Elder 		Neal A. Maxwell taught how we can be guided by this standard of wisdom 		and order and be comforted by the assurance that we are not required to 		run faster than we have strength (see Wisdom and Order, <i>Ensign, </i>		June 1994, p. 41).&nbsp; In describing how we can manage ourselves wisely 		he quoted Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who said, My life cannot implement in 		action the demands of all the people to whom my heart responds.&nbsp; Elder 		Maxwell taught that some choices are matters of preference, not 		principle, adding that wisdom and order [will] help us to separate 		preferences from principles (p. 43).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We are wise to 		conclude that we cant do it all and that we are not required to.&nbsp; When 		we feel overwhelmed with all that presses upon us, we should pray for 		inspiration to guide us in identifying what is <i>required by eternal 		principles.&nbsp; </i>These things command priority.&nbsp; We do them first.&nbsp; 		Then, in the time that remains, we pray for wisdom to exercise our 		preferences among those things that are <i>merely good but not 		essential.&nbsp; </i>Finally, when inspired wisdom has guided our choices, we 		proceed, as President Hinckley has taught us, to just do the very best 		[we] can.</span></p>

<p align="left">King Solomon, during a time of stress, sought from the 
		Lord an understanding heart. His request pleased the Lord. I Kings 
		3:9. I would ask that you would join me today in seeking the Spirit of 
		the Lord that each of us might have an understanding heart as we discuss 
		sacred matters. Clearly that extends beyond having an understanding 
		mind.<br />
<br />
		A tender letter came to me while I was serving in the Salt Lake Temple. 
		It was from a young man not many years older than most of you here 
		today. He was in a foreign prison. He indicated he could be there for a 
		long time. His purpose in writing was to ask that his name be included 
		in the prayers of the temple. At the end of his letter, at what seemed 
		almost an after thought, he asked, How did I lose my way?<br />
<br />
		I dont know the answer as to how this particular young man lost his 
		wayexactly when or where he drifted from the path to happiness, but now 
		in his sorrow, he recognizes his great loss. <br />
<br />
		This path to happinesswhich the scriptures call: &quot;the plan of 
		happiness,&quot; (Alma 42:16) &quot;the plan of redemption,&quot; (Jacob 1:2, Alma 
		12:25-26, 30, 32) &quot;the plan of salvation,&quot; (Alma 24:14; 42:5; Moses 
		6:62) &quot;the plan of mercy,&quot; (Alma 42:15) , &quot;the great plan of the Eternal 
		God.&quot; (Alma 34:9). and &quot;the merciful plan of the great Creator,&quot; (II 
		Nephi 9:6).<br />
<br />
		Each name emphasizes one aspect or another of the plan. In reality there 
		is only one plan called by many names through which God means to bring 
		to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. <br />
<br />
		Listen to the Lords words to Moses:<br />
		&quot;And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for 
		mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only 
		Begotten (Moses 1:33).<br />
		Note the Lord's words: <br />
		&quot;I created them for mine own purpose.&quot; <br />
		He explained a few verses later what His purpose was:<br />
		&quot;For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the 
		immortality and eternal life of man&quot; (Moses 1:39)<br />
<br />
		You are the reason he created worlds without numberyou and a multitude 
		of others. The fact that many are included does not diminish the glory 
		that awaits each one who obtains immortality and eternal life. The Lord 
		Jesus Christ accepted and adopted and put into force the Fathers plan 
		which was laid out to accomplish His purposes. <br />
<br />
		As the Father of us all created this earth to bring us eternal life, He 
		most certainly outlined a plan for us to accomplish the very purpose of 
		His creation.<br />
<br />
		Consider for a moment the importance of having a plan. Think of an 
		airplane leaving the airport with the complete journey mapped out. The 
		pilots and crew know where they are going, and they won't get off course 
		and fail to reach their destination once in 50,000 times unless weather 
		or mechanical troubles interfere. <br />
<br />
		Now, imagine another airplane with a captain and crew but no flight 
		plan. The engines are started, and the plane moves down the runway. As 
		it begins to climb, the crew doesn't know whether to turn east or to 
		turn west. If you are on that airplane, you will have almost no chance 
		of arriving at your destination. It is clear to each of us that an 
		airplane crew needs a flight plan. Isnt your future both here in 
		mortality and beyond the veil of death more important than a trip on an 
		airplane? Your Father has given you a plan. I might add it is also clear 
		that when a flight plan is ignored it is as if there was no flight plan 
		at all.<br />
<br />
		What is the Lords plan? There are some basic parts of the plan that we 
		ought to carefully study and ponder. Among them are:<br />
		 The premortal existence. You did not spring into existence when you 
		were born into mortality.<br />
		 Agency <br />
		 The war in heaven. <br />
		 The creation of the earth.<br />
		 The fall of Adam and Eve.<br />
		 The senior of them all--The Atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus 
		Christ.<br />
		 The priesthood and the keys thereof.<br />
		 Life beyond this mortal existence including a day of judgment.<br />
<br />
		The Lord tries to help us understand the plan first, and when we do, we 
		can then understand more clearly the ordinances, the covenants and the 
		commandments. We are first taught in the temple about the creation of 
		the earth and its purposes, then we make sacred covenants with the Lord.
		<br />
<br />
		Alma taught this principle when he said:<br />
		&quot;Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto 
		them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty 
		thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to 
		things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption 
		could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, 
		according to the supreme goodness of God&quot; (Alma 12:32 emphasis added).<br />
<br />
		Commandments are best understood after one knows something about the 
		plan. The Lord has given us instructions and commandments to help us 
		fulfill the destiny which He envisions for us. <br />
<br />
		When you are confused or distressed about the revelations from the Lord, 
		ponder His plan of happiness. When the covenants of the Lord which you 
		have taken seem restrictive or old fashioned, prayerfully ponder the 
		Lords plan. When the living prophets give counsel which you find 
		contrary to your desires or your opinions, prayerfully ponder the Lords 
		plan. When your course of action is inappropriate and the commandments 
		conflict with your wants, stop! Before you proceed, pray and ponder the 
		merciful plan of the great Creator. Doing so will help keep you anchored 
		against the winds of wickedness. Such action by my young imprisoned 
		friend would very likely have caused him to take a different course. <br />
<br />
<b>Temptations divert us:</b> <br />
		Just a few weeks ago the Deseret Morning News Church section had an 
		editorial which said:<br />
		This is an amazing age. Prophets in previous dispensations, privileged 
		to peer into it, described it variously as both magnificent, and 
		unprecedented in its wickedness. The Savior described it by comparing it 
		to another age of wickedness. But as the days of Noah were, so shall 
		also the coming of the Son of man be (Matthew 24:37). (Church News 
		August 2006)<br />
<br />
		What were the days of Noah like? The book of Genesis lists two major and 
		tragic accusations.<br />
<br />
		First: And God saw that the wickedness of man had become great in the 
		earth; and every man was lifted up in the imagination of the thoughts of 
		his heart; being only evil continually. ( Genesis 6:5.)<br />
<br />
		And the second: The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth 
		was filled with violence. ( Genesis 6:11.)<br />
<br />
		Is it not true that much of our public communication today shows that 
		the thoughts of many are evil continually? Surely the level of violence 
		in the earth is shocking and continues to increase. <br />
<br />
		Where do you find false and destructive concepts and principles? Where 
		do you find temptations to commit evil acts?<br />
<br />
		Everywhere, including printed material of all kinds, television, the 
		internet, videos, music, even misguided friends I do not need to list 
		them; you are not childrenyou know when material is going into your 
		mind that is destructive. You know when a sense of darkness comes over 
		you while reading and watching and thinking of inappropriate matters. I 
		warn you that time will prove to you that evil thoughts are more 
		permanent and more destructive than you now likely realize.<br />
<br />
		These evilsboth blatant and subtlesurround us and tempt us to divert 
		from our Fathers plan of true and everlasting happiness. By contrast, 
		Satans plan is a deceitful mirage pretending to bring 
		happinessoffering temporary fun and popularity. <br />
<br />
		President Spencer W. Kimball warned:<br />
		Whoever said that sin was not fun? Whoever claimed Lucifer was not 
		handsome, persuasive, easy, friendly? Whoever said that sin was 
		unattractive, undesirable, or nauseating in its acceptance? <br />
		Transgression wears elegant gowns and sparkling apparel. It is highly 
		perfumed, has attractive features, a soft voice. It is found in educated 
		circles and sophisticated groups. It provides sweet and comfortable 
		luxuries. Sin is easy and has a big company of bed fellows. It promises 
		immunity from restrictions, [and gives] temporary freedoms. It can 
		momentarily satisfy hunger, thirst, desire, urges, passions, wants, 
		without immediately paying the price. But, it begins tiny and grows to 
		monumental proportions. It grows drop by drop, inch by inch (CR, April 
		1967, p. 66).<br />
<br />
		Pursuing the vain things of the world, pride, unchastity, 
		misunderstanding gender roles, greed, and a disregard for the sacredness 
		of human life are just a few of the imprisoning obstacles to obtaining 
		life with our Heavenly Father. His plan allows for repentance, but it 
		does not allow for the acceptance and perpetuation of self-destructive 
		behavior.<br />
<br />
		Permit me to raise a warning voice about another potential path to evil. 
		Do not accept the philosophies of men about spiritual matters. Let the 
		standard of judgment always be the scriptures and the words of the 
		living prophets. This standard will not fail you.<br />
<br />
		Many who design the philosophies of men know little or nothing of the 
		purposes of God. Their secular concepts are often woefully inadequate 
		for eternal purposes. If, for instance, a person believes that man's 
		existence on earth is an accident of naturethat persons judgment of 
		the destiny of man will be flawed. Modern-day philosophers, in the main, 
		do not know about the premortal life of mankind, nor are they aware of 
		the eternal destiny of man. How could they possibly develop and teach 
		principles that will endure the tests of centuries? Knowing Gods plan 
		of salvation for you gives you a perspective of eternity unknown to even 
		the best educated of those who are unaware of that plan <br />
<br />
		When you make decisions that you know are contrary to the covenants you 
		have taken, when you choose to walk paths that lead you away from the 
		marvelous destiny that has been laid out for your life, stop and know 
		that you cannot fulfill your destiny through disobedience to His plan.<br />
<br />
<b>The Saviors atonement:</b><br />
		The center of the plan is the Lord Jesus Christ. Reject Him or ignore 
		Him, and the great plan of happiness cannot function in your behalf. His 
		life was dedicated in His premortal existence, through mortality, and on 
		into the eternal worlds to establishing the Father's plan to our 
		blessing and benefit. <br />
<br />
		The cost to the Master was monumental. Think of the pain of Gethsemane 
		and of His suffering on Calvary. This should give us some concept of the 
		enormous importance of the plan of redemption. <br />
<br />
		Let us read together some of His words which describe what the cost was 
		to Him so that we might enjoy the fruits of the sacred plan of 
		happiness.<br />
<br />
		Therefore I command you to repentrepent, lest I smite you by the rod 
		of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be 
		sorehow sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to 
		bear you know not.<br />
		For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might 
		not suffer if they would repent;<br />
		But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;<br />
		Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble 
		because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and 
		spiritand would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink<br />
		Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my 
		preparations unto the children of men (Doctrine and Covenants 
		19:15-19).<br />
<br />
		That description of His sacrifice falls short by a large measure of what 
		the true cost was; nevertheless, He partook and finished His 
		preparations for you.<br />
<br />
		Let me share two experiences that illustrate how the Masters sacrifice 
		and the knowledge of the merciful plan of our Heavenly Father helped 
		Latter-day Saints cope with great sorrow:<br />
<br />
		We were attending Sunday meetings at a black branch outside of Cape Town 
		South Africa. I invited several members to bear testimony. One of them 
		was a lovely middle aged sister who told of the death of her husband a 
		year earlier in an automobile accident. She expressed her gratitude for 
		the sealing powers of the priesthood. <br />
<br />
		A few days later we met with all of the missionaries in the Johannesburg 
		South Africa mission. I invited about eight missionaries to speak. As 
		one elder was talking it became clear that he was the son of the sister 
		in the small branch near Cape Town. After the meeting I told him how 
		impressed I was with his mother and then said: &quot;I am sorry you have lost 
		your father&quot;. He responded: &quot;I have not lost my father for I am sealed 
		to him. He is mine and I am his forever. <br />
<br />
		A similar incident shows the gospels comforting power:<br />
<br />
		Many years ago our family was at an outing with some very dear friends. 
		One of their children had an accident and drowned. It was a dark and 
		fearsome day. The following morning Sister Porter and I drove to their 
		home. As we approached the front door, a gentleman came out of the house 
		who was a close business associate of mine. He was very emotional and 
		all he could bring himself to say was: Death does not hurt Mormon 
		mothers like it does other people. <br />
<br />
		Of course the pain to any mother is beyond description. This mother 
		understood the planwhat is more, she had lived her life according to 
		the covenantstherefore an assurance had come through the Holy Spirit 
		that her child was bound to her forever. There came the sweet conviction 
		borne by that Holy Spirit that she and her child will meet again. My 
		business friend saw and felt what he could not understand.<br />
<br />
<b>Our moral agency</b><br />
		A very important part of Gods plan for you is your right of personal 
		choice. The Lord calls it agency or moral agency. That means you have 
		the right to make your own choices, but you then must accept the 
		consequences of those decisions! Whether we accept or reject His plan 
		consequences will follow. Truly, we have the agency to make our own 
		decisions, but many complain that life is not just, or the Lord does not 
		love us when the consequences of our choices bring pain and suffering.
		<br />
<br />
		The Lord has, through the scriptures and through living prophets, taught 
		us and warned us. Your parents, priesthood and auxiliary leaders have 
		taught and warned you. The truly outstanding administration, faculty, 
		and staff of this university exist to teach you, among other things, the 
		Lords plan for you as well as the consequences of not following that 
		plan. <br />
<br />
		You surely will not commit a crime that will cause you to serve a long 
		prison sentence. But many seemingly small decisions often have very 
		large consequences. <br />
<br />
		To illustrate how even minor acts can lead to destructive results A 
		survey by Rand Corporation in Pittsburgh published in Pediatrics 
		concluded that teenagers who listen to a lot of raunchy music with 
		suggestive lyrics end up behaving immorally. They tend to engage in the 
		types of things the music glorifies (Deseret Morning News Church 
		Section 19 August 2006).<br />
		Is that a surprise? We dont need a survey to know that we become what 
		we think about. The scriptures as well as common sense tells us: For as 
		he thinketh in his heart, so is he (Proverbs 23:7). What people take 
		into their minds will early or late impact their actions. Surely the 
		violence of evil begins in the thoughts of our hearts.<br />
<br />
		Do you see why pornography is such a curse? It is but one more addiction 
		to violence and evil. Those addicted testify that the thoughts of the 
		heart become evil continually.<br />
<br />
		The God given right of agencythe right to choose is often seen as 
		freedom to do what we want. Do we consider that the right to choose also 
		includes deciding to do what we ought to doeven if we dont want to do 
		it. The hard choices, the difficult choices even the ones that bring 
		some pain fall under the category of moral agency. <br />
<br />
		Individual progress is almost always dependent upon choosing to take 
		action that is difficult and sometimes distasteful. Progress is not 
		always related to talent or to high ACT scores or to athletic or musical 
		abilities. Personal progress is more highly correlated to your ability 
		to exercise self control and discipline: to arise early even when you 
		dont want to, to serious study and concentration when you would prefer 
		to do little or nothing, to happily abide the elements of the honor code 
		because you have agreed that you would do so, to cease doing those 
		things which the prophets have clearly indicated will bring us pain and 
		sorrow. Spiritual progress as envisioned in the Lords plan of happiness 
		requires us to deny ourselves. The power to say No! to ourselves and 
		then to abide by that decision which will bring major spiritual 
		progress. The power to say Yes! to the right choices and then see them 
		through to completion will bring major spiritual progress.<br />
<br />
		What should you do with the life God has given you? Where should your 
		contributions to others begin and end? An understanding of the plan of 
		redemption will bring these decisions into focus.<br />
<br />
<b>Using prayer and study to understand and live the plan:</b><br />
		Where do you learn about the plan? The answers are plain and powerful. 
		They include:<br />
		 personal communication with the Lord through his Holy Spirit<br />
		 the scriptures<br />
		 the counsel of the living prophets<br />
		 your patriarchal blessing<br />
<br />
		I have a worrisome suspicionthat far too many of our youth today do not 
		pray. Do you sincerely pray? In addition to your family prayers or 
		roommate prayers and prayers at meal timedo you have a time each day 
		for a personal and private devotional? Do you pour out the feelings of 
		your heart to your Father in Heaven and then when finished do you pause 
		for a moment of gratitude that He is there? I promise you comfort and 
		strength and understanding through sincere prayer. <br />
<br />
		In regard to prophetic counsel President Gordon B. Hinckley announced 
		the proclamation on the family, by saying: &quot;With so much of sophistry 
		that is passed off as truth, with so much of deception concerning 
		standards and values, with so much of allurement and enticement to take 
		on the slow stain of the world, we have felt to warn and forewarn. In 
		furtherance of this we of the First Presidency and the Council of the 
		Twelve Apostles now issue a proclamation to the Church and to the world 
		as a declaration and reaffirmation of standards, doctrines, and 
		practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and 
		revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history&quot; 
		(&quot;Stand Strong against the Wiles of the World,&quot; ENSIGN, Nov. 1995, 100).<br />
<br />
		Ponder the words of the proclamation on the family and you will find its 
		essence flows from the Lords plan of happiness. <br />
		Ponder very carefully any statement or proclamation when it is authored 
		and dispensed by the Council of the First Presidency and the Council of 
		the Twelve Apostles. You will most certainly be receiving the 
		instruction approved by your Father in Heaven.<br />
<br />
		One hundred and one years ago President Joseph F. Smith, then the 
		President of the Church, said: Those things which we call 
		extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may make history, but they do not 
		make life. After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be 
		the common lot of all mankind, is the truest greatness. To be a 
		successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a 
		successful general or a successful statesmen (Juvenile Instructor 15 
		December 1905 p. 752).<br />
<br />
		That statement may seem contrary to your understanding of the importance 
		of generals and statesmen. But it was given us by a prophet of God who 
		understood the Lords plan of salvation. He was able to see far into the 
		future when the successful father and the successful mothers work will 
		deliver results that cannot be totally understood during ones mortal 
		life. <br />
<br />
		Seek diligently to understand the plan of the Father. It is simple. It 
		is challenging. A child can learn its fundamentals. Yet, the brightest 
		spiritually among us can profitably invest a good part of life seeking 
		to understand Gods principles of progress.<br />
<br />
		Men are that they might have joy said the prophet Lehi many years ago 
		(II Nephi 2:25). Remember that there is an order and a cost to obtaining 
		that joy. Gods plan requires personal vision, sacrifice, and yes, 
		discipline. Yet the plan, abided by, brings joy and comfort and peace 
		and long lasting happiness. The great plan of the Eternal God exists to 
		prepare you and me to live comfortably in a celestial world where 
		celestial law reigns.<br />
<br />
		Commit yourself now to the work of the Lord and His plan here on the 
		earth. It will require a good deal of inconvenience and selflessness and 
		sacrifice but will give you the ... the peace of God, which passeth all 
		understanding,... (Philippians 4:7). You will be a recipient of 
		immortality and eternal lifethe very purpose for this earths creation.<br />
<br />
		In soberness and in all solemnity I bear witness to you that there is a 
		God in Heaven who is the Father of us all. I stand as a witness of the 
		Lord Jesus Christ and of His atoning sacrifice for us. I know that we 
		are led by prophets of God the senior among them being President Gordon 
		B. Hinckley</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, it is an honor and a 
		privilege to address you this afternoon and as I do so I feel a great 
		sense of responsibility.&nbsp; I have sought the Lord in prayer to know what 
		I might say and hope that you came today with a prayer in your hearts 
		that we all might be edified together (D&amp;C 50:22) and taught by the Holy 
		Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On a warm Northern California summer afternoon 
		several years ago, my wife and I were on our way to speak at a youth 
		conference when we had a most interesting experience.&nbsp; With the day 
		being warm and the drive being long we decided to stop for gas and 
		something to drink.&nbsp; Walking in to the convenience store to pay for our 
		purchases we noticed two well-dressed women talking to the store clerk.&nbsp; 
		They were clearly upset and were asking for driving directions â 
		something a man, of course, would never do!&nbsp; We learned they were late 
		for a wedding, and at this point, had no idea how to get to their 
		desired location.&nbsp; They had a map and they were showing it to the 
		clerk.&nbsp; He clearly did not know how to help them, and the women were 
		obviously frustrated at not getting the information they were looking 
		for.&nbsp; I decided to offer my help.&nbsp; I took one look at their map and 
		immediately knew what the problem was.&nbsp; The map had been drawn upside 
		down, with âsouthâ at the top and ânorthâ at the bottom.&nbsp; Let me 
		describe just how lost they wereâ¦I will use cities you might be a bit 
		more familiar with.&nbsp; Assume they had left from Rexburg, with Pocatello 
		as their desired destination.&nbsp; They finally stopped to ask for 
		directions when they saw a sign that read, âWelcome to the City of West 
		Yellowstone.â&nbsp; After turning the map right-side-up, pointing them in the 
		correct direction and getting them back on the freeway, our hope has 
		continued to be that they finally got to the wedding.&nbsp; We have also 
		wondered how many other people, using the same map, are still driving 
		around the freeways of Northern California looking for the same wedding!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have reflected on this experience many times and 
		the predicament these women found themselves in.&nbsp; They followed the 
		directions they had been given with exactness.&nbsp; I assume they had 
		observed posted speed limits.&nbsp; They carefully avoided accidents, and 
		anxiously read the exit signs desperately hoping to find something 
		familiar.&nbsp; But in the end they were hopelessly lost and had they not 
		stopped to get true and correct directions, they never would have 
		arrived at their intended destination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clearly, in the confusing and turbulent world we 
		live in today, sure and true directions are essential in our journey 
		through life if we are to arrive at our desired destination.&nbsp; As we read 
		and ponder the scriptures, as we listen to the words of living prophets 
		in General Conference, as we read their words in the <i>Ensign</i> and
		<i>Church News</i>, as General Authorities, university leaders, and 
		others teach us on this campus, as we are taught by our priesthood 
		leaders, and most importantly when I am taught by the Holy Ghost, I am 
		reminded that a loving Father in Heaven provides for each of us clear, 
		sure and true directions.&nbsp; He has given us a map that, when followed 
		with faith and obedient exactness, will lead us back to His presence to 
		live with him, his Son, and our families for all eternity. &nbsp;&nbsp;Through the 
		miracle of technology never before in the history of mankind has so much 
		of the word of the Lord been so readily available to so many.&nbsp; It is a 
		marvelous blessing I hope each of us will recognize and cherish as a 
		gift from God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Faithful saints of all ages, who have been blessed 
		with the presence of living prophets, have been anxious to listen and 
		hearken to them, and undoubtedly gathered as they were invited to be 
		taught by them and to feel the Holy Ghost bearing witness of the truth 
		of their words.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One such gathering must have been in response to 
		king Benjaminâs invitation to the people of Zarahemala as he desired to 
		teach them, before he went âthe way of all the earthâ (Mosiah 1:9).&nbsp; You 
		will recall he commissioned his son Mosiah, who would become their king, 
		to make a proclamation throughout all the land that the people should 
		gather to hear his final prophetic words.&nbsp; Mosiah did as directed and 
		proclaimed king Benjaminâs request that the people might gather 
		themselves to the temple so he could speak to them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can you imagine the excitement that must have 
		spread throughout the land?&nbsp; It might have been much like the excitement 
		we feel as we gather on Temple Square and around the Conference Center 
		for General Conference.&nbsp; The kingdom would be conferred on one of king 
		Benjaminâs sons.&nbsp; Surely they gathered to pay tribute to a king who had 
		loved them, taught them, worked with and for them, and had âspent his 
		days in their serviceâ (Mosiah 2: 12).&nbsp; The people came in countless 
		numbers â parents, children, and grandchildren â with the âfirstlings of 
		their flocks that they might offer sacrifices and burnt offerings 
		according to the law of Mosesâ (Mosiah 2: 3).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Two verses in the second chapter of Mosiah have 
		particularly caught my attention as I have tried to imagine this scene 
		in my mind.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âAnd it came to pass that when they came up to the 
		temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his 
		family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and 
		their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the 
		youngestâ¦And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man 
		having his tent with the doors thereof <i>towards the templeâ¦â (</i>Mosiah 
		2: 5-6 - Italics added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have likewise contrasted this scene with one from 
		the Old Testament describing the decision made by Lot, the nephew of 
		Abram.&nbsp; Given the opportunity to decide where he would settle, Lot chose 
		âall the plain of Jordanâ (Genesis 13: 11), while Abram then, settled in 
		the land of Canaan. &nbsp;We read that Lot, âdwelled in the cities of the 
		plain, <i>and pitched <b><u>his </u></b>tent toward Sodomâ </i>(Genesis 
		13: 12 â Italics added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I believe these contrasting images â one multitude 
		of faithful saints turning their tents towards the temple and their 
		prophet king, versus a man turning to everything worldly and wicked, 
		merit some reflection on our part to determine the direction our own 
		tents are facing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have been reminded on numerous occasions of the 
		unique and singular opportunity each of has at this time, on this campus 
		to witness the building of a temple, a House of the Lord.&nbsp; Its building 
		is a literal fulfillment of prophecy.&nbsp; I do not know that ever again in 
		my lifetime will I have the opportunity to be so close, to observe the 
		building of something so sacred.&nbsp; From our backyard and kitchen window 
		we can see the temple spire and the Angel Moroni.&nbsp; The temple is visible 
		for miles in all directions.&nbsp; Once the temple is dedicated each of us 
		will be but minutes from a building dedicated as a house of the Lord.&nbsp; 
		Surely, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for each of us to âturn 
		our tents towards the templeâ and our backs to worldliness.&nbsp; Lance Fry, 
		a former BYU-Idaho student created an image of this concept which looks 
		like this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="text-decoration: none">&nbsp;</span></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In his first General Conference address following 
		his sustaining as President of the Church, President Howard W. Hunter 
		said,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ââ¦I invite the Latter-day Saints to look to the 
		temple of the Lord as the great symbol of your membership.&nbsp; It is the 
		deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the Church worthy to 
		enter the temple.&nbsp; It would please the Lord if every adult member would 
		be worthy of â and carry â a current temple recommend.&nbsp; The things that 
		we must do and not do to be worthy of a temple recommend are the very 
		things that ensure we will be happy as individuals and families.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While I am certain there are many more, I would 
		like to suggest <b>five ways</b> that the temple can be a âgreat symbolâ 
		of our membership.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>First</b>, the temple is a symbol of Heavenly 
		Fatherâs love for his children, and a symbol of our love for Heavenly 
		Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">David, as recorded in Psalms said, âI will worship 
		toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and 
		for thy truthâ¦â (Psalms 138:2) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		As we participate in the temple endowment God grants to each of us a 
		great gift of spiritual knowledge.&nbsp; President Brigham Young gave this 
		definition of the endowment: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		âYour endowment is, to receive all those ordinances in the house of the 
		Lord, which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to 
		enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the 
		angels who stand as sentinels, being enabled to give them the key words, 
		the signs and tokens, pertaining to the holy Priesthood, and gain your 
		eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hellâ (<i>Discourses of Brigham 
		Young,</i> sel. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 
		1941), p. 416).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		While President Young made reference to a future event, there is great 
		strength to be had in the present as we make and keep sacred temple 
		covenants.&nbsp; Temple covenants qualify, edify, purify, and protect.&nbsp; They 
		qualify us as explained by President Young.&nbsp; We are edified as we are 
		taught sacred truths.&nbsp; We are purified as we strive to keep the 
		covenants we have made.&nbsp; And, finally they serve as a protection from 
		evil.&nbsp; Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained in the October 2006 <i>Ensign</i> 
		that: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		âThe power of your covenants is greater than the power of temptation.â</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Saints of God, and in particular the early saints 
		in these latter-days have sacrificed to build temples in obedience to 
		his commandments and as a gift to him and his Son.&nbsp; Accounts abound of 
		the sacrifices by many providing the materials, the means, and the labor 
		to design, build, and furnish these magnificent and holy structures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the dedicatory prayer of the Sacramento, 
		California temple President Gordon B. Hinckley said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âWe ask that Thou wilt accept it (meaning the 
		temple) as a gift of love for Thee and for Thy Sonâ¦Father, this house 
		has been made possible by the tithes and offerings of Thy people 
		throughout the world.&nbsp; Keep thine ancient promise to them.&nbsp; Open the 
		windows of heaven and shower blessings upon them, such that there will 
		not be room to contain them.&nbsp; Bless them for their faithfulness.â (<i>Church 
		News â week ending September 9, 2006)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="text-decoration: none">&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Has it ever occurred to you, that as you faithfully 
		pay your tithes and offerings, you do so as a gift of love to God and 
		the Savior?&nbsp; And, that you are literally contributing to the building of 
		temples around the world?&nbsp; Surely the Lord will bless the faithful 
		saints who willingly and faithfully pay their tithing â even and 
		especially when it requires great sacrifice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Second</b>, the temple is a symbol of learning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the temple great teaching takes place.&nbsp; We learn 
		of the Divine plan of salvation.&nbsp; We learn of the completeness of Godâs 
		plan for his children.&nbsp; We learn of the central role of the Lord Jesus 
		Christ in our eternal destiny.&nbsp; We come to understand that by attending 
		the temple worthily and regularly our lives will be filled with light 
		and knowledge, and truth.&nbsp; The temple is a house of revelation.&nbsp; Often 
		we may go weighed down by lifeâs challenges and struggles.&nbsp; In the 
		temple there is peace.&nbsp; In the quiet reverence of temple worship, God 
		can give us answers to our prayers and speak peace to our souls.&nbsp; I have 
		felt this peace on many occasions and bear witness that in the temple we 
		can feel of the Lordâs love and mercy in rich abundance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We also must understand the vital importance of 
		personal spiritual preparation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In his book, <i>The Holy Temple</i>, President Boyd 
		K. Packer teaches:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		âWhat we gain <i>from </i>the <span class="hit">temple</span> will 
		depend to a large degree on what we take <i>to </i>the <span class="hit">
		temple</span> in the way of humility and reverence and a desire to 
		learn. If we are teachable we will be taught by the Spirit, in the
		<span class="hit">temple</span>â¦ The <span class="hit">temple</span> 
		itself becomes a symbol. If you have seen one of the temples at night, 
		fully lighted, you know what an impressive sight that can be. The house 
		of the Lord, bathed in light, standing out in the darkness, becomes 
		symbolic of the power and the inspiration of the gospel of Jesus Christ 
		standing as a beacon in a world that sinks ever further into spiritual 
		darkness.â&nbsp; (<i>The Holy Temple, page 42)</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b>Third</b>, the temple symbolizes the most sacred, eternal, and 
		exalting covenants we may make in mortality.&nbsp; President Hinckley has 
		said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		âThese unique and wonderful buildings, and the ordinances administered 
		therein, represent the ultimate in our worship.&nbsp; These ordinances become 
		the most profound expressions of our theology.&nbsp; I urge our people 
		everywhere, with all of the persuasiveness of which I am capable, to 
		live worthy to hold a temple recommend, secure one and guard it as 
		precious asset, and to make a greater effort to go to the House of the 
		Lord and partake of the spirit and the blessings to be had therein.â (<i>Ensign, 
		November 1995, page 51)</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		In the temple we view our lives through the infinite and limitless 
		lenses of eternity.&nbsp; It is the connection between heaven and earth.&nbsp; In 
		the temple we become candidates for exaltation as we participate in the 
		endowment and sealing ordinances.&nbsp; It is there where the crowning 
		blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant are pronounced upon us.&nbsp; It is only 
		in the temple where eternal family units can be and are created and we 
		know that, ââ¦the family is central to the Creatorâs plan for the eternal 
		destiny of his children (<i>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</i>).â</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		Now, brothers and sisters, please listen to this next statement made by 
		President Boyd K. Packer:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><u><span style="text-decoration: none">&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		âThe very purpose of the Restoration centers on the sealing authority, 
		the temple ordinances, baptism for the dead, eternal marriage, and 
		eternal increase â centers on the family (<i>One Pure Defense</i>, An 
		Evening with President Boyd K. Packer, 6 February 2004)!â</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		Given what President Packer has taught and the doctrine contained in <i>
		The Family: A Proclamation to the World</i>, is it any wonder why Satan 
		is attacking marriage and the family at every turn?&nbsp; We know that 
		marriage is ordained of God.&nbsp; Satan will never have a marriage of his 
		own; so he would do everything in his power to create roadblocks, 
		obstacles, and attitudes that would dissuade young Latter-Day Saints 
		from anxiously pursuing the good cause of marriage.&nbsp; He seeks to destroy 
		traditional marriage through ill-inspired legislation and social 
		activism.&nbsp; He makes it fashionable to âcome outâ as homosexual couples.&nbsp; 
		We know that, âChildren are an heritage of the Lord â(Psalms 127: 3).&nbsp; 
		The Adversary will never have the privilege of being a father and 
		experiencing the supernal joy that comes from parenthood.&nbsp; How does he 
		react?&nbsp; He teaches that children are a bother; that career matters more 
		than building the character of a young child.&nbsp; He would have people 
		believe that day care providers can nurture a child just as well as a 
		loving mother.&nbsp; He teaches that same-sex couples can raise children just 
		as successfully as homes where there is a mother and a father who âhonor 
		marital vows with complete fidelity.â (The Family:&nbsp; A Proclamation to 
		the World)</p>

		I was raised in a part-member family; born to a faithful Latter-day 
		Saint mother and a supporting and loving but not-baptized-in-this-life 
		father.&nbsp; What I longed for the most growing up was to have a father that 
		could baptize me, ordain me to priesthood offices, give me priesthood 
		blessings, and parents to be with me in the temple when I was endowed 
		and married.&nbsp; Neither of my parents was with me on those days, and even 
		though my mother waited outside the temple for her only childâs wedding, 
		she would have had it no other way.&nbsp; Many of you may have been born in

		families similar to mine.&nbsp; Still others of you may be the only members

</b>will make as you establish your own families.</p>

		only in the temple where these ordinances can be received and these

		if young people really understood the blessings of temple marriage, they 
		would walk all the way to England if that were necessary (<i>Ibid and

<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<p class="MsoNormal">As I neared the end of my missionary service in the 
		Guatemala-El Salvador mission, my last area was in Santa Ana, El 
		Salvador.&nbsp; The branch where I was serving was presided over by a humble 
		and faithful man who was a tailor by trade.&nbsp; He and his wife earned a 
		living by making dresses, pants, and suits.&nbsp; They spent their days using 
		foot-powered, pedal sewing machines.&nbsp; Electric sewing machines were just 
		too expensive â and I assure you when I was a missionary it <b>was</b> 
		well after the discovery of electricity!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the time, the closest temple was in Mesa, 
		Arizona and each year the mission organized a bus trip so members could 
		come to the temple â anticipating this was to be an once-in-a-lifetime 
		experience.&nbsp; They came at great personal sacrifice.&nbsp; It would take years 
		for them to save enough to make the trip.&nbsp; They traveled by bus day and 
		night for five or six days to arrive in Mesa.&nbsp; They would spend four or 
		five days in the temple â working day and night, doing as much temple 
		work as they could.&nbsp; Then they would get back on the bus for five or six 
		more days back to their homes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day we were visiting with the branch 
		president.&nbsp; He told us he had nearly enough to bring his wife and small 
		family â it seems to me he had 3 or 4 children â to the temple on the 
		upcoming trip.&nbsp; He said, âI am very close to having all the money I need 
		for the trip, and I will sell my sewing machines, if necessary to have 
		enough.â&nbsp; I said, President, if you sell your sewing machines youâll 
		have no way to earn a living when you return.&nbsp; What will you do?â&nbsp; With 
		faith and a smile, he said, âI will gladly sell my sewing machines and 
		then I will find other ways to support my family when we return.&nbsp; I know 
		the Lord will bless us if we make the sacrifice.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I concluded my mission about two weeks before the 
		annual temple trip.&nbsp; I traveled to Mesa and stayed with a friend from 
		the mission and we were at a multistake center near the temple when 
		these wonderful saints from Central America arrived.&nbsp; One by one we 
		greeted them as they got off the bus.&nbsp; Finally, we saw this humble 
		branch president, a smile filling his face, step off the bus with his 
		wife and his children.&nbsp; He had saved enough â because he had sold every 
		one his sewing machines to make the trip.&nbsp; Truly, this was a family who 
		understood the importance of temple blessings and had <b><i>their </i>
</b>tent turned towards the temple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fourth</b>, the temple is a symbol of service.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would imagine that on more than one occasion you 
		have spoken the words, âI canât wait.â&nbsp; It may have been, âI canât wait 
		until I can drive.â&nbsp; âI canât wait until I can date.â&nbsp; I canât wait to 
		go on my mission.â&nbsp; âI can wait to start college.â&nbsp; âI canât wait to 
		graduate.â&nbsp; Or it may even have been, âI just canât wait until Brother 
		Kusch is finished with this devotional address!â&nbsp; But, how you would 
		feel if you had to wait 100, 200, or even 300 hundred years for this to 
		happen?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I believe there are many millions on the other side 
		of the veil who also may very well be saying, âI canât wait.â&nbsp; âI canât 
		wait until someone is baptized for me.â&nbsp; âI canât wait until someone is 
		endowed for me.â&nbsp; â<b>We</b> canât wait until faithful saints kneel at 
		an altar and are sealed for us.â&nbsp; Often, as I go to the temple, I am 
		doing work for someone who was born or died 200 or 300 years ago.&nbsp; That 
		is a very long time to wait for something so vital and important.&nbsp; Truly 
		the eyes of heaven are upon us, waiting for our redeeming efforts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As with all of the saving ordinances of the gospel, 
		we only receive them for ourselves once.&nbsp; After that, each time we 
		participate in those ordinances we do so in the temple, providing them 
		and making covenants on behalf of people who cannot do it for 
		themselves.&nbsp; They are dependent on us.&nbsp; It is godly service.&nbsp; It is 
		Christ-emulating service.&nbsp; It is an example of king Benjaminâs teaching 
		that, ââ¦when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in 
		the service of your God (Mosiah 2:17).â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Prophet Joseph Smith described our efforts with 
		temple and family history work as âbeing Saviors on Mount Zion,â 
		referencing the phrase from Obadiah in the Old Testament (Obadiah 
		1:21).&nbsp; He further taught as he expounded on Malachiâs teachings in the 
		4<sup>th</sup> chapter of Malachi,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âThe keys are to be delivered; the spirit of Elijah 
		is to come, the Gospel to be established, the Saints of God gathered, 
		Zion built up,&nbsp;and the Saints to come up as saviors on Mount Zion.&nbsp; But 
		how are they to become saviors on Mount Zion? By building their temples, 
		erecting their baptismal fonts, and going forth and receiving all the 
		ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings, 
		ordinations&nbsp;and sealing powers upon their heads, in behalf of all their 
		progenitors who are deadâ¦â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every one of us can be involved in temple work, as 
		âSaviors on Mount Zion,â by performing family history research and by 
		going to the temple to act as proxy for those now dead.&nbsp; There may be 
		some of you who have been called to serve in your stakes as family 
		record extractors.&nbsp; You are performing a valuable, though not highly 
		visible service.&nbsp; Please remember what happens with these names.&nbsp; You 
		are preparing them for temple ordinances.&nbsp; Any time you spend in this 
		worthy calling, you are acting as a âSavior on Mount Zion.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fifth</b>, the temple is a symbol of purity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When a temple is dedicated, it literally becomes 
		the House of the Lord.&nbsp; A recommend is required for entrance, granted 
		after a searching interview.&nbsp; The standard of worthiness is high; given 
		by the Lord.&nbsp; After all, it is His house we are entering.&nbsp; As Elder 
		Henry B. Eyring taught, those who enter in, ââ¦have to be pure enough to 
		go where the Lord himself can go (First Worldwide Leadership Training, 
		January 11, 2003, page 11).â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the temple we dress in white clothing to 
		symbolize the purity and worthiness that must be a part of our lives.&nbsp; 
		There we are all the same regardless of position, social status, or 
		wealth.&nbsp; The temple represents everything, ââ¦virtuous, lovely, of good 
		report, and praiseworthy (Articles of Faith, number 13).â&nbsp; But even 
		more, it represents everything godly, everything perfect, everything 
		exalted, and everything celestial.&nbsp; There are no places on earth more 
		pure, more perfect, or more holy than the temples that have been built 
		and dedicated as houses of the Lord.&nbsp; Each temple bears the inscription, 
		âHoliness to the Lord. &nbsp;The House of the Lord.â&nbsp; Surely, our lives must 
		reflect that same purity and holiness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, how do we âturn our tents towards the templeâ 
		and all that it symbolizes?&nbsp; And what does that really mean? We cannot 
		be facing two directions at once.&nbsp; So, as we turn towards the temple, we 
		turn our backs to worldliness.&nbsp; We might think of it as daily 
		repentance.&nbsp; We read in the Bible Dictionary that, ââ¦repentance comes to 
		mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin 
		to which we are naturally inclined (Bible Dictionary, page 760).â&nbsp; The 
		scriptures are filled with invitations to turn and come unto Christ, to 
		put off the natural man, and become a saint through yielding our hearts 
		to his will (Mosiah 3: 19).â&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My suggestions as to how we might do this are not 
		unique, new, or even clever.&nbsp; They are so simple and oft-repeated you 
		may dismiss them.&nbsp; But it is my witness and my testimony that when 
		applied, these principles will, indeed, help us in our progress toward 
		becoming, ââ¦a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord (Mosiah 3: 
		19).â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, my final list of suggestions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First â sincere and humble daily prayer.&nbsp; It was 
		the prayer of a young boy in 1820 that unlocked the heavens and began 
		the marvelous events of the Restoration that we are privileged to enjoy 
		today.&nbsp; We are commanded to, ââ¦do all things with prayer and 
		thanksgiving (D&amp;C 46: 7),â to, ââ¦counsel with the Lord in all our doings 
		(Alma 37: 37),â ââ¦to pray always that we may come off conqueror (D&amp;C 10: 
		5), âand that if we are humble the Lord shall lead us by the hand and 
		give us answers to our prayers (D&amp;C 112: 10).&nbsp; In the very same way 
		heaven opened to Joseph Smith it can be so for us today.&nbsp; It will likely 
		not be through the type of experience Joseph had in the sacred grove, 
		but it <b><i>will </i></b>be personal and specific to our individual 
		needs.&nbsp; Of that I am certain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second â sincere and daily study of the 
		scriptures.&nbsp; Feasting upon the words of Christ, likening the scriptures 
		unto ourselves, studying and applying the principles and doctrines found 
		in the scriptures are vital in our efforts to have our hearts and 
		natures changed on our journey toward greater discipleship.&nbsp; Here are a 
		few things I have found particularly helpful in my own scripture study.&nbsp; 
		Every week I read and prepare the weekly Sunday School lesson.&nbsp; I find 
		that when I make the designated curriculum of the Church a part of my 
		regular scripture study I have been blessed beyond measure in the things 
		the Holy Ghost has taught me.&nbsp; I keep a scripture journal where I write 
		down the important lessons I am learning, and the impressions I receive 
		as I study â impressions of things I need to be doing that often may not 
		have any relationship to what I am studying.&nbsp; Now, you may be saying, 
		âBrother Kusch, I donât really have time to study the scriptures in 
		great depth â I have homework, I work, I need to exercise, what about my 
		social life?â&nbsp; I would just say this:&nbsp; if you will demonstrate your 
		desire for greater discipleship by making a <b><i>free will offering</i></b> 
		of your time to learn spiritual things you will be blessed and your 
		schoolwork will not suffer.&nbsp; It is entirely possible that you may not 
		have all the time you might like to study the scriptures.&nbsp; It might only 
		be ten or fifteen minutes on any given day.&nbsp; Begin your study with a 
		brief prayer and explain your situation.&nbsp; âHeavenly Father, I only have 
		fifteen minutes to study today, but please allow the Holy Ghost to teach 
		me something!â&nbsp; I am confident that if your desires are sincere you will 
		be taught, even if a few short minutes is all you have.&nbsp; I bear witness 
		of that based on my own personal experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Third, find ways to serve.&nbsp; Be the very best you 
		can be in your Church assignments. You will recall that President Clark 
		admonished us to do just that in his devotional remarks this semester.&nbsp; 
		Many of you will not have major callings in your wards that are overly 
		demanding and time-consuming.&nbsp; Look for other ways to bless and lift 
		those around you. Pray that the Lord may show you opportunities, and 
		most importantly, when he does, act upon them right away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fourth, be obedient without rebellion.&nbsp; Great 
		blessings are promised the faithful saints. &nbsp;&nbsp;As we yield our hearts to 
		God and offer our whole souls as an offering we qualify to receive the 
		sanctifying and purifying blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. 
		&nbsp;If you have already made temple covenants be diligent and faithful in 
		keeping them without compromise.&nbsp; If you have not yet made them, become 
		a person preparing to make them by strictly obeying the covenants you 
		have made.&nbsp; Realize, too, that those who truly understand the purpose of 
		the Honor Code will see it is to help us obey the higher law, and that 
		it is a preparatory and refining step for making more sacred covenants 
		in the House of the Lord.&nbsp; How can we qualify to make exalting temple 
		covenants when we chafe at the simple things we are asked to do?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, letâs take the garbage out of our lives.&nbsp; 
		Letâs have the courage and the faith to stop participating in things 
		that harm us spiritually and that cause the spirit to withdraw.&nbsp; To 
		successfully navigate lifeâs turbulent waters we need the inspiration, 
		guidance, and personal revelation only available through the 
		companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Recall what Elder David A. Bednar 
		taught in the April 2006 General Conference:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The standard is clear. If something we think, see, 
		hear, or do distances us from the Holy Ghost, then we should stop 
		thinking, seeing, hearing, or doing that thing. â<b><u><br />
&nbsp;</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We are a people of faith, living in a 
		mostly-faithless world.&nbsp; The Lord is counting on us to be everything we 
		have promised we will be.&nbsp; We know what we should do.&nbsp; I pray that we 
		might possess the integrity and the desire to do it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I express my gratitude to my Heavenly Father for 
		the rich blessings of the gospel.&nbsp; I am grateful for the unique 
		experience of witnessing the building of a temple. I am anxious for the 
		spirit it will bring to this community and into our lives.&nbsp; I am humbled 
		to know it is a place the Savior himself may visit.&nbsp; I am grateful for 
		all the temple symbolizes, for the eternal covenants that bind me to 
		Deity, to my parents, my wife, my children, and my posterity.&nbsp; I 
		encourage each of you to live worthy of, and carry a temple recommend 
		and never be without one, no matter how close to or how far from a 
		temple you may be.&nbsp; Even though she knew she would never be able to use 
		it, I will never forget the experience of interviewing a young mother 
		for a temple recommend just days before she died.&nbsp; She had terminal 
		cancer, but was determined to leave mortality worthy of and with a valid 
		temple recommend. Elder Neil Andersen of the Presidency of the Seventy 
		counseled us in our recent stake conference that the temple needs to 
		become a larger part of our lives.&nbsp; I pray that it may be so as we 
		indeed turn our tents towards the temple - not only as we prepare for 
		the dedication of the Rexburg temple, but throughout our lives.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I appreciate the mention of my English-Australian 
		heritage, if only for one reason. Some of you will very quickly notice 
		that I have an accent. I often find Iâve been talking to people for 
		several minutes and I have the distinct feeling they arenât really 
		listening to me. Then they suddenly ask, âWhere are you from?â And I 
		realize that nothing Iâve said for the past few minutes has sunk in. So 
		Iâm glad thatâs out of the way and you can listen without distraction!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was amused some years ago when a young student 
		from Utah asked me incredulously, âDo we have an accent?â So, for those 
		who may think as she did, understand that the language Iâm speaking now 
		is an ancient one known as E-n-g-l-i-s-h. Unfamiliar as that may be to 
		you, do please try to keep up. If you have questions for me later, I do 
		understand Idahoan - as long as you speak slowly and use hand gestures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I donât know how often devotional speakers in the 
		past have addressed the topic that Iâve chosen today. Iâm not going to 
		talk about Church public affairs even though thatâs my professional 
		work. My topic may be an unusual one for this young audience and I know 
		Iâm taking something of a risk in choosing it. &nbsp;Certainly when I tell 
		you that family history is my topic, many of you may think itâs a better 
		subject for old people, and the rest of you will want to go to sleep. 
		But I hope by the time Iâve finished youâll understand why itâs 
		important. You are the tech-savvy generation. You bring to the table 
		certain qualifications, aptitudes and experiences which are familiar to 
		your generation. And weâll see in a few minutes why thatâs invaluable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I want to start today by reading to you an entire 
		section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Fortunately, itâs the shortest 
		section in the whole book and consists of just three verses. Itâs also 
		in my view one of the most remarkable passages in all
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		scripture</span>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âBehold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by 
		the hand of Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great and 
		dreadful day of the Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And he shall plant in the hearts of the children 
		the promises made to the fathers, <u>and the hearts of the children 
		shall turn to their fathers</u>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly 
		wasted at his coming.â&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(D&amp;C 2)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is a great deal that is remarkable about this 
		passage, but to me one of the most amazing things isnât in the text at 
		all. Itâs in the date. September 21, 1823.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Different religious groups might interpret this 
		passage differently, but when <i><u>we</u></i> read this passage we know 
		immediately that has something to do with family history and temple work 
		and the sealing power of the priesthood. But no one knew <i><u>anything</u></i> 
		about genealogy or temples <i>in 1823</i> when this message was 
		delivered by Moroni to Joseph. Joseph himself could not possibly have 
		understood its significance. He was 17 years old. It was to be seven 
		years before the Church was even organized, and 13 years before Elijah 
		would appear in the Kirtland temple to fulfill this prophecy. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nearly 20 years later when Joseph was preaching at 
		the funeral of Brother King Follett, he had come to understand its huge 
		significance. But not in 1823 when he would have made little sense out 
		of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So why would the Lord after centuries of darkness 
		and the absence of prophets make this one of the first scriptures of the 
		new dispensation of the Fullness of Times? What was so hugely important 
		that the Lord would make sure this message was recorded and written down 
		before dealing with anything else, including the organization of the 
		Church and all of the other revelations that followed?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Equally significant, perhaps, is that these words â 
		or some very like them â were also the closing words of the Old 
		Testament. So the closing words of the Old Testament and some of the 
		opening words of the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times address the 
		same topic!&nbsp; Perhaps Moroni gave a clue to its importance when he said 
		that if the hearts of the children donât turn to their fathers, the 
		whole earth would be wasted at the Lordâs coming. Why wasted?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I think some of the answer is found in the 
		question: how many people have ever lived in the entire history of the 
		world?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you type that question into a Google search 
		engine youâll find a surprising number of scholarly articles on the 
		subject. The Population Reference Bureau puts the figure at 106 billion. 
		Others are much higher or lower, and of course they are all guesses 
		based on the absence of critical data and many variables. But letâs take 
		one of the lowest estimates â around 60 billion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		Let me</span> help you visualize this. The
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		entire circle</span> represents everyone who has ever lived. The dark 
		blue segment is
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		proportionately</span> how many people live on the earth today.&nbsp; And 
		that thin line you see represents the
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		12 million</span> Latter-day Saints in the world. In fact, Iâve 
		exaggerated that line because if I were to draw it proportionately it 
		would be so thin you wouldnât even see it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now look at the orange segment of roughly 60 
		billion and consider how few of the billions of people represented there
		<i><u>ever heard the gospel in its fullness</u></i>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We read in the New Testament that as Christâs body 
		lay in the tomb his Spirit went to the spirit world where he opened the 
		preaching of the gospel to the dead. In 1 Peter 4:6 we learn in clear 
		language why he
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		did that</span>. </p>

		have responded to his message, do you think?&nbsp; Millions? Billions? But 
		the ordinance work has to be done here on earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now consider how much family history and temple 
		work has to be done by the tiny fraction of Latter-day Saints who 
		qualify by reason of age, worthiness and reasonable proximity to a 
		temple to undertake this work for the dead. Even if we assume all 12 
		million Latter-day Saints were engaged in family history and temple work 
		(which is, of course, impossible), the pie chart can only represent that 
		number as a very thin line, too small even to make a wedge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And, you know what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Itâs too easy to talk about 
		numbers in the abstract. The sheer number of spirits waiting for temple 
		ordinances is so overwhelming that we may find it difficult to 
		appreciate that every spirit is one of our Fatherâs children. These 
		spirits we are talking about are not just forgotten names. These people 
		lived and loved and died, and struggled with the challenges of life, 
		just like we do except usually in very much harder circumstances. So let 
		me help you visualize it a little.</p>

		Or these</span> two children, one playing in the street of an English

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âThe father of this little nomad may be a warlike

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How interesting that National Geographic would use 
		the phrase âdivine heritageâ to describe âmother love.â&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For me, Latter-day Saint doctrine on this topic is 
		one of the most glorious concepts revealed during this dispensation.&nbsp; 
		For some of our fellow-Christians, the photographs of people that Iâve 
		shown you represent people who are lost.&nbsp; They didnât accept Jesus 
		Christ as their personal savior in this life, and thatâs all there is to 
		it. It doesnât matter that they lived in a part of the world where the 
		name Jesus might never be heard. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I want to ask you in all seriousness, what kind of 
		a God would it be who would institute a set of conditions for his 
		children to meet â faith, repentance, baptism and so forth â and then 
		automatically exclude the vast majority of his children from ever 
		meeting those conditions.&nbsp; What about the Buddhists or the Hindus, or 
		the people who lived under atheistic communism? What about the countless 
		millions who have lived in Christian nations but whose faith has been 
		nominal at best, through an impartial understanding of the gospel and an 
		absence of anyone to teach them or lead by example?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
		the term we most commonly use for God is âHeavenly Father.â That is no 
		casual term. God is a loving Father who cares about every one of his 
		children and who will not leave them to chance. Since he has given them 
		moral agency, there must also be a way for them ultimately to exercise 
		the great choices that will help determine their destiny.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, we know that temple work will be among the 
		great works of the Millennium when much of this work will be done. But 
		it has started now!&nbsp; My purpose today is to help you understand 
		something of the role that you can play in the Lordâs plan. It may not 
		be the same role that your parents are playing. &nbsp;It doesnât have to be 
		demanding in time or energy. But it will turn your hearts to your 
		fathers in ways you can scarcely imagine. Not to the Bedouin or the 
		Taiwanese, probably, but to your own people certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Iâd like you just for a moment to try to see things 
		from the Lordâs perspective. Imagine that you are seeing things from the 
		Lordâs point of view, and that you are contemplating the billions of 
		spirits who have to hear the gospel and receive ordinances if the whole 
		earth is not to be wasted. I would think you would want to do the 
		following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>First, I would think youâd make the importance of work for 
		the dead abundantly clear in scripture, in the Old Testament as well as 
		the New, and perhaps putting the message at the close of the Old 
		Testament so the words can ring through the centuries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I would think that you might, at the beginning of the 
		final dispensation, send a resurrected prophet to impress upon the 
		bright and receptive mind of the young Prophet of the Restoration 
		something so important that it would stay with him throughout his 
		ministry and not be lost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I would think you would send Elijah, as soon as the 
		Kirtland temple was completed in 1836, so he could fulfill that ancient 
		prophecy to turn the key and usher in the great work of redeeming the 
		dead through sealing ordinances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I think you might choose to inspire governments to begin 
		to keep census and civil records â for example, the beginning of civil 
		registration in England in 1837 - the precise year that missionaries of 
		the Restoration first set foot in that land.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I think if you were in the Lordâs position you might 
		choose to inspire early Church leaders to encourage the gathering of 
		records to help make this work possible, even as early as 1894 when the 
		Genealogical Society of Utah was established. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I would think you would be anxious to put into the hands 
		of your children the technical means for a quantum leap in research to 
		discover available names, through microfilm and later digital technology 
		and the Internet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I would think you would prompt Church leaders to invest 
		substantially in the technology and the infrastructure to aid the Saints 
		in this work and move it forward at speeds inconceivable a few years 
		ago.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>I think you might inspire a modern prophet to build 
		temples at a rate inconceivable to earlier generations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
<span style="font-family: Symbol">Â·<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></span>And, I think maybe you would stand ready and willing to 
		respond to every heartfelt prayer for help from a worthy member of the 
		Church who understands something about praying with âreal intent, having 
		faith in Christ.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe thatâs what you might do, if you were 
		concerned about the whole earth being utterly wasted at his coming. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, this is a devotional and not a genealogy 
		class, so Iâm not going to talk to you about how to do research. Every 
		ward has people who are called to advise you about that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What I do want to do this afternoon is suggest some 
		things that will help turn your hearts to your fathers. Acknowledging 
		that there is a time and a season for every purpose, I want, 
		nevertheless, to start you thinking about family history as a lifelong 
		pursuit so itâs never far from your minds. And I want to help enrich 
		your temple experiences and prepare you to make the temple a lifetime 
		focus. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, why would I choose this message for this 
		audience? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I doubt whether thereâs a person in this entire 
		audience who isnât very familiar with how to use a computer. The same 
		isnât true for your parents, so I want you to do something next time 
		youâre in their home. I want to give you three quick housekeeping tasks 
		that need to be done before we can move onto the exciting stuff. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, if your parents have a computer at home with an 
		Internet connection but donât have a genealogy program on their hard 
		drive, go to
		<span style="font-style: italic; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		familysearch.org</span> and download a free copy of Personal Ancestral 
		File for them. It will take you a few minutes to set that up and youâve 
		removed obstacle number 1.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Obstacle number 2 is the myth that says, âMy family 
		history is all done.â There are also variations of this, such as âUncle 
		Fred is the family historian and he does it allâ. Thatâs a bit like 
		saying âWell I donât go to Church, but thatâs OK because Uncle Fred goes 
		for me.â&nbsp; The fact is that for our hearts to be turned to our fathers, 
		to forge that welding link that seems so important to the Lord, we need 
		to be personally engaged in this work. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And it hasnât all been done, Brothers and Sisters â 
		I guarantee it.&nbsp; We each have two parents and four grandparents, and 
		they double each generation. In 10 generations you have 512 of them â 
		not counting the thousands of other family members they bore. My longest 
		line is 16 generations. If I had every 16<sup>th</sup> great grandparent 
		and every direct ancestor between me and them I would have nearly 33,000 
		direct ancestors. A month or so ago I received an email from someone 
		working on his 31<sup>st</sup> generation. He would have more than 1 
		billion, seventy three million direct forebears if he had them all. It
		<u>isnât</u> all done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Third step. If your family has never done any 
		family history work, sit down with them and get them to physically enter 
		their own names into Personal Ancestral File, or whatever other program 
		you have on your computer. Enter just husband, wife and children, no 
		more for the moment â just their names, birth dates and places, marriage 
		dates and places, etc. That might take you 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If they have their records only in written form, on 
		pedigree charts or in a shoe box, get them to start entering the names 
		and dates and places on the computer. Once information is transcribed, 
		miracles can start to happen as itâs shared on the Internet, as weâll 
		see in a moment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now the next step is where you have to work a 
		little. Get a digital recording device â a digital video camera is great 
		if you have access to one, but audio is better than nothing â and start 
		talking to your parents about their early lives, what they remember of 
		their parents and grandparents. Do this in multiple sittings, but get it 
		down while you still have the blessing of living parents. If you donât 
		have that blessing, then get to the aunts and uncles or anyone of 
		previous generations. If you donât do it, those memories will pass out 
		of existence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may say that itâs easier said than done to get 
		your parents to sit down at a keyboard or in front of a recording device 
		and do this. I donât buy that. My wife and I raised eight teenagers and 
		I have never encountered anything with such formidable persuasive power 
		as a teenager or young adult who wants something. Whether itâs âDad, my 
		life will be over if I canât borrow the keys to the car,â or just 
		talking me out of that last $20 in my wallet, I know from personal 
		experience that you can do this. You are hard wired-that way. You are 
		unstoppable when you have made up your mind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now with those preliminaries out of the way, I want 
		to open up to you a world that you may never have experienced. Itâs the 
		world of your forebears.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I never knew my Dad. I knew he was a soldier in the 
		British Army in World War II. I knew he had been a Prisoner of War for 
		several years. But I didnât know much else.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Two months ago I posted this on the Internet. I 
		know you canât read the screen so
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		Iâll read</span> it to you. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">âRobert Otterson was 
		buried in the summer of 1949. Rifle shots were fired over the grave and 
		a Union Jack draped the coffin. Later, his older brother would say of 
		the funeral wake that it was a particularly silent affair. The usual 
		attempts to cheer up the mourners with stories and even a little humor 
		were absent. Such was the stunned reaction to the death of a man who, at 
		37 and as a professional soldier, had spent more years away from home 
		and family than he had ever wished. Three of those years had seen him 
		incarcerated as a prisoner-of-war, first in North Africa, then in Italy 
		and finally in Germany. As he walked up the narrow street of a village 
		in Surrey, England, to be reunited with his family again in the late 
		spring of 1945, he described his feelings as âon top of the world.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Four years later he 
		was dead. Not the glorious battlefield death of a soldier, but a common 
		road accident that threw him from his motor bike on a Welsh country 
		road. For me, his son, it meant growing up without a father. I was nine 
		months old and have no memory of him. I felt no particular deprivation 
		during my boyhood - due, no doubt, to a devoted mother and two caring 
		older sisters. But as I grew older I began to sense the loss. I missed 
		the experience of talking to a father. I missed the things I imagined he 
		would have taught me. I missed his wisdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Yet that fact has been 
		the stimulus for me to learn all I could about his life. Over the years 
		I have recreated from interviews, letters and journals what I could not 
		learn first-hand. I share it now for his children, his 10 grandchildren 
		and 21 great grandchildren, with the hope that they will come to know 
		and appreciate this remarkable man.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And Iâm still learning. I never knew whether there 
		was any trace of the German prison camp where my father spent the last 
		months of World War II. But this past summer my wife and I
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		found</span> the huge flat field in what used to be East Germany, near 
		Muhlberg on the Elbe River. Using my Dadâs prison camp journal, we 
		followed the route he took when he grew tired of the Russian military 
		authorities who liberated the camp in March 1945 but who wouldnât let 
		the Allied soldiers leave. So he and a friend slipped out of the camp 
		anyway, and tracked across fields and streams, headed for the American 
		lines 40 kilometers to the west. Overnight they slept in a barn with 
		German refugees to avoid the Russian patrols. Finally they reached the 
		River Mulde. Over the other side of the bridge were the American front 
		lines. My father describes his feelings as he walked over that bridge 
		and shook hands with American soldiers on the other side. For the first 
		time in years, he said, he felt âreally free.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, of course, you know what I did this past 
		summer. I walked across that bridge over the Mulde River as my father 
		had done, and I shook hands with the only home-grown American in our 
		company â my son-in-law.&nbsp; I then
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		stood</span> on the bank of the river with the bridge in the background, 
		and read from my fatherâs journal as my daughter recorded it. That will 
		now be posted on our website at otterson.us in the hope that it will 
		help turn the hearts of my children and grandchildren to their fathers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What if I hadnât been able to travel to Germany? 
		That is the wonderful thing about the power of the Internet. As I 
		mention some of these discoveries, I hope you are thinking about the 
		parallels in your own families and what you should search for, and what 
		you can find.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From the
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		Reiksmuseum</span> in the Netherlands I found a picture of the gates to 
		the camp known as Stalag IVB, as it had stood on that field you saw 
		earlier. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From an Italian naval site I found a picture of the 
		prison ship that carried my father from North Africa to Italy, across 
		the Mediterranean for three miserable days. Many of the men had 
		dysentery. There was no proper sanitation. They slept below decks on 
		metal floors, wretched, hungry souls who didnât know if they would 
		survive. My father describes his place on the ship, below the aft hatch. 
		Then I found
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		this</span> on the Internet, on a site for model ship building. It is 
		the very ship, the Ugo Foscolo, that carried those British prisoners of 
		war across the Mediterranean. You can clearly see the hatch he 
		describes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When they finally disembarked, they faced a 
		5-kilometer march â an eternity it seemed to some of them â to their new 
		camp near Bari on the Adriatic coast. As they shuffled through the 
		village, my father depicts it this way:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">âAs we passed through 
		the city, the doors and windows of every house were filled with curious 
		spectators.&nbsp; There were giggling girls, mocking youths, grave-faced men 
		and an old lady who watched while tears ran down her furrowed cheeks. 
		&nbsp;Truly, our appearance was more to be pitied than laughed at, but 
		ragged, unkempt, dirty and half-starved as we were, we unconsciously 
		held our heads erect, got into step and gazed defiantly back at the 
		mocking faces, while the war songs of 25 years ago burst from our lips 
		and echoed through the street.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So why is this important?&nbsp; Because when I stand in 
		the baptismal font of a temple â as I did in London in 1976 for my 
		father â or <u>complete any temple work for someone whose life Iâve 
		studied</u>, the experience is immeasurably richer.&nbsp; And even <u>if all 
		I can find on the Internet is a description of the time and place</u> in 
		which an ancestor lived â and that is the case for most of them - it 
		still enables me to make a connection. Family history for me now is not 
		just names and dates, but flesh and blood, experiences to be passed on, 
		stories to bind and strengthen families. Could the Lord also have had 
		this in mind when he said that the hearts of the children would be 
		turned to their fathers?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are a blessed generation. Many of you are the 
		beneficiaries of journals and stories of your own that have been passed 
		down. Please donât be casual about them. Treasure them and learn more, 
		and make sure they are recorded and shared â on the Internet if 
		possible. You are not frightened or hesitant about the technology that 
		is now making possible the most stunning advances in connecting families 
		and resurrecting the stories of their lives. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of you may have seen the movie, âWhere Jesus 
		Walked.â&nbsp; A few of you have even been to Israel. Perhaps youâve sat on 
		the slopes overlooking Galilee, or walked the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem 
		where tradition says Christ carried his cross to Golgotha. Or maybe 
		youâve stood in Gethsemane.&nbsp; Such experiences, while not essential to 
		spirituality, have a catalyzing effect for many. Itâs hard to read the 
		scriptural accounts of those events afterwards and not feel a 
		connection.&nbsp; Our hearts and minds are drawn to the experience and we 
		become stronger as a result.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let me share a few quick experiences that show 
		how doors will be opened if we do our part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Everything Iâm going to show you has been written 
		and discovered in the last several weeks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recently I received an email from a complete 
		stranger about someone on my wifeâs line. When you post your family 
		history on the Internet â and thatâs one of the first things you need to 
		do - you can get a lot of email if you do it right. The writer was 
		responding to one of many postings I had placed on the Internet. His 
		email said basically, is your Henry Wright born in 1782 the same person 
		as my Henry Wright also born in 1782. Such exploratory emails are very 
		common in the genealogical world. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we affirmed the right dates, places and other 
		names, he proceeded to deliver 1,100 names back to the 1500s, well 
		researched, with documented sources.&nbsp; That led to much more, including 
		old photographs and missing information to fill in stories. It even led 
		to my wife rediscovering the best friend of her youth â a second cousin 
		with whom we had lost contact 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My wife, Cathy, whose interest in actually doing 
		family history, to put it diplomatically, has beenâ¦ intermittentâ¦ over 
		the years, mentioned to me after receiving this flood of names that she 
		had been praying for help in finding her ancestors. I looked at her in 
		surprise because she hadnât mentioned it. âHow long have you been 
		praying about it?â I asked. âAbout three weeks,â she said. âBut I prayed 
		really sincerely.â&nbsp; Iâm not sure what that says about my prayers for 40 
		years, but it does show that help may be closer than you think.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a direct result of that one email, we
		<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		added</span> four pages to our family history website.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Notice the picture at the top left. I know you 
		canât see it very well but itâs concepts I want to share, not detail. I 
		was adding to the research one evening at the computer and my wife was 
		dozing in an armchair. âGuess what,â I said. âYou have hobbits in your 
		family tree.â&nbsp; We had found that the area where her newly found 3<sup>rd</sup> 
		great grandfather was born was the very same picturesque area that 
		inspired Tolkien to describe the Shire in Lord of the Rings and the 
		Hobbit. OK, itâs a stretch, but when you canât claim royalty, hobbits 
		will do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we continued to research this family line on the 
		Internet, the emotional connections became stronger as we got into the 
		lives of relative after relative. The 2<sup>nd</sup> great grandfather 
		who, as part of an occupying British army in Ireland, married an Irish 
		Catholic girl and brought her back to England â not an easy thing to do 
		in those days. The second wife who died in childbirth in the store room 
		of a military barracks in Liverpool. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is truly astonishing what can now be found 
		online, from the comfort of your own home. The methodology is not a 
		subject for a devotional, but there are plenty of sources out there to 
		show you how. The motivation, however, is another thing. And thatâs what 
		weâre talking about today â that inner drive that will make you connect 
		emotionally and even spiritually with your forebears in a way that is 
		transformational.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let me illustrate with one last story. In the 
		summer of 1842, the British Government produced a report on the 
		appalling conditions for the children of very young ages who were 
		working in the English coal mines of the Industrial Revolution. The 
		report is an extremely weighty one, running to hundreds of pages. It 
		includes interviews with many of the children who suffered unbelievable 
		conditions as they worked in almost total darkness to help eke out a 
		living for their families.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I want to read you an extract in the report, the 
		testimony of one boy who began working in the mines at the age of 8. 
		This is what he said in 1841 when he was questioned about his work. The 
		language is in places obsolete and the occupational terms unfamiliar, 
		but youâll get the gist of it. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âI became a door keeper on the barrow-way four 
		years ago. I got up at four oâclock, took breakfast, walked to the pit 
		by half past four; began work at five. I had no candles allowed at all, 
		except my father gave me any; he gave me four, which burnt about five 
		hours, and I sat in darkness the rest of the timeâ¦.I used to sleep; I 
		could not keep my eyes open. The overman used to bray us with the yard 
		wand; he used to leave the marks; I used to be afraid. The putters 
		sometimes thumped me for being asleepâ¦.We loose at five and come home. I 
		got my dinner, washed; I took off all my clothes, and then went to bed 
		about eight. I did not go out to play; the more we play, the more we 
		sleep in the pit.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That testimony was given by 12-year-old John 
		Otterson. The father he refers to and who gave him four candles each 
		day, was my 3<sup>rd</sup> great grandfather, Nicholas Otterson. Not 
		surprisingly, that 12 year old boy didnât want the life of a miner. 
		Instead, he joined the Royal Navy where he served on a man of war â not 
		in itself an easy life either, by the way. His wife died young, but he 
		remarried and moved to the great English naval port of Portsmouth. He 
		was 81 when he died - from a fall down the stairs of his home. And 
		everything I have just told you came from the Internet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, Brothers and Sisters. Thereâs nothing unique 
		in this. Thousands of people have awoken to the realities of how our 
		electronic age can transform our knowledge of our forebears and help us 
		discover what was previously almost impossible to find. Most of your 
		parents either canât do this because they donât know, or they need 
		encouragement. This is your world â the world of Windows Explorer and 
		Firefox, of iPods and iMacs, of digital files, of multiple audio and 
		video formats. I donât believe the Lord intended these inventions just 
		for entertainment or email or chat with friends.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%">
		One</span> of the things I love about the gospel of Jesus Christ is that 
		we all matter. People living here and now and people who have gone 
		before. The gospel is individual. Faith, repentance, how we live our 
		lives, how we choose to respond to the priceless gift of the Atonement. 
		Each person is as different as you and me. What will you do to help 
		discover who they are, to preserve their memories and to help bring them 
		the saving temple ordinances? The agricultural laborer, the sailor on a 
		man-of-war or frigate, the cobbler and the needle maker and the 
		dressmaker, the pioneer and those who long preceded them - all children 
		of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joseph F. Smith was President of the Church in 
		October 1918 when he had the remarkable vision now recorded as Section 
		138 in the Doctrine and Covenants. Part of that section reads thus, 
		speaking of the preaching of the gospel to the dead:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp; 30 âBut behold, from among the 
			righteous, he (Jesus Christ)&nbsp; organized his forces and appointed 
			messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them 
			to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in 
			darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel 
			preached to the dead. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;31 And the chosen messengers went forth to 
			declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim liberty to the 
			captives who were bound, even unto all who would repent of their 
			sins and receive the gospel. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;32 Thus was the gospel preached to those 
			who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in 
			transgression, having rejected the prophets. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;33 These were taught faith in God, 
			repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, 
			the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;34 And all other principles of the gospel 
			that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves 
			that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live 
			according to God in the spirit.â</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May your hearts truly turn to those whose 
		sacrifices have helped you become who you are. May you feel the reality 
		of the Spirit of Elijah. May you use your natural gifts and talents and 
		experience to help capture the stories that make your families special, 
		and that will help bind your children and your childrenâs children 
		through those common experiences.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		December 5, 2006</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a pleasure and 
		an honor to speak with you today and I pray for the presence of the 
		spirit to be with us as we learn together. The opportunity to study at a 
		university where the Spirit of the Lord prevails is an unparalleled 
		prospect. This is a marvelous time for each of us to be on the campus of 
		BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. It is not by chance that 
		you are here. Use your time wisely and the benefits will return to you 
		throughout your entire life. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And while it is truly notable to be here on campus, 
		it is an even more wonderful time to be alive in the history of the 
		world. The scriptures are full of prophetic visions of our day. With 
		great awe ancient prophets saw the miracle of these times in which we 
		live. It must have been astonishing. And now you are here, experiencing 
		what they could only have yearned for.&nbsp; Never before have young people 
		had so many opportunities for growth, learning, and success. But we are 
		only stewards. If you are wise, the Lord can direct your paths and help 
		you to fulfill your own personal destiny to its fullest. The field 
		before you is green and fertile. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Having been raised in a rural setting, I quickly 
		became acquainted with the importance of fields and pastures. As a small 
		child, my family moved to what was then a small rural town in Utah. My 
		parents sought a lifestyle that living in the country would offer and 
		knew the blessings it would bring to their family. We lived in a modest 
		home surrounded by several acres of pasture. My father prized this 
		pasture and he gave it great care and nurturing. It required the help of 
		his entire family.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I remember getting up in the middle of the night to 
		help him when it was our turn to access the local irrigation system. As 
		spring approached I would assist him on the tractor as he worked to 
		prepare the pasture for summer. There were thorns and other weeds that 
		constantly needed removing. Fences would be checked and repaired or 
		replaced. It simply required a lot of hard and dedicated work. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But my father knew something, or perhaps felt 
		something, that I did not understand until much later. The love and toil 
		toward this small plot of ground was not for the pastureâs sake, but for 
		the animals that he loved and cherished. He cared for his animals and 
		wanted them to be happy and comfortable. My father knew if these animals 
		were properly provided for and watched over, they in turn would love him 
		and ultimately bring great joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I look back fondly upon those satisfying days of 
		caring for this pasture, I am vividly reminded of two interrelating 
		passages of scripture that have great significance and importance. These 
		particular passages are so tender, so moving, so filled with hope, that 
		Christians world-wide have these sacred messages deeply engraved upon 
		their minds, and their hearts. Hymns and great choruses have been 
		created from their words and messages continue to be delivered from 
		their text. Ironically, the words are simple; yet the imagery is 
		powerful. These scriptures of which I speak are found in the Book of 
		Psalms, and the Book of Isaiah. You probably know them well. They read:
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>The Lord is my 
		Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pasturesâ¦. 
		(Psalms 23) </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>He shall feed his flock 
		like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them 
		in his bosomâ¦. (Isaiah 40:11)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why are these words so beloved? Why is this 
		language so touching? Perhaps it is their poetic composition. Maybe it 
		is the potent use of illustration. But could it be that within these few 
		phrases lies an important allusion pointing the way for us to lead happy 
		and meaningful lives? Within these scriptures, three specific and 
		fundamental elements are mentioned. They are: shepherd, sheep, and 
		pasture. I would like to take a moment and review each of these 
		prominent players in this metaphor of life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The scriptures are filled with references to a 
		Shepherd. This shepherd is one that goes before and leads his sheep. He 
		knows how to succor their needs and wants because he fully comprehends 
		them.&nbsp; He is completely experienced with the environment in which they 
		dwell. The Shepherd has power to keep them safe from harm and lead them 
		to peace. While living amongst his disciples, the Savior plainly 
		declared: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><i>I am the good 
		shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.<br />
		(John 10: 14)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He also said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><i>&nbsp;I am the good 
		shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><i>&nbsp;(John 10: 11)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of this unusual shepherd, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland 
		said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â<i>When He bids us to walk in His way and by His light, it 
		is because He has walked this way before us, and He has made it safe for 
		our own travel here. He knowsâ¦how to succor his people according to 
		their infirmities.â</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, the Savoir Jesus Christ truly 
		is the loving shepherd.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Important to the shepherd are his sheep. Who are 
		the sheep and why are they valued? Sheep have great need because of 
		their inherent and natural limitations. To truly be at peace and reach 
		their full potential, they must have the help of a greater source who 
		loves them. The sheep follow their shepherd because they sense, and even 
		seek, his great power, knowledge, and ability to assist them. And in 
		spite of the sheepâs weaknesses, shortcomings, ignorance, and frailties, 
		they have come to know their master will protect and help them. Again, 
		in Psalms we read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>So we thy people and 
		sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for everâ¦.â (Psalms 79:13)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like sheep, each of us, no matter how great or 
		small must have help from a greater source to be guided toward our full 
		potential. Simply put, those who love the Savior and follow him are the 
		sheep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, the third element of our discussion is the 
		pasture. What is the pasture? What is its purpose? Is it important? It 
		is evident that sheep cannot provide pasture for themselves. They cannot 
		prepare it, nor groom it. Nurturing and maintenance is beyond their 
		ability. If they wander from the pastureâs safety they may become lost, 
		or even worse, destroyed. Yet, from the pasture, sheep must draw their 
		life giving nourishment. Within its bounds they will live out their 
		destiny.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While the pasture is less spoken of, it is a 
		fundamental component to the progress of those who depend on it. The 
		pasture symbolically represents the world in which we live. And even 
		more specific, it is integral to our individual lives and the path we 
		each must trod. In other words, our personal pastures are the individual 
		situations of our lives. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to focus the remainder of my message 
		today upon the pasture prepared, or being prepared, for each of us. As I 
		think about the Saviorâs watchful and guiding care in each of our lives, 
		I am reminded of a tender hymn:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Lord my pasture will prepare</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And feed me with a shepherdâs care.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His presence will my wants supply</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And guard me with a watchful eye.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My noonday walks He will attend</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my silent midnight hours 
		defend.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Lord My Pasture Will Prepare, 
		no. 109.)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The words of this hymn are true. They are not 
		merely poetic, but are words of actuality if we choose to allow the 
		Savior to guide and direct our daily affairs. In fact, we must allow him 
		to direct us if we are to experience joy and reach our full potential. 
		Just as sheep are limited in their capabilities, we likewise are placed 
		into a situation, a pasture if you will, requiring us to âlook to God 
		and live.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Savior taught his disciples this principle long 
		ago while sitting on a hill side. It has since become known as the 
		Sermon on the Mount. I can picture the setting: a warm beautiful day 
		with blue skies and rolling hills as a backdrop. I can also imagine 
		beautiful flowers, plants, and trees dotting the landscape around the 
		Savior as he taught. No other location could have been more appropriate 
		for the message He was about to deliverâa powerful message about a 
		simple and delicate flower. A Lily.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From this gentle analogy of a simple and elegant 
		flower, the Savior, our shepherd, taught us a loving and life saving 
		principle about our personal pastures. Please read with me in Matthew 
		6:28-30:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>And why take ye thought 
		for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil 
		not, neither do they spin: </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;And yet I say unto 
		you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of 
		these. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Wherefore, if God so 
		clothed &nbsp;the grass of the field, which to day is and to morrow is cast 
		into the oven, shall he not much more clothe youâ¦?</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, the Lord continues to teach 
		us this important principle today. We must rely upon Him to guide and 
		help us in every facet of our lives. The lily is considered to be a 
		thing of splendid beauty. And yet, lilies of the field simply and 
		naturally permit the life that is within them to unfold and fill the 
		measure of their creation. They do not toil. They rely upon God to help 
		them with things they cannot control or order. For a lily to survive, 
		continual rains must descend, the soil must provide proper nutrients, 
		and the sun must give adequate light. Each of these elements must be 
		available in the correct amounts and in their proper times. The lily 
		fulfills its full measure of creation by relying on the Lord for 
		sustenance in all things. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the Lord so graciously prepares a field in which 
		a delicate flower can grow to reach its full and marvelous potential, 
		surely He will do the same for us. He will prepare our own personal 
		pastures that will help us find our maximum capabilities and reach the 
		full measure of our creation. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The word pasture is derived from the Latin word <i>
		pastus</i> or <i>pascere</i>, meaning âto feed.â References to a pasture 
		imply the Lord will feed us our âdaily bread,â and our daily direction. 
		And even through what may seem as an occasional lack thereof, He is 
		helping us to gain experience and become more like him. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may ask, âWill the Lord truly help me with my 
		individual needs?â âHow deeply does He care about my concerns?â âDoes He 
		know me individually and understand the desires of my heart.â As one of 
		the least, my dear brothers and sisters, I bear testimony from my own 
		personal experience that He does! This is the good news; this is the 
		gospel. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord has known you for a very long time. He 
		knows your name. Your weaknesses and strengths are before him. He will 
		help you with your studies. He will help you find the focus of your 
		education. Your talents and abilities are evident to Him. Does it not 
		seem reasonable for the Lord to guide you to meaningful and productive 
		work, whether it is in the home or workplace? After all, you will be 
		spending a great portion of your life in this pursuit. If you believe 
		the gospel is centered on the family and can preserve your relationships 
		through the eternities, isnât it also reasonable to believe the Lord 
		will help you find a mate to bring joy and fulfillment? And if you are 
		experiencing a difficult challenge, wouldnât someone who loves you 
		enough to give their life for you also help and sustain you through your 
		trials? Surely our Shepherd will do all this for us. Elder Jeffrey R. 
		Holland has said,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>âThose who will receive 
		the Lord Jesus Christ as the source of their salvation will always lie 
		down <b>in green pastures</b>, not matter how barren and bleak the 
		winter has been.â (âSpecial Witness: Look to the Savior,â Friend, Oct. 
		2003, 33.)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Examples of individuals who have been led by the 
		Lord to lie in green pastures are found in abundance. They relied upon 
		Him for their guidance and direction, and He in turn magnified them. I 
		would like to share with you three particular examples. Each story is 
		different, yet in each case the individuals trusted the Lord and He in 
		return prepared the way before them, helping them to become better and 
		contribute more to others.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first example is found in the Book of Mormon 
		with a seemingly insignificant Lamanite woman.&nbsp; Her name was Abish, a 
		servant in the court of King Lamoni. It is quite possible you do not 
		recall Abish in your studies. She is only mentioned briefly. However, 
		without Abish, a woman prepared by the Lord, the conversion process of 
		many from the Lamanite nation would have had a significantly different 
		outcome.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The story goes like this. Ammon, a Nephite, had 
		decided along with his friends to live among the Lamanite people. They 
		were anxious to assist in bringing these people out of darkness and unto 
		Christ. Through several miraculous circumstances, Ammon was eventually 
		brought before the kingâapparently no small thing to experience and 
		remain alive. Through several more remarkable events, the King (and 
		eventually the Queen) believed the words of Ammon as he taught them. 
		Being overcome by the Spirit, they had fallen to the earth as if they 
		were dead. Even Ammon himself, in expressing his gratitude for the 
		Lordâs manifestations among the people, had fallen to the ground. As you 
		might imagine, this caused quite a stir amongst the kingâs court. The 
		servants were astonished and feared. They, too, began to pray and fell 
		to the earth. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, one very special maidservant named Abish 
		had long before been prepared by the Lord for what was about to happen 
		at that exact moment. The story is found in Alma 19:16-17:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;And it came to pass 
		that theyâ¦ had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of the 
		Lamanitish <span style="color:black">
<a title="Alma 19: 28." style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/19/16a">
<span style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#000080">women</font></span></a></span>, 
		whose name was Abish<b>, she having been converted unto the Lord for 
		many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father</b>â</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Thus, having been 
		converted to the Lord, and never having made it
		<span style="color:black">
<a title="JS-H 1: 74." style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/19/17a">
<span style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#000080">known</font></span></a></span>, 
		therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had

		to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon 
		lay <span style="color:black">
<a title="Moses 1: 9 (9-10)." style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/19/17c">
<span style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#000080">prostrate upon 
		the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that 
		this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened 
		among them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to believe 
		in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making 
		it known unto the people.&nbsp; </font></span></a></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By quickly spreading the word about this remarkable 
		happening, many of King Lamoniâs kingdom entered the court to witness 
		the event for themselves. They watched the miracle unfold as those who 
		seemed dead awoke and bore powerful testimony of the Lord. The story 
		ends with a significant multitude of Lamanites believing the words of 
		Ammon and converting to Christ. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, here was one woman, carefully prepared and 
		completely converted, among a nation of bitter unbelievers. How could 
		this be? Abish had been fed and led by the Lord. Her pasture had been 
		prepared.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Examples such as these are not only limited to the 
		scriptures or a previous time. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hope you will allow me to share with you a 
		personal example. For much of my life I have enjoyed the beauty and 
		inspiration found within the arts. A profound love and growing knowledge 
		of them has been enriching for me personally and provided a solid 
		foundation for my career. But this has not always been the situation. 
		Growing up in a rural town, my access to classical music, fine art, and 
		great literature was limited. My parents, who understood my desires 
		better than I did myself, purchased a piano when I was young and had 
		provided me with lessons. It opened the door, but I had not yet fully 
		appreciated or connected with the power, beauty, and influence the arts 
		can demonstrate. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I will never forget one very important day in my 
		sixteenth year when my life would take a different direction. Like so 
		many teenagers, I was working at a local fast food restaurant. I had 
		just come out of the kitchen when I glanced over at the drive-up window. 
		The high school faculty member responsible for music was there. I spoke 
		with him for a few moments, took his order, and then continued on about 
		my daily work. A few minutes later I began handing him his order through 
		the window as he responded with a simple, yet pivotal question. He said, 
		âWe are having our choir kick-off social tonight. It would be great if 
		you could come.â He then added the words, âDo you think you can make 
		it?â As my mouth responded, âSure,â my mind thought, âWhat in the world 
		are you doing? This is not cool.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I did, however, go to that social and it was a 
		wonderful and satisfying experience. It felt natural. My life would be 
		forever changed. I eventually found a subject matter and a social circle 
		that connected deeply. Through opening the door to music, I would soon 
		be introduced to art, and eventually great literature. An understanding 
		and a love of these tools would continue to grow as I matured. Respect 
		and appreciation for them have been critical to the pasture of my life 
		and has brought with it a fulfilling richness, as well as an opportunity 
		to serve and help others. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Through the course of this very small experience, 
		along with many others, I have come to see clearly the influential hand 
		of a loving and kind shepherd who has brought all things together for my 
		good. Because it has happened for me, I know it will be the same for 
		you. This is true and I bear testimony of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, I know of another very special and sacred 
		account I would like to share with you. I first heard this story nearly 
		two years ago at a Presidentâs Council Question and Answer session. I 
		was deeply touched as the spirit witnessed the truth of its message. I 
		knew then, and even more so now, that the Lord had prepared the way for 
		two very special people to be here on our campus with us today. I share 
		this with their permission. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just over two years ago, President and Sister Clark 
		were at home in Boston watching the Saturday afternoon session of the 
		October 2004 General Conference with a few members of their immediate 
		family. President Hinckley was in the process of sustaining Elder David 
		A. Bednar as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. When the sustaining 
		was over, the Clarksâ son loudly exclaimed, âDad, dad, youâre going to 
		be the next President of BYUâIdaho.â With a puzzled look, President 
		Clark stared at him for a moment and then said, âWhat? Where did you get 
		that!?â âI donât know,â his son said, âbut you are going to be the next 
		President of BYUâIdaho.â That simple statement was the beginning of a 
		remarkable series of events for President and Sister Clark.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the seed planted in their minds, the Clarks 
		started talking about the possibility of coming to BYUâIdaho, but never 
		spoke of it with anyone. Still, the more President Clark pondered the 
		idea, the more the desire began to grow within his heart. It continued 
		to increase until April 2005 when he asked Sister Clark if she had 
		noticed an announcement in the Church News about a new President for BYUâIdaho. 
		She hadnât. With piqued interest, President Clark decided to visit the 
		universityâs website to see if a new President had been announced. After 
		a little research, he determined the position had not yet been filled.
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Spirit continued to direct and prepare the 
		Clarks. A month later, in May, President Clark was scheduled to play 
		golf. It turned out to be a rainy day, which left him with a free 
		afternoon. President Clark felt a strong impression to attend the 
		temple. Sue had already been earlier that morning, so he decided to 
		attend by himself. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As he walked into the temple, an unusually strong 
		and overwhelming feeling of peace and joy surrounded him. He felt the 
		presence of the Spirit. Later, after the endowment session, he began to 
		pray.&nbsp; President and Sister Clark knew he would be stepping down soon as 
		Dean of the Harvard Business School. Several new opportunities had 
		already begun to emerge, but President Clark wanted to know Heavenly 
		Fatherâs will. As he prayed, he said, âHeavenly Father, we will do 
		anything you want us to do. Weâll go anywhere, weâll do anything, but 
		could you just please let us know which one of these options weâre 
		supposed to do. And could you let us know in a way where thereâs no 
		doubt. . . a clear answer of what we should do.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The answer would come in a most remarkable wayâ¦ and 
		soon. As President Clark arrived home, Sue noticed several messages had 
		been left on their answering machine. She began listening, and then 
		handed the phone to her husband, saying, âI think youâd better listen to 
		this one.â It was a message from President Hinckleyâs secretary. He said 
		President Hinckley would like to speak with President Clark and asked 
		him to return the call. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Clark immediately dialed the number and 
		reached President Hinckleyâs office. A few minutes later the prophet 
		came on the line. After a brief conversation, he asked if President 
		Clark would be interested in presiding over BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. 
		Such a question would normally be overwhelming, but President Clark was 
		truly prepared to answer. His mind was ready and eager to respond.&nbsp; With 
		all the energy of his soul, he replied, âI would.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From that moment until President and Sister Clarkâs 
		arrival in Rexburg, a series of marvelous events prepared them for their 
		new responsibilities. President Clark said, âIt was as if the windows of 
		heaven literally opened, and we received a tremendous outpouring and 
		understanding of the university and a love for the students.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is certainly clear to all of us who have come to 
		know and love the Clarks that they were singularly prepared by the Lord 
		for their service here among us. But, is it equally clear to you that 
		Heaven will guide and direct your paths in a similar way? Do you see the 
		hand of the great Shepherd in your life? Are you aware of what the Lord 
		has already done to prepare your pasture? Perhaps a brief inventory of 
		the blessings that exist in each of our lives will provide evidence that 
		our individual pastures have been, and are even now being prepared.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We are blessed to live in the last days so long 
		foretold. The gospel has burst upon the world in a glorious manner. 
		Truth is upon the earth and can easily be found by the honest seeker. 
		This one fact alone is quite remarkable. Have you ever stopped to 
		realize that throughout history most of the worldâs population has come 
		to earth, lived out their lives the best they could, and died without 
		the blessings you enjoy daily? Some were in complete darkness, some 
		having only a sense of the truth. In contrast, you have access to full 
		truth before you in the bright light of day. You can receive answers to 
		your prayers and know the purpose of your existence. Priesthood keys are 
		on the earth to move forward the kingdom of which you are apart. Most 
		important, you have complete knowledge of the redeeming love and 
		atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And not only do you have the truth, you also have 
		the attendant blessings of that truth. The world you know and experience 
		each day is a very different world than that experienced by even your 
		grandparents, and certainly by those who lived only a few generations 
		before. Communication and transportation is possible at speeds never 
		dreamed of by earlier individuals. Information on nearly every 
		conceivable topic is available at your finger tips instantaneously. A 
		trip from Salt Lake City, Utah to Nauvoo, Illinois would take you 
		approximately three or four hours to complete. That same trip took our 
		early pioneers three to four months. While many people who lived before 
		you received little or no education, expertise and knowledge on nearly 
		every subject is available to you at a relatively low cost. Many 
		individuals have suffered much of their lives in oppression and poverty. 
		The prospect you will enjoy freedom and prosperity is quite likely. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is truly a marvelous time to be alive. In 
		short, you have already been provided a most green and fertile pasture. 
		With gratitude and acknowledgement that the Lord has prepared a way for 
		you thus far in your life, you can move forward with faith and 
		confidence knowing that He will continue to do so. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But some of you might be wondering how you can 
		receive more fully of this direction from heaven. It is possible to have 
		greater access to the Saviorâs guidance. The scriptures teach us of 
		Lordâs willingness to help and guide us. Please read with me in <br />
		Matthew 7:7-10:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Ask, and it shall be 
		given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto 
		you:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>For every one that 
		asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh 
		it shall be opened.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Or what man is there of 
		you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if he ask a fish, will he give 
		him a serpent?</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ask, knock, and seek: three very important gospel 
		words. Recently my wife and I were acquiring artwork for our home. In 
		the process we came across a striking piece that communicated a simple 
		message in a poignant way. The words âask,â âknockâ and âseekâ were 
		placed next to each other in a line. Above each individual word was a 
		photo of a beautiful and inviting door waiting to be opened. The message 
		was direct and clear. Blessings and direction from the Lord are there 
		for us to partake but we must first put forth effort and do our part.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are other words that instruct us of ways in 
		which we can do our part and receive of the Lord. In teaching my 
		advertising class, I share with students a potent key for creating 
		successful text. The key is simply to use âaction verbs.â Action verbs 
		motivate us to do something. I would like to introduce you to a few 
		gospel action verbs found within scripture. These examples can help us 
		more fully receive guidance and assistance from the Lord. You will 
		notice in each instance an invitation is given to take action followed 
		by a promised blessing. The words are: trust, take, seek, look, and 
		give. A sermon could be written on each of these words but I will share 
		with you only a few basic thoughts. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, âtrustâ. In order for the Lord to bless you 
		in your individual lives you must <b>trust</b> him. The world will 
		provide many substitutes for you to rely on but there is only one sure 
		foundation, one lasting and true way to find happiness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and 
			lean not unto thine own understanding.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>In all they ways acknowledge him, and he 
			shall direct they paths.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>(Proverbs 3:5-6)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Second, âtakeâ. Life 
		can be challenging with many options to weigh you down. One of the 
		greatest paradoxes of life is that as you fully <b>take</b> upon you the 
		gospel of Jesus Christ, the heavy burdens of life are actually lightened 
		and even lifted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><i>Take my yoke 
			upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye 
			shall find rest unto your souls.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><i>For my yoke is 
			easy, and my burden is light. (Matthew 11:29-30)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now third, âseekâ. There are many options for you 
		to <b>seek</b> in this life. Sultry, sumptuous, and even silly 
		temptations are on every side. But if we put the Lord first in our lives 
		and help accomplish His work in the kingdom we will be rewarded and 
		receive richly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>... seek ye first the kingdom of God, and 
			his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 
			(Matthew 6:33)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fourth, âlookâ. Where do you <b>look</b> and to 
		whom do you <b>look</b> when you are in need? We look to that which we 
		love and receive of its rewards in return. Are you a fair-weather and 
		finicky friend? Or do you include the Lord in all your decisions and 
		desires?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, 
			fear not. (D&amp;C 6:36)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And last, âgiveâ. What you do with what you are 
		given is critical to the process. As the lord prepares a pasture for 
		you, the gifts and blessings received are best utilized in the service 
		of others. By giving to others you will in return be blessed. In other 
		words, receive; give to others that which you receive; and then you will 
		receive again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Give, and it shall be 
		given unto youâ¦. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall 
		be measured to you again. (Luke 6:38)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would now like to conclude with a few words of 
		inspired counsel from President Hinckley. These words should have 
		particular meaning to you as students here at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. 
		They were given on this very campus not long ago to students just like 
		you. They are words for you and provide powerful insight into ways the 
		Lord can prepare your pasture of life. I will never forget the day. 
		President Hinckley had delivered his prepared remarks. He set them aside 
		and announced that he would like to express a few words 
		extemporaneously. The room was silent and the Spirit was pervasive. With 
		tears in his eyes and great love for the students of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho, 
		he began:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful for a prophet 
		on the earth today who guides us to truth and fulfillment. I bear my 
		witness that the Lord âmy pasture,â and âyour pasture,â will 
		prepareâultimately helping us find the way back to his presence. I leave 
		with you my witness that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the way.&nbsp; I know 
		God lives and Jesus is our Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Two Instructive Experiences</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, thank you for the privilege 
		and pleasure of being invited to join your devotional today.&nbsp; I pray the 
		Spirit will prompt and instruct each of us, that we may understand, be 
		edified, and rejoice together (D&amp;C 50:22).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some years ago I spent a summer internship 
		researching cross-cultural negotiations at the East-West Center in 
		Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have never forgotten a testimony I heard while 
		attending the local ward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A window washer cleaned tall office buildings in 
		downtown Honolulu.&nbsp; Proud of his work, he made the windows sparkle.&nbsp; 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day, while working high above the busy streets, 
		the window washer fell.&nbsp; His safety harness broke.&nbsp; He grabbed the rope 
		but was already falling too fast.&nbsp; The rope tore through his thick work 
		gloves, then into the flesh of his hands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The pain became excruciating.&nbsp; He knew he would die 
		if he let go, but it hurt so much he could not hold on.&nbsp; He could not 
		hold on to save himself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As he fell, he saw in his mind is wife and 
		children.&nbsp; He loved them.&nbsp; He wanted to stay with and continue caring 
		for them.&nbsp; He felt his Saviorâs strengthening love.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He could not hold on to save himself, but he could 
		hold on because he loved his wife and children, because he felt his 
		Saviorâs love.&nbsp; Instead of letting go and falling to his death, he held 
		on.&nbsp; As I recall, he slowed his descent just enough that, on impact, he 
		broke both arms and both legs.&nbsp; But he lived.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Holding on is sometimes a matter of life and 
		death.&nbsp; So sometimes is letting go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My wife Susan once interviewed a fine father.&nbsp; This 
		father loved and was proud of each of his children.&nbsp; This included a 
		talented and hard-working son who was raising a good family while 
		serving as a young bishop.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day his son was brutally murdered.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The father said if the courts donât nail my sonâs 
		murderer, Iâll see to it myself that murderer gets what he deserves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day the father and his family were arriving at 
		the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing.&nbsp; A reporter pushed a microphone 
		into one of their faces.&nbsp; Upset, the family member reacted 
		aggressively.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was then the father realized hate was starting 
		to consume his family.&nbsp; He loved his family.&nbsp; He did not want hate to 
		consume them.&nbsp; Perhaps he could not let go of hate for his own sake, but 
		he would let it go for his familyâs stake.&nbsp; He would let go of hate to 
		hold onto love.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The father came to see his sonâs murderer was 
		himself a son, whose parents were faithful and devout community 
		members.&nbsp; The murdering son had shattered not only his life, but also 
		the lives of his now grief-stricken parents.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The father who had lost his son reached out to the 
		parents who had lost their son.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In reaching out and letting go, the father again 
		found faith and hope onto which he could hold in even the darkest 
		hours.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Holding On and Letting Go </u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps we will not have to hold on or let go like 
		the window washer in Hawaii or the father who chose to forgive his sonâs 
		murderer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But, in our own varied circumstances, we too must 
		learn to hold on, let go, and know when and how to do each.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As in all things, the scriptures, prophets, and 
		especially the perfect example of our Savior teach us when and how to 
		hold on and let go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Letting Go</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Letâs begin with letting go.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you know you can trap a monkey using only a box 
		with a small hole in its side?&nbsp; Place a tempting nut in the box.&nbsp; The 
		monkey reaches its fist through the hole and grabs the nut.&nbsp; Once the 
		monkey grabs the nut, its closed fist will not fit back out through the 
		hole.&nbsp; Because it wonât let go, the monkey is taken captive.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Do we ever go âapeâ or ânutsâ?&nbsp; We laugh, but 
		sometimes we do.&nbsp; Sin, rationalization, procrastination, stereotypes, 
		misunderstandings of various kinds can hold us captive -- until we let 
		them go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Sin</u> can hold us captive â until we let it 
		go.&nbsp; Moved by Ammonâs testimony, King Lamoniâs father pledges, âI will 
		give away all my sins to know thee [God]â (Alma 22:18). &nbsp;&nbsp;Gospel light 
		transforms us as we let go of bad habits and sin.&nbsp; Lustful internet 
		images, inappropriate physical closeness, unkind comments we give or 
		offenses we take:&nbsp; each can hold us captive until we repent -- and let 
		them go.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let go of sin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Academic rationalization</u> can hold us captive 
		â until we let it go.&nbsp; Perhaps we blame others when we donât fulfill our 
		academic potential.&nbsp; We say, âI learned the right material, itâs just 
		the teacher asked the wrong questions on the test.â&nbsp; Or, âthe teaching 
		assistant didnât review this.â&nbsp; Or, âWhy do I have to attribute my 
		sources -- after all, I did quote word for word from Wikipedia?â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let go of academic rationalization.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Procrastination</u> can hold us captive â until 
		we let it go.&nbsp; Perhaps we let past concerns or future fears keep us from 
		living right now.&nbsp; Perhaps we procrastinate real study, mission, 
		marriage, children, or responsibility for self-reliant work.&nbsp; 
		Procrastination robs us of the joy and satisfaction which come from 
		meeting daily challenges right now.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps we have the perfect study plan â and will 
		begin right after we finish our computer game or after (you fill in the 
		blank).&nbsp; Said the apostle Paul, âWhen I was a child, I spake as a child, 
		I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, 
		I put away childish thingsâ (1 Cor. 13:11).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Live right now.&nbsp; Let go of procrastination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A <u>derogatory stereotype</u> can hold us captive, 
		perhaps without our even knowing it â until we let it go.&nbsp; Susan and I 
		once hired young ward members to help in our yard.&nbsp; Without realizing 
		what they were saying, our young friends used racial slurs to denigrate 
		manual labor.&nbsp; To their credit, once it was pointed out to our young 
		friends what they were saying, they stopped immediately.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Hinckley and other Church leaders express 
		âspecial love and concern for the eternal welfare of all men and women, 
		regardless of religious belief, race, or nationality, knowing that we 
		are truly brothers and sisters because we are sons and daughters of the 
		same Eternal Father.â<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">1</font></span></span>&nbsp;
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let go of derogatory stereotypes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of us are held captive by misunderstanding 
		often deriving from partial or incomplete knowledge of a gospel doctrine 
		or principle.&nbsp; For example, we may wrongly believe we can and must be 
		perfect on our own now.&nbsp; Or we may wrongly believe we can sin a little 
		because God will beat us with a few stripes and we will be saved (2 
		Nephi 28:8).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both these misconceptions derive from incomplete 
		understanding of the miraculous way our Saviorâs atonement mediates two 
		contradictory truths:&nbsp; first, imperfect mortals all sin (1 John 1:8) 
		and, second, God cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance 
		(D&amp;C 1:31; Alma 45:16).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Often Satan twists truth to create lies -- in this 
		case, two great lies.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of Satanâs great lies twists the truth that 
		imperfect mortals all sin.&nbsp; Satan lies, âA little sin wonât matter.â&nbsp; 
		âNo one will know.â&nbsp; âItâs no big deal.â&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As C.S. Lewis writes in the Screwtape Letters, âThe 
		safest road to Hell is the gradual one -- the gentle slope, soft 
		underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without 
		signposts.â<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">2</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we fall for his first lie, Satan hits us with a 
		second great lie.&nbsp; This second lie is the opposite the first.&nbsp; It twists 
		the truth that God cannot look upon sin with the least degree of 
		allowance.&nbsp; Now Satan accuses, âYour sin is enormous!â&nbsp; âGod hates 
		sinners.â&nbsp; âNo matter what you do, you will never again be clean or 
		worthy.â&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Satan uses these two lies to separate us from our 
		Savior.&nbsp; Satan tells us we must be perfect now, on our own, without the 
		atonement and without Christ.&nbsp; When we cannot do the impossible, Satan 
		tells us we are worthless, that neither God nor the Church want us.&nbsp; But 
		neither is true.&nbsp; God loves us and Christ atoned for our sins.&nbsp; Sin is 
		real, but so is the atonementâs cleansing power.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I counsel with young adults in our student 
		stake, I notice opposite patterns of holding on and letting go.&nbsp; Some 
		mistakenly think the atonement is easy and automatic; they hold onto 
		sins by repeating them.&nbsp; Others mistakenly think the atonement couldnât 
		include them after what they have done; they hold onto guilt, even after 
		confessing and forsaking mistakes (D&amp;C 58:43).&nbsp; In both cases, for quite 
		different reasons, too individuals many hold onto sin and guilt instead 
		of repenting fully and letting them go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Forgiveness (that is, letting go) can precede 
		repentance.&nbsp; We can forgive others even before they have repented 
		fully.&nbsp; As we forgive unconditionally, peace and progression fill our 
		lives.&nbsp; Our Saviorâs atonement can heal all hurts, including those 
		received through no fault of our own.&nbsp; In a world sometimes unfair, we 
		can be held captive by injustices, perceived or actual, until we let 
		them go.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Let us understand the atonement and let it set 
		us free.</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of us are held captive by the misunderstanding 
		that God rewards righteousness with wealth, luxury, or ease and that God 
		punishes wickedness with disappointment, sickness, or other trials.&nbsp; 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A kind nurse saw a child, through no fault of his 
		own, covered by grievous burns.&nbsp; A clinical expert, the nurse knew the 
		excruciating pain third-degree burns cause.&nbsp; She said no loving God 
		would allow an innocent child to suffer such pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then the nurse testified, as she was praying in 
		anger about how unloving and unfeeling God was, she saw in her mind our 
		Savior.&nbsp; He was weeping.&nbsp; Our Savior was weeping with her for the 
		child.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The nurse understood.&nbsp; While omnipotent, our 
		Heavenly Father does not cause or make all things happen.&nbsp; In our 
		limited perspective, we may ask why God allows bad things to happen to 
		good people.&nbsp; But a more complete or eternal perspective helps us 
		understand âbad thingsâ and âgood peopleâ with different eyes.&nbsp; After 
		all, the Lord told the Prophet Joseph âall these things shall give thee 
		experience, and shall be for thy goodâ (D&amp;C 122:7).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Let us understand Godâs eternal omnipotence and 
		eternal compassion.&nbsp; </u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of us are held captive by the misunderstanding 
		that we can hold onto Zion without letting go of Babylon.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We may want to be righteous, but not yet.&nbsp; We avoid 
		the sin, but hold onto its appearance.&nbsp; Perhaps we seek to appear 
		fashionable, extreme, edgy, cool, or push the limits in how we dress, 
		speak, posture with each other.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This may include how we portray ourselves online.&nbsp; 
		In a recent Sunday school class in our student stake, we discussed three 
		questions.&nbsp; First, âDo you protect your credit card and financial 
		identity?â&nbsp; Every hand went up.&nbsp; Second, âDo you protect your 
		cyber-identity, e.g., address, phone number, class schedule, etc., which 
		appear online?â&nbsp; Some hands went up.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I invited a few volunteers to share their MySpace 
		or Facebook profiles.&nbsp; Let me ask you:&nbsp; Would you feel comfortable 
		showing your profile in Sunday School?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then our third inquiry, âDo you protect your 
		spiritual identity?&nbsp; If your parents or bishop saw your profile what 
		would they think?&nbsp; What would your spouse or children, current or 
		future, think about you spiritually if they saw the profile you use 
		today?â&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you know many employers now review profiles and 
		other online information?&nbsp; Most screen names are functional or for fun.&nbsp; 
		But would an employer feel comfortable hiring winkydink cutiepie 
		pinkygirl hotty14 to do important legal briefs?&nbsp; Or what about hotstuff 
		daddyo dabomb rm34 to put a mature face on the firmâs new regional 
		office?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One student said, âI always thought my profile was 
		private, but now see some of the pictures and links my friends posted 
		have got to go.â&nbsp; She concluded, âI want my profile to reflect who I 
		really am.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Let us understand Zion is the pure in heart and 
		we become Zion by letting go of everything that is not Zion.</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Letting go is essential.&nbsp; So is holding on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Holding On</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Three things the scriptures admonish us to hold 
		onto include âthe word of God,â âevery good thing,â and âevery good 
		gift.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Book of Mormon teaches us to hold unto the word 
		of God.&nbsp; âAnd they said unto me:&nbsp; what meanth the rod of iron which our 
		father saw, that led to the tree?&nbsp; And I said unto them that it [the rod 
		of iron] was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of 
		God, and would <i>hold fast unto it</i>, they would never perishâ (1 
		Nephi 15:23-24; italics added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Helaman 3:29, we read:&nbsp; âWhosoever will may <i>
		lay hold upon the word of God</i>,â â¦ which shall âlead the man of 
		Christ in a straight and narrow course â¦â&nbsp; We avoid the Adversaryâs 
		temptations, fiery darts, blindness, and destruction by staying on the 
		straight and narrow path.&nbsp; This is only possible if we hold onto the 
		iron rod of Godâs word.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">3</font></span></span>&nbsp; 
		&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When young couples come for marriage interviews, it 
		is my privilege to ask the questions which establish testimony and 
		personal worthiness.&nbsp; In discussing tithing, Word of Wisdom, law of 
		chastity, or other commandments, I sometimes state, âPlease understand:&nbsp; 
		as your priesthood leader I am not asking these questions to keep you 
		from entering the House of the Lord.&nbsp; Rather, when you are in the holy 
		temple, we want you to know you are worthy to receive each eternal 
		blessing pronounced upon you.â&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes that statement helps young couples 
		understand what to let go of and what to hold on to.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Hold onto the word of God and obey His 
		commandments.</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A second scriptural admonition is to âlay hold upon 
		every good thingâ (Moroni 7:19).&nbsp; Moroni teaches, âSearch diligently in 
		the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will <u>
		lay hold upon every good thing</u>, and condemn it not, ye certainly 
		will be a child of Christâ (emphasis added) (Moroni 7:19).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âEvery good thingâ is not a specific list common 
		for all people.&nbsp; As we each search diligently, we find âall things which 
		are good cometh of Christâ (Moroni 7:24), Yet the manifestations of 
		âevery good thingâ are as wonderfully individual and diverse as our 
		varied lives.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The seventh chapter of Moroni tells how to 
		determine good and evil â in essence, what to let go of and what to hold 
		onto.&nbsp; It reminds us âby faith, they did lay hold upon every good thingâ 
		(Moroni 7:25).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Hold onto every good thing.</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The scriptures beckon âcome unto Christ, and <i>lay 
		hold upon every good</i> <i>gift</i>â¦â (Moroni 10:30; italics added). 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Good gifts come from Christ to every man and woman to bless others.&nbsp; 
		(D&amp;C 46:11-27; 1 Cor. 12:1-31; Moroni 10:8-19).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since every good gift comes from Christ, we become 
		more like Him as we use spiritual gifts to bless others and as lose our 
		natural selves by learning to serve as He does.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Spencer W. Kimball taught, âWe become 
		more substantive as we serve othersâindeed, it is easier to âfindâ 
		ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!â<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="1">4</font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Hold onto every good gift.</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One way I try to hold onto the word of God, every 
		good thing, and every good gift is to look for and record impressions 
		and experiences of each in my personal journal.&nbsp; That helps me seek more 
		earnestly and hold onto all.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>A Saving Gospel Principle</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The experiences of the window washer in Hawaii and 
		the father who let go of hate for his sonâs murderer illustrate a saving 
		gospel principle.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is this.&nbsp; We may not be able to hold on or let 
		go to save ourselves, but we may be able to hold on or let go because we 
		love others and feel our Saviorâs love.&nbsp; &nbsp;Love for others and our 
		Saviorâs love give courage, determination, and strength beyond our own.&nbsp;
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Letâs briefly explore the seeming paradox that, 
		âYou canât love yourself enough to save yourself.â &nbsp;&nbsp;This seems 
		contradictory, counterintuitive.&nbsp; Arenât we responsible to work out our 
		own salvation?&nbsp; Perhaps we think, âNo one can look out for me better 
		than I can for myself.â&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But it isnât true.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because the power is not within us to save 
		ourselves.&nbsp; We literally canât love ourselves enough to save 
		ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One dictionary lists 138 examples involving âself.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many âselfâ words carry negative connotations, 
		especially âselfâ words involving gospel principles like 
		âself-righteous,â âself-justification,â or âself-serving.â&nbsp; Intuitively 
		we know righteousness, justification, and service are about others, not 
		about self.&nbsp; Priesthood blessings are given by placing hands on the 
		heads of others, not on our own heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âSelf-sacrificeâ is only a virtue when we are not 
		âselfishâ but âselflessâ â literally having âless,â having let go of, 
		âself.â&nbsp; Similarly, while sometimes useful, self-appointed 
		self-improvement may help less than allowing His knowledge and love to 
		transform us.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Paradoxical, isnât it, that sometimes in letting go 
		we discover what to hold onto?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes we joke, âIâm at the end of my rope; I 
		canât hold on any longer.â&nbsp; In the extremities of our greatest 
		challenges, we learn the most about holding on and letting go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One extremity occurs at the end of life.&nbsp; Many 
		precious family experiences tell how we help each other hold on and let 
		go at those tender times.&nbsp; Here is one our family holds dear.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After joining the Church, my mother became a young 
		BYU student in Provo.&nbsp; She stayed with the family of Gerrit de Jong, 
		Jr.&nbsp; An accomplished composer and linguist from Amsterdam, Gerrit de 
		Jong served many years as a temple sealer.&nbsp; He would kindly ask those 
		attending the temple, perhaps nervous at being there for the first time 
		â would you like me to perform your sealing in English, Dutch, German, 
		Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, or perhaps some other language?&nbsp;
		</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By affection, our family called Gerrit de Jong 
		Grandpa de Jong and his wonderful wife Thelma Grandma de Jong.&nbsp; I became 
		a namesake of Gerrit de Jong.&nbsp; Because of him, I am the only person I 
		know with a Dutch first name, an American middle name, and a Chinese 
		last name.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We enjoyed many Sunday dinners with Grandpa and 
		Grandma.&nbsp; No meal was complete until we had finished the homemade banana 
		cream pie and laughed as we together washed and put the dishes away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Grandpaâs physical body deteriorated toward the end 
		of his rich and full life.&nbsp; He suffered excruciating pain.&nbsp; It hurt so 
		much he wanted to die.&nbsp; But Grandma was not ready to let him go.&nbsp; 
		Despite his great pain, Grandpa determined he would hold on for 
		Grandma.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally Grandma was able to find peace.&nbsp; She said, 
		âI patted his cheek, and told him I would be all right.&nbsp; I let him go.â&nbsp; 
		Shortly thereafter, Grandpa peacefully moved on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here is another family experience which taught me 
		about holding on and letting go.&nbsp; It too is quite personal.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Susan and I courted from two different continents.&nbsp; 
		She was teaching in Provo.&nbsp; I was trying to study at Oxford University 
		in England while learning everything I could about her from across the 
		Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; Call it âdistance educationâ of the best kind.&nbsp; Itâs 
		one reason I can honestly say I earned a Ph.D. in International 
		Relations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One school term, I made the mistake of trying out 
		for crew â the college rowing team â while everyday falling more in love 
		with Susan.&nbsp; The late afternoon sun sparkles on the Cherwell River and 
		makes Oxfordâs spires and lemon-lime fields glow.&nbsp; On a few of those 
		romantic fall days, the crew team almost kicked me off the boat for 
		daydreaming about Susan instead of stroking at the right time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both Susan and I sought spiritual confirmation 
		about marrying each other.&nbsp; But how could we separate what we wanted 
		from what the Lord might inspire us to do?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I prayed many times before I found the right way to 
		ask the right question.&nbsp; The question was not âShould I marry Susan?â â 
		that is, please tell me what to do.&nbsp; It was âI want to ask Susan to 
		marry meâ â please confirm this decision, which I have made with all my 
		heart.&nbsp; And the way to ask the question was to ask and then listen and 
		wait with full faith for the answer to come.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In seeking confirmation regarding marriage, Susan 
		and I learned that sometimes the hardest thing to let go is that which 
		we love or want to hold onto most.&nbsp; We learned that, by being willing to 
		put matters into the Lordâs hands after doing all we can, He will return 
		what we think we have sacrificed and much more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Doctrine and Covenants Section 123:17 teaches us 
		how and when to let go and hold on.&nbsp; It reads, âLet us cheerfully do all 
		things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the 
		utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be 
		revealed.â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please notice we are to do all things that lie in 
		our power, and do them cheerfully, which often includes gratefully.&nbsp; 
		Then we may stand still â with the utmost assurance.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We let go of doubts and fears.&nbsp; We express 
		determination to do whatever is right no matter personal preference.&nbsp; It 
		was then Susan and I found quiet, clear assurance.&nbsp; We felt our Father 
		in Heavenâs confirming love and direction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Our Saviorâs Example</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As always, in the life of our Savior we learn most 
		about holding on and letting go. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may know the Jewish literary practice of 
		âchiasmusâ matches and mirrors key ideas or phrases at the beginning and 
		end, and through, important scriptural passages.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whether âchiasmusâ or âbookends,â two remarkable 
		sets of paired experiences mark the beginning and end of our Saviorâs 
		life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Fishers of Men</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first involves fishermen and fishing.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Luke 5, at the beginning of his public ministry, 
		the Savior calls on Simon, a fisherman, to âlaunch out into the deep, 
		and let down your nets.â&nbsp; âAnd Simon answering said unto him, âMaster, 
		we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing.ââ (Luke 5:4-5)&nbsp; For 
		those of us who like to fish, we hear Simon say, respectfully but 
		clearly, weâve been fishing all night and there are no fish anywhere! &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simon has faith.&nbsp; Though no fish have been found, 
		Simon does not procrastinate.&nbsp; Simon answers the Savior, â<i>at thy word</i> 
		I will let down the netâ (Luke 5:5; italics added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And then the result.&nbsp; When they let down their 
		nets, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes.&nbsp; They beckoned their 
		partners in the other ship to come and help.&nbsp; Yet there were so many 
		fish that the fish âfilled both the ships, so that they began to sink.â&nbsp; 
		So great was their catch âtheir net brakeâ (Luke 5:6-7).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simon Peterâs astonishment speaks for us all:&nbsp; 
		âWhen Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesusâ knees, saying, Depart 
		from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lordâ (Luke 5:8).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now notice this chiasmatic bookend.&nbsp; The Saviorâs 
		earthly ministry is coming to its end.&nbsp; The disciples have seen the 
		resurrected Lord but He has not tarried with them.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And the chief apostle, Simon Peter âsaith unto 
		them, I go a fishing.&nbsp; They say unto him, We also go with thee.â&nbsp; So, 
		âthey went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night 
		they caught nothingâ (John 21:3).&nbsp; Again, there were no fish anywhere.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The morning came.&nbsp; Jesus stood on the shore, but 
		the disciples did not recognize Him.&nbsp; Jesus said to them, âChildren, 
		have ye any meat?â&nbsp; In other words, âhave you caught any fish?â&nbsp; âThey 
		answered him, Noâ (John 21:4-5).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jesus said, âCast the net on the right side of the 
		ship, and ye shall find.â&nbsp; Remember they had been fishing all night and 
		hadnât caught anything.&nbsp; But obediently they âcast therefore.â&nbsp; Now 
		âthey were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.&nbsp; Therefore 
		that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lordâ (John 
		21:6-7).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The disciples recognized a pattern they had seen 
		before.&nbsp; When the Lord first called them to be fishers of men, they had 
		fished all night and caught nothing.&nbsp; The Savior told them to cast their 
		casts again.&nbsp; The nets came back full.&nbsp; Now, before the Lord ascends 
		into heaven, He reminds the disciples of their previous experience -- 
		except for one important confirmatory detail. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, at the end of the Lordâs ministry, his 
		disciples again draw their net to land.&nbsp; It is full of many and âgreat 
		fishesâ â amazingly, one hundred and fifty and three fish.&nbsp; But then 
		this important confirmatory detail.&nbsp; Before, the miracle was so many 
		fish that the net brake.&nbsp; This time, âand for all there were so many 
		[fish], yet was not the net brokenâ (John 21:11).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those called to be fishers of men let their nets 
		out at the Lordâs command.&nbsp; They know their nets will come back full.&nbsp; 
		And they recognize the miracle may be a broken net or an unbroken net, 
		or both, as the Lord wills.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Taunting Torments</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A second set of chiasmatic bookends in the Saviorâs 
		life involves taunting torments.&nbsp; Taunting torments also remind us we 
		cannot love ourselves enough to save ourselves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the beginning period of his ministry, Jesus 
		fasted forty days in the wilderness.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then the devil came and tempted 
		Him with a taunting torment, âIf thou be the Son of God, command this 
		stone that it be made breadâ (Luke 4:3).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the end of his life, our Savior faced the same 
		taunt.&nbsp; As Christ hung in agony on the cross, those around him 
		tormented, âIf thou be the Son of God, come down from the crossâ 
		(Matthew 27:40).&nbsp; âIf thou be the king of the Jews, save thyselfâ (Luke 
		23:37).&nbsp; They even taunted, âHe saved others; himself he cannot save.&nbsp; 
		If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and 
		we will believe himâ (Matthew 27:42).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How interesting!&nbsp; Precisely because He was the son 
		of God, He had no need to change stones to bread or come down from the 
		cross.&nbsp; Precisely because He was lovingly working out salvation for each 
		of us, He did not save himself.&nbsp; He held on until all was finished.&nbsp; 
		Only then did He willingly let go and commend His spirit into His 
		Fatherâs hands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our Saviorâs example reminds us we can accomplish 
		things out of love for others that we cannot or (in His perfect case, 
		will not) do for ourselves.&nbsp; I believe our Saviorâs atonement was 
		perfect in part because He loved the Father and us more than He loved 
		Himself.&nbsp; Remember, in excruciating pain, He said, âFather, if thou be 
		willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, 
		be done.â&nbsp; (Luke 22:42) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The precious ordinances of baptism and the 
		sacrament help us hold onto the name of Christ.&nbsp; In always remembering 
		Him, we hold onto the word of God, every good thing, and every good 
		gift.&nbsp; Baptism and the sacrament also help us let go of the natural man 
		â including sin, rationalization, procrastination, stereotypes, and 
		misunderstandings of all kinds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Conclusion</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We end where we began.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you again for the privilege and pleasure of 
		joining todayâs devotional.&nbsp; I have felt your spirit, your goodness, 
		your desire to follow our Savior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In that spirit, may I invite you to do something?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may have felt a prompting today, perhaps it was 
		a renewed determination, to let go or hold onto something important in 
		your life.&nbsp; Will you please write that prompting down and begin to 
		follow its guidance in your life?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When an archer shoots an arrow, a small adjustment 
		here (near the ear) determines where the arrow lands.&nbsp; âOut of small 
		things proceedeth that which is greatâ (D&amp;C 64:33).&nbsp; Daily decisions 
		shape our eternal lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When our window washer in Hawaii fell, the rope 
		tore through his thick work gloves and into the flesh of his hands.&nbsp; I 
		wonder if his hands today bear any mark or emblem of the suffering he 
		was able to endure because of love.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our Savior reaches out to encircle each of us 
		eternally in the arms of His love and safety (2 Nephi 1:15; Alma 
		34:16).&nbsp; As He reaches to us, we see in His perfect hands the tokens of 
		remembrance that He held on until it was right to let go.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May we learn in the teachings of the scriptures, 
		prophets, and perfect example of our Savior to hold on and to let go, 
		and when and how to do each, I pray.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Light</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">C<span style="font-family: Times">hrist

<span style="font-family: Times">So how do you hold up your light that

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Times"><font color="#000080">And ye see that I

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>
<span style="font-family: Times">Come</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">The first step in holding up the 
		Light is to invite all in your circle of influence to come unto Christ.&nbsp; 
		That includes your family and loved ones and those you serve in the 
		kingdom, but it also means those who do not have the gospel in their 
		lives&#8213;friends, neighbors, people at work, the person sitting next to you 
		on the airplane. &nbsp;It means everyone who comes within your circle.&nbsp; 
		Invite them all to come unto Christ. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">Here are a few practical steps you can 
		take to invite those who do not have the gospel light in their lives to 
		come unto Christ. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">First, ask the Lord to put in your path 
		people He has prepared and then promise Him that you will speak to 
		them.&nbsp; When He does, take action.&nbsp; Talk to them.&nbsp; If you dont know 
		them, follow the 10-second rule: introduce yourself within the first 10 
		seconds of meeting someone.&nbsp; If you wait, it will get harder and harder 
		to start a conversation.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">Second, use the language of love to 
		bear testimony.&nbsp; I love the way my Church helps me&nbsp;. . . and then add 
		whatever the Spirit directs you to sayfeel close to the Savior, find 
		meaning in my life, strengthen my family, get the direction I 
		needwhatever the Spirit directs.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">Third, carry copies of the Book of 
		Mormon and pass-along cards with you.&nbsp; Invite people you meet to read, 
		to come to Church, and to meet with the missionaries.&nbsp; If you will pray 
		for opportunities and prepare yourself to share and invite, you will 
		have many wonderful experiences inviting Heavenly Fathers children to

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>
<span style="font-family: Times">Feel</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">When the Savior visited the 
		people of Nephi, He invited them to come and . . . feel the prints of 
		the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God 
		of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the 
		sins of the world.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">11</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		&nbsp;They came forward one-by-one and felt His hands and His feet.&nbsp; But they 
		also felt His presence, His healing power, and His love.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In a world that can be cold 
		and harsh, feeling the Savior is like feeling the light of the sun 
		breaking through the clouds bringing warmth, and goodness, and life.&nbsp;
		<span style="font-family: Times">When we do what He would do if He were 
		here, we help others feel His power, His mercy, and His love.&nbsp; When we 
		encourage with hope in Him, edify with His word, and serve with His 
		Spirit in our hearts, we help those we serve feel Him. </span></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">May I suggest two practical things you 
		can do to help others feel the light of the Savior? </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">First, always accept and 
		always magnify callings in the Church, and always volunteer to be of 
		service in the kingdom.&nbsp; If your bishop calls you to be the nursery 
		leader or the Scoutmaster or anything else, accept and magnify the 
		calling.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Second, when opportunities 
		come to take a meal to a ward member or make a visit to the hospital or 
		do any other kind of service, be the first one to raise your hand; be 
		the first name on the sign-up sheet; be the first one to stand up and 
		say, . . . Here am I; send me.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080" size="1">12</font></span></span><font color="#000080"> 
		&nbsp;If you do these things, those you serve will feel the Savior through 
		you. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>
<span style="font-family: Times">See</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">The people of Nephi saw the Savior with 
		their physical eyes.&nbsp; But, more importantly, He opened the eyes of their 
		understanding.&nbsp; They saw themselves as they really are.&nbsp; They saw the 
		redemption and hope that is in Christ.&nbsp; They saw the purpose of their 
		lives.&nbsp; They saw His gospel and the plan of salvation.&nbsp; In short, they 
		saw the truth through Christ, the light of truth. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: Times">You can bring the light of truth to

		will see that light because they will see truth in action in your life.&nbsp;
		<span style="font-family: Times">Here are some very practical 
		suggestions for putting truth into action: &nbsp;Wherever you go in life, 
		treat other people as children of God, with kindness and love.&nbsp; Be a man 
		or woman of integrity.&nbsp; Live the truth and stand up for truth, no matter 
		where you are.&nbsp; Be the same faithful person at home, at Church, at work, 
		in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Live your life whole.&nbsp; These choices will 
		illuminate the lives of people who see you in action because the light 
		of truth will shine in your life.&nbsp; Those with eyes to see will come, and 
		they will see. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I am delighted to be with you 
		on such a wonderful day in your lives.&nbsp; I congratulate you graduates, 
		your parents and families (and for some of you that includes spouses and 
		children), and the university faculty, staff and administration who have 
		made this possible for you.&nbsp; Blessings to all of you.&nbsp; As someone who

		is never a more joyful time than graduation day.&nbsp; You deserve to be 
		happy and I pray that you will beforever.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For my remarks tonight I wish 
		to comment briefly on the uniqueness of your experience at BYUIdaho, 
		and how that uniqueness is such a significant part of the larger 
		experience of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; To do 
		that I need to speak of the temple that is majestically rising on the 
		skyline overlooking this campus, for it symbolizes one-half of the 
		nature of your education here.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">You see, when the Prophet 
		Joseph Smith drew the plans for the ideal City of Zionplans which we 
		can still hold in our hands and review to this dayhe conceived such a 
		city as being anchored by two great symbolic structures.&nbsp; A temple and a 
		universitya house of covenant and a house of learning, two institutions 
		dedicated to the exalting of the human soul.&nbsp; As we know, tragedy 
		overtook the Prophet and the Latter-day Saints before this dream could 
		be fully realized in Nauvoo.&nbsp; But the dream came west when the Saints 
		came west, and in a few locations even now in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
		Century that marvelous concept of a house of learning and a house of 
		covenant joined together still exists.&nbsp; With this institution rising in 
		its mature stature as a four-year university even as the construction of 
		that temple on the hill rises with it, BYUIdaho and its host 
		environment here in southeastern Idaho becomes the newest of the Lords 
		experiments in attempting to create yet again a kind of Zion, or at 
		least the newest opportunity to show how the whole soul is edified when 
		a temple and a university join hands to bless a very fortunate student 
		community.&nbsp; In short, you graduates have hadand those students who 
		follow you still havea chance to continue the quest for part of the 
		Prophet Josephs dream.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But as exciting as that 
		soundsand it is truly an exciting concept to meI want you to know how 
		difficult it will be to really succeed, that it will be a harder 
		undertaking than you think, and that the trails of Church history for 
		nearly two hundred years now are marked by the strenuous efforts of 
		those who have gone before us, and who did so much to give us our chance 
		here in Rexburg today.&nbsp; Let me trace the trail of tears that marked our 
		early temples to make the point.&nbsp; I will conclude with what all that has 
		to do with this wonderful university, using the word commence and 
		commencement in a way that is unique to this student body and faculty.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The divine commandment that 
		led to the building of the first temple in this dispensation was given 
		in January of 1831 at a time when the struggling young church, less than 
		one year into the development of its destiny, was beset by poverty and 
		turmoil on all sides.&nbsp; The Church, as then centered in Kirtland, Ohio, 
		consisted of only a few hundred members, and all of them labored toward 
		the building and realization of this temple.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Ground was broken finally on 
		May 5, 1833, and one writer said that every man, woman, and child gave 
		brain, bone, and sinew, all living as abstemiously as possible so that 
		every cent could be appropriated to that grand purpose they had 
		undertaken.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Indeed the construction of 
		the Kirtland Temple was complicated dramatically with the call to 
		Missouri of Zion's Camp, taking virtually every able-bodied man on a 
		walking journey of 1,000 miles and leaving for all intents and purposes 
		only the older men, the women of Kirtland, children, and the infirm to 
		carry on the work of temple construction.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Of course, in addition to the 
		troubles in Missouri, were the threats and harassment by enemies of the 
		Church in and around Kirtland itself.&nbsp; Elder George A. Smith recalled 
		that &quot;sometimes guards attended the temple day and night, working with a 
		trowel in one hand and a gun in the other.&quot; Sidney Rigdon, then of the 
		First Presidency, recorded walking the walls of the temple &quot;by night and 
		day, frequently wetting the walls with his tears praying for the 
		completion of the temple.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Heber C. Kimball recorded:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">Our 
		women engaged in knitting and spinning, in order to clothe these men who 
		were laboring at the building; and the Lord only knows the scenes of 
		poverty, tribulation, and distress which we passed through to accomplish 
		it. (Whitney, Orson F., <u>Life of Heber C. Kimball,</u> p. 67.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To give the exterior a glaze, 
		a sparkling appearance, the women contributed their meager treasures of 
		china and crystal, watched them be broken into bits and applied to the 
		plaster.&nbsp; Their tears frequently glistened in the sunlight right along 
		with that beautiful surface.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In his dedicatory prayer, the 
		Prophet Joseph said to the Lord:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#000080">For 
		thou knowest that we have done this work through great tribulation; and 
		out of our poverty we have given of our substance to build a house to 
		thy name, that the Son of Man might have a place to manifest himself to 
		his people.&nbsp; (D&amp;C 109:5.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But just over a years time 
		later, the temple had been abandoned, falling into the hands of 
		apostates and excommunicants in Ohio, with even more severe troubles 
		facing the members in Missouri.&nbsp; The faithful efforts of the Saints to 
		establish Zion in these two early settlements seemed to have been in 
		vain.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So to some it may have been 
		surprising that not long after those difficulties, including his own 
		incarceration in Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph announced a new quest 
		for Zion in Nauvoo, including the building of a temple and plans for a 
		university thereafter.&nbsp; But this temple would cost a million dollars and 
		take five years to complete.&nbsp; Indeed by the 27<sup>th</sup> of June, 
		1844, with only one story of the temple completed, Joseph Smith and his 
		brother, Hyrum, would lie dead at the hands of a Carthage mob.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Even as the Saints mourned 
		the death of their prophet leader, they nevertheless labored to finish 
		the temple, which like its predecessor in Ohio was also doomed to 
		desertion and in the Nauvoo case, destruction.&nbsp; By the time the capstone 
		was laid, the city of Nauvoo was virtually abandoned.&nbsp; Its former 
		inhabitants, who sacrificed so much for its completion, were then spread 
		across the plains of Iowa, seeking and singing of yet another home far 
		away in the West, where none shall come to hurt or make afraid.&nbsp; Temple 
		building and establishing Zion had not proven to be an easy or entirely 
		successful endeavor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it was simply too much to expect.&nbsp; The 
		costs were high, the fatigue was great, and the sorrows were deep.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">So imagine their wonder when 
		only four days after the Saints had arrived in the Valley of the Great 
		Salt Lake, President Brigham Young marched to a center site, stuck his 
		cane in the ground and announced, &quot;We shall build a temple unto the 
		Lord.&quot; No one knew then that it would take four million dollars to 
		construct and forty years to complete, but they <u>did</u> know what 
		they had just been through.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Surely there must have been a 
		few in the congregation that day who heard that announcement for whom 
		the memory of Kirtland and Nauvoo was simply too fresh and too painful.&nbsp; 
		&quot;Why spend this time and this money, these tears and this labor to build 
		another temple we will only have to abandon?&nbsp; Surely this is too much 
		too ask.&nbsp; Surely this sacrifice is too great.&nbsp; Surely such a gesture 
		cannot be that important to the work of the kingdom of God.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Perhaps there were some who 
		had such thoughts that day.&nbsp; We cannot know, but presuming that a few 
		may have been so troubled and weary, President Brigham Young said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Some will inquire, &quot;Do 
			you suppose we will finish this temple, Brother Brigham!&quot; I have had 
			such questions put to me already.&nbsp; My answer is, I do not know, and 
			I do not care. . . .&nbsp; I have never cared but for one thing, and that 
			is, simply to know that I am now right before my Father in Heaven.&nbsp; 
			If I am this moment, this day, doing the things God requires of my 
			hands, and precisely where my Father in Heaven wants me to be, I 
			care no more about tomorrow than though it never would come.&nbsp; I do 
			not know where I shall be tomorrow, nor do I know when this temple 
			will be done. . . .</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This I do know&#8213;there 
			should be a temple built here.&nbsp; I do know it is the duty of 
			this people to commence to build a temple.&nbsp; <u>(Journal of 
			Discourses,</u> Vol. 1, p. 132.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I have traced that history 
		for you today primarily to capture that marvelous declaration by the 
		remarkable Brigham Young.&nbsp; Some things he didnt know, and about some of 
		those that he did know he didnt care.&nbsp; He didnt know exactly when the 
		building of the Salt Lake Temple would be completed nor exactly what the 
		final product would ultimately contain.&nbsp; He didnt know that Johnsons 
		Army would soon be coming, nor that the railroad would bring the world 
		to the Saints, even as they were trying to escape the world.&nbsp; Nor did he 
		know he would die some 15 years before the temple would be completed.&nbsp;
		<u>But he knew God intended that he and the Saints undertake this task</u>that 
		they could begin and be faithful and be true, even if they couldnt see 
		the end from the beginning.&nbsp; His concern was not with future vindication 
		but with present duty.&nbsp; I have never cared but for one thing, he said, 
		and that is simply to know that I am <u>now</u> right before my Father 
		in Heaven.&nbsp; If I am this moment, this day, doing the things God requires 
		of my hands, and precisely where [He] wants me to be, I care no more 
		about tomorrow than though it never would come.&nbsp; He knew that the 
		journey of a thousand miles, or ten thousand miles, begins with one step 
		and he put his shovel in the ground to once again build an anchor to the 
		city of Zion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Well, now lets shift from 
		the temple example to the university experience.&nbsp; That history of faith 
		and that spirit of determination and courage seem very much the moment 
		you are experiencing at BYUIdaho right now. For that matter it is faith 
		and determination and courage that has marked the history of this school 
		from its inception as a Church academy.&nbsp; But you have begun a newer, 
		bolder chapter in your history than ever before.&nbsp; What you are 
		undertaking here, and what you graduates have been blessed to be a 
		pioneering, ground-breaking part of, is virtually unprecedented in the 
		world of higher education.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are making your own inspired, 
		pioneering journey and you will have some Kirtlands and Jackson 
		Countys, and some Nauvoos along the way.&nbsp; Not every aspect of the 
		future goal is clear; for that matter not every aspect of the present 
		challenge about how to get there is clear.&nbsp; But everything about the BYUIdaho 
		experiment in education, just as with everything about that temple 
		rising on the edge of campus is a declaration of faith, a declaration of 
		sacrifice, a declaration of prophecy and purity and miracles.&nbsp; You have 
		been at this long enough to know that what you are doing here regarding 
		some aspects of both student and faculty life will require tremendous 
		faith and divine direction if it is to succeed as you and your Board of 
		Trustees want it to succeed.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">But what is so new about 
		that? The children of Israel have always undertaken quests, journeys if 
		you will, that have required tremendous faith and divine direction.&nbsp; So 
		as the modern bearers of that covenant heritage, I ask you to believe in 
		the virtues and values of the BYUIdaho experience.&nbsp; Indeed, to the 
		extent that I have a charge to leave with you graduates tonight, I 
		charge you to cherish what you have been part of here, to think about it 
		over and over and over again, and to take it into the world wherever you 
		gowhether that is to Ririe and Rigby or to Roanoke and Rio and Rome.&nbsp; I 
		charge you to tell your story wherever you go.&nbsp; Spread it far and wide 
		that you were part of something new and bold and creative educationally, 
		but it was newness and boldness based on the tried and true doctrine of 
		the gospel of Jesus Christ which is as old as mankind itself.&nbsp; Declare 
		that what you did at BYUIdaho mattered in the quest for a unique way to 
		teach and learn and ultimately live, that wherever you are you are <u>
		still</u> trying to be right before your Father in Heaven, doing the 
		things God requires at your hands, standing precisely where he wants you 
		to be, at least in part because of what you saw and felt and 
		experienced here.&nbsp; Think of Joseph, think of Brigham, and think of 
		Brigham Young UniversityIdaho.&nbsp;&nbsp; In so doing please know that the 
		future will roll into place for you and for this school just the way it 
		has for the other aspects of the Kingdom of God during the hundred and 
		seventy-six years of this Churchs existence.&nbsp; Congratulations on laying 
		the foundation of yet another latter-day symbol that has really only 
		just begun.&nbsp; God bless you to be grateful as long as you live for the 
		privilege you have had to be here at such a crucial, pivotal time.&nbsp; As 
		the Prophet Joseph prayed at that first temple dedication in Kirtland, 
		Holy Father, we ask thee to assist us . . . with thy grace . . . that 
		we may be found worthy, in thy sight, to secure a fulfillment of the 
		promises which thou hast made unto us. . . . (D&amp;C 109:10-11.)&nbsp; </font>

		Believe in what God intends for you personally and for this university.&nbsp; 
		If you will persevere as you have begun and be true to what LDS temples 
		and universities stand for, what Zion stands for, I promise you your 
		future will take care of itself and will be very bright indeed.&nbsp; As 
		Brother Brigham said, so say I with commencement application to you:&nbsp; 
		I do not know where I shall be tomorrow, nor do I know when this 
		university experience will be fully realized, but this I do knowthere 
		should be a great university built here.&nbsp; I do know it is the duty of 
		this people to continue as you have commencedto build a great 
		university unto the Lord.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>
