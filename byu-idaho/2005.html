<p>My brothers and sisters, I am so glad that Estella included me in her expression of greeting to
you.  My heart resonates with hers and the things that she told you.</p>
<p>On one occasion President David O. McKay said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God&#8217;s greatest gift
to man. . . .  Freedom of choice is more to be treasured than any possession earth
can give.  It is inherent in the spirit of man.  It is a divine gift to every normal
being.  Whether born in abject poverty or shackled at birth by inherited riches,
everyone has this most precious of all life&#8217;s endowment&#8212;the gift of free agency,
man&#8217;s inherited and inalienable right.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Free agency is the impelling source of the soul&#8217;s progress.  It is the purpose of the
Lord that man become like him.  In order for man to achieve this it was necessary
for the Creator first to make him free</i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, April 1950, pp. 32-33).</p>
<p>It is about this personal freedom that I wish to make comment today.  I pray for the Spirit to
attend and enable me to speak true doctrine and each of you to understand the same.</p>
<p>I have come to believe that in most cases this matter of freedom is more a case of capacity than
of permission.  When we are children we obtain our freedoms largely by permission.  We ask if
we can play.  We ask if we can have some ice cream.  We ask whatever it is that we might want
to do.  And if permission is granted, we then feel free.  But as we grow older, permission seems
to be less and less the instrument of freedom.</p>
<p>I will use an example familiar to many of us, and then I will leave it to you to generalize this
very narrow example to the larger experiences of life.  When I was a little boy, like many of you,
my parents arranged for me to have the opportunity to take piano lessons.  It was an opportunity
I did not wish to have.  I felt, in that period of my life, to do so would be a great impingement on
my freedom.  I did not want to practice.  I did not want to take the lessons.  And I suppose I was
not a very good boy.  I fussed about it so much that finally my parents relented, and I did not
take piano lessons.  I felt liberated.  I felt victorious.  I felt that I had asserted my agency and my
independence.</p>
<p>I did not think a lot more about it until one day many years later when I, as a man, sat in a stake
priesthood meeting.  On this particular occasion, a woman had been invited to sing a special
musical number to the priesthood.  She was a lovely lady and had a very beautiful voice.  She
presented herself in the meeting at the appropriate time.  But as she came to the front of the
chapel, it was clear that her accompanist had not arrived.  She, not becoming frustrated, simply
looked around.  As she did so, she identified in the very back of the room a man, a faculty
member at Ricks College.  She said to him, &#8220;Chester, would you please come and accompany
me?&#8221;  At the invitation, this great soul rose from his chair and walked to the front.  She handed
him the piece of music, and he sat at the piano.  He accompanied her to seeming perfection and
added much to the song she sang.</p>
<p>As I watched that happen, my mind went back to the time of my opportunity to learn to play the
piano&#8212;the one I did not take.  The thought occurred to me, &#8220;What if this woman would have
said, &#8216;Bob, will you accompany me?&#8217;&#8221;  I could have only had one response:  &#8220;I am sorry, but I do
not know how to play the piano and, therefore, I have no choice to make and, therefore, I have
not freedom in the matter.&#8221;  My failure to endure the process of creating a choice as it related to
playing the piano had left me without capacity and, therefore, in bondage to my own
inadequacies.  Armed guards could not have denied me any more effectively.  In that instance I
was free to do nothing.</p>
<p>I suggest that the freedom to do nothing is actually the greatest of captivities.  And so, the issue
really becomes whether we are talking about the freedom 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">from</span> things or the freedom 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">to do</span>
things.  My main interest as a child dealing with parents who wished me to learn to play the
piano was that I wanted to be free from all of the implications of learning to play the piano.  As I
said, those implications seemed burdensome to me.  I was not wise enough to understand that
those burdens would actually transform themselves into a great gift and a great joy and a great
vehicle of service.</p>
<p>Both the freedom from and the freedom to do are important elements of the full life.  There
certainly are things one would strive to be free from.  I want to be very clear about that, even
though there is no need to identify all or any of them here at this particular time.  There are also
arduous, challenging, and difficult things that we must do in order to acquire capacity.  One who
is wise might be willing, in order to be free, to subject himself or herself to those things.  The
scriptures can help us understand this concept.  I read from the second chapter of 2 Nephi
beginning in verse&#160;15:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created
our first parents, . . . it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the
forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. . . .</i></p>
<p>Parenthetically, it sounds as if He gave to man that man could do things, could be free to do
things.  Continuing the quote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . [he] gave unto man that he should act for himself.  Wherefore, man could not
act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other</i> (2
Nephi 2:15-16).</p>
<p>I take that to mean that only with choice can there be freedom.  We are not free by entitlement
but by the availability of choices.  And the truth of the matter is, ultimately, we create most of
the choices that make us free.</p>
<p>This seems particularly meaningful to me today in this setting, with you, at the beginning of a
semester.  You will all face the issues of arduous and challenging and sometimes burdensome
requirements that will be placed upon you in various settings and in connection with courses and
activities in which you will be involved.  A great point of sadness might well be if one were to
squander the moment and leave here with little capacity to do things&#8212;left only with the
temporarily sweet but souring memory of not having had to conquer obstacles.  There is a
moment of opportunity that comes in our lives, and it is within the framework of your time here
and at other places where you might be schooled that a significant amount of your life&#8217;s choices
will be established.  I hope and pray and trust that you will be what I think you are: wise,
prudent, and careful stewards of this moment that the Lord has made available to you.</p>
<p>From verse 22 of that same chapter, I continue the quote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he
would have remained in the garden of Eden. . . .</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurray!  Hurray!&#8221; some would say.  &#8220;That would be wonderful!  There would be no death. 
There would be no illness.  There would be no war.  There would be no worry.&#8221;  And somehow
they stop short of saying, &#8220;And there would be no freedom.&#8221;  The Lord said it for us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in
which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever,
and had no end </i>[in the state in which they were created] (2 Nephi 2:22).</p>
<p>Nothing would have changed for Adam and Eve.  There would have been no growth.  The
expectation and desire of the Lord that they would become more and more like Him would have
been frustrated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a
state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for
they knew no sin</i> (2&#160;Nephi&#160;2:23).</p>
<p>Free from everything.  Free to do nothing.</p>
<p>Some have erroneously concluded that the Lord gave conflicting commandments to Adam and
Eve&#8212;that he said, &#8220;Do not eat the fruit, and yet multiply and replenish the earth.&#8221;  In fact,
Heavenly Father was simply setting the stage for Adam and Eve to act for themselves&#8212;to be
free to do, to be free to choose.  It was clear in their minds, as we learn in other places, which
choice would please the Lord the most.</p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now this is the way I interpret that 
		</i>[account of Adam and Eve in the Garden]. 
<i>The Lord said to Adam, here is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  If you
want to stay here then you cannot eat of that fruit.  If you want to stay here then I
forbid you to eat it.  But you may act for yourself and you may eat of it if you want
to.  And if you eat it you will die</i> (Robert L. Millet and Kent P. Jackson, (eds.),
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Studies in Scripture, Volume Two, The Pearl of Great Price</span>, Randall Book Co.,
Salt Lake City, Utah, 1985, p. 93).</p>
<p>That is, you will die in the sense of being cast out of the garden.  In that case, you will be free to
do things&#8212;to have children, to have joy, to have misery, to do good, to know sin.  But that
condition had to come upon Adam and Eve by way of their choosing rather than by way of
imposition from the Lord.  If you do not partake, you can stay in the Garden and be free from
everything&#8212;including piano lessons.  If you do partake, you will be cast out and be free to
create choices.</p>
<p>I would reiterate that you now find yourself in perhaps one of the most fertile, productive times
of your life for creating choices.  As you grow older, as you marry, as family comes along, you
will find increasingly the energies of your mind and soul will be absorbed with the necessities of
life.  Saying this, I realize that many of you already work jobs&#8212;some, more than one job.  Many
of you are carrying tremendous loads.  Yet, in spite of all of that, there may never be a better
time for you to create choices which, in reality, become the foundation of our personal freedom. 
When one is engaged in the enabling process of education, there must be commitment to subject
oneself to the tough choices and discipline that in the end create capacity and opportunity.</p>
<p>As I think about how easy it is to treasure up and cling to the freedoms, the privileges and ease
of way that we value, I am reminded of a statement that General Dwight D. Eisenhower made on
one occasion.  Said he, <i>&#8220;A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both&#8221;</i>
(Davis Newton Lott, <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Presidents Speak</span>, Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1994, p. 306).</p>
<p>May I share one other thought about freedom.  As I have observed the happenings of the world,
particularly the happenings within the Church, over my lifetime, it has become rather apparent to
me that a freedom to be greatly treasured is the freedom to rejoice when it is time to rejoice.</p>
<p>You all remember the account in the fourth chapter of 2 Nephi when Lehi dies.  As his son
Nephi goes through the terrible anguish and pain of losing his father (and he makes it clear in
that chapter that he did go through such things), there comes a point when Nephi said, 
		<i>&#8220;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;when
I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; . . .&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 4:19).  I do not know of
anything sadder than a moment intended for rejoicing that is robbed of that by poor decisions
and poor choices.</p>
<p>Some years ago during a beautiful early fall evening, a young woman sat on a stone bench down
by the Spori Building.  At that time it was the original Spori Building.  And as this young
woman and a friend sat there talking and enjoying one another&#8217;s company (they had been dating
for some time), the young man brought himself to the point of saying to this young women, &#8220;I
have kept myself worthy my whole life so that I could ask a girl like you to be my wife.&#8221;  He
reached into his pocket and took out a ring, attempting to place it on her finger.  At that moment,
she became distraught.  She jumped up, placing the ring that he had tried to put on her finger on
the bench, and left him there.  She anguished about that for days and finally did what we would
understand to be the proper thing to do.  She went to her bishop and began the repentance
process.  It is what she said to her bishop that I think is compelling:  &#8220;What I could not bear to
tell him is that I was not the girl he thought I was.  But I wish to be.&#8221;  A moment intended to be
one of rejoicing had been robbed of its joy.  She had wished at that point, more than anything
else, to let the ring be placed on her finger.  To her credit she had too much integrity to do that. 
It certainly was a moment where she desired to rejoice, but her heart groaned because of her past
choices and decisions. </p>
<p>Conversely, I will tell you a brief story of a young man returning from a mission honorably
served.  He arrived at the airport and made his way to the baggage area where his family and
friends were waiting.  Upon seeing them, all of the decisions, all of the hard work, all of the
sacrifice, all of the disciplining, all of the obedience demonstrated during his mission came to
bear in a reunion most joyful.  One of the singular moments in life when one ought to be able to
rejoice is when returning from honorable service in the mission field.  Whether the missionary
returns to one who cares or a throng who cares is not the issue.  The issue is that he/she returns,
able to rejoice, because of the decisions he/she has made.</p>
<p>At times I think we worry overly much about what is required of us that seems to constrict
us&#8212;the Honor Code, speed limits, and curfews&#8212;thinking, perhaps, that every requirement or
expectation not of our liking constitutes a trespass on our agency and our freedom.  In order to
be truly happy in making our way through life, we will need to see the vicissitudes of the mortal
journey as essential elements in the equations of choice and freedom.  To do so will enable us to
turn them to our advantage as opposed to letting them embitter and discourage us. 
		</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I, like Paul, have been in perils, and oftener than anyone in this generation. . . .  I
should be like a fish out of water, if I were out of persecutions.  The Lord has
constituted me so curiously that I glory in persecution. . . .  If they want a
beardless boy to whip all the world, I will get on the top of a mountain and crow
like a rooster:  I shall always beat them</i> (B. H. Roberts, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">History of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span>, Volume VI, Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake
City, Utah, 1962, p. 408).</p>
<p>That attitude about difficult, challenging processes of life that ultimately create choice and
freedom is the ideal.  In the 122 section of the Doctrine and Covenants, Joseph is assured that,<i> &#8220;.
. . all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good&#8221;</i> (verse 7).</p>
<p>To experience life at its fullest is then to create choices, add capacity, and increasingly become
free to do things.  That it may be so for each of us, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</p>

<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters.  We are very pleased to meet with you today.  I want you to
know that as we look out over the audience, we think that you look wonderful.  We noticed. 
Thank you for how you have come prepared today to the devotional.</p>
<p>I would like to express appreciation for the prayers that have been offered in our behalf and for
the beautiful rendition of <i>Joseph Smith&#8217;s First Prayer</i> that has been played.  As I give my
message, you will understand how much it meant to me that they would choose that selection.  I
am grateful for the spirit that we have felt.</p>
<p>A few days after our sixth son Scott was born, we took him home from the hospital.  We were
greeted at the front door by our excited children.  I sat on the sofa in our living room and began
unwrapping the quilts for Scott&#8217;s brothers and sisters to meet him.  Five-year-old Amanda sat by
me.  As she saw her brother, she said, &#8220;Oh, mama, I am so excited.  Even though I have never
seen him before, I love him already.&#8221;  Even though we have not met many of you, we love you
already.  We pray for you, that you will be happy.  We pray that you will work hard, that you
will do your very best, that you will be safe, and that this semester will bless your life.</p>
<p>Thank you for being so kind to us.  Thank you for your &#8220;hellos&#8221; as you see us on campus and in
some of the buildings.  I am grateful for the administration, staff, and faculty.  Thank you for
your support and all the help you have given to us.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, Bob and I had the opportunity to visit the Smith family cemetery in
Nauvoo, Illinois, where the Prophet Joseph Smith Jr., his wife Emma, his older brother Hyrum,
his mother Lucy, and his father Joseph Sr. are all buried.  The cemetery is not owned by our
church.  It is a very sacred and beautiful place.  I will never forget some of the thoughts I had
while I was standing there paying respect to that wonderful family.  Those thoughts centered on
the remarkable contribution that the family of Lucy Mack and Joseph Smith Sr. made toward the
restoration of the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The picture of Joseph Smith kneeling in the sacred grove is familiar to most of us.  The results of
his prayer have been felt throughout the world.  Have you ever wondered what inspired a young
boy to turn to prayer when he was troubled and doubting?  Some have suggested that his mother
planted the seeds.  When Joseph was nine years old and his sister Sophronia was ten, she was
dying with typhus fever.  His mother wrote that she and her husband clasped hands, knelt by the
side of Sophronia&#8217;s bed, and poured out their hearts to Heavenly Father in prayer asking Him to
spare their daughter&#8217;s life.  From that moment, Sophronia improved and completely recovered.</p>
<p>Joseph also came down with typhus fever, and the infection spread to his leg.  Caring for her
children had drained Mother Smith, and she became very sick herself.  Hyrum took care of his
younger brother to help his mother.  He stayed with Joseph night and day.  He would hold his
brother&#8217;s leg between his hands, pressing on it to help ease the pain.  Joseph&#8217;s own faith and the
faith of his family helped him endure the terrible pain when the operation on his leg took place. 
Perhaps it was that time from feeling Hyrum&#8217;s loving companionship that Joseph and Hyrum
began a wonderful companionship and bond that lasted through the end of their lives.</p>
<p>Lucy worried about her husband Joseph Sr. and wanted him to join her in attending religious
meetings.  She often went to the grove of trees near their home to pray.  She wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I retired to a grove not far distant, where I prayed to the Lord in behalf of my
husband&#8212;that the true gospel might be presented to him and that his heart might
be softened so as to receive it, or, that he might become more religiously inclined
		</i>(Lucy Mack Smith, <span style="text-decoration: underline">History of Joseph Smith by His Mother</span>, p. 43).</p>
<p>When the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored, Joseph&#8217;s father became a faithful member.  Lucy
Mack Smith&#8217;s prayers were answered through the prayer of her son.</p>
<p>Think about the kind of home wherein Joseph was reared.  He saw his parents kneeling in prayer. 
He knew his mother went to the grove to pray to Heavenly Father.  The family read from the
Bible.  They sang hymns, and they discussed the scriptures.  The children were brought up in an
atmosphere of love and faith.  They worked together, and they had fun together.  There was
loyalty between the children and their parents.  After Joseph Smith experienced the First Vision,
he said,<i> &#8220;. . . I went home&#8221;</i> (Joseph Smith History 1:20).  He found his mother there.  He leaned
against the fireplace and began to share his experience with her.  His mother listened to him. 
She asked him questions, and she believed her son.  His mother shared in his sorrows, in his
suffering, in his persecutions, and in his success and joys.  She gave continued encouragement,
support, and strength to her son.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith Sr. was in tune with the Spirit too.  He knew that his young son spoke the truth. 
He, too, endured persecution and ridicule because of his son&#8217;s experience.  Yet he was
unwavering as he lovingly supported and defended his son.</p>
<p>Through the things that Joseph and his family suffered, they gained strength.  When neighbors
and friends ridiculed Joseph, he would always turn to his family and home for support.</p>
<p>Each of us is the product of the home where we grew up.  During the coming weeks, I hope you
feel gratitude for your home and family.  I encourage you to express appreciation to your moms,
dads, and others for their encouragement, support, and help in making it possible for you to be at
this university.</p>
<p>Now you are living in a new home and setting.  May you and your roommates or spouse create
the kind of home that Joseph Smith grew up in by doing the little things that will create an
atmosphere of love each day.  In a Relief Society meeting in one of the BYU-Idaho campus
wards, the sisters shared what they were doing to strengthen their relationships with roommates. 
Some were having personnel and family prayers every day, reading the scriptures together,
trying to eat one meal together daily, consistently attending their Sunday block of meetings,
attending the weekly devotional together, and keeping the commandments so the Holy Ghost
could be with them.</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 64, verse 33, we read:  <i>&#8220;Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.  And out of small things proceedeth that
which is great.&#8221;</i>  Do the little things each day that will bring an atmosphere of love and increase
the faith within your apartments and homes.  Our homes and apartments should be places where
a person can share their thoughts and feelings and find renewed strength to face the world.  Our
homes and apartments should be places where there is comfort, understanding, and acceptance. 
Our homes and apartments should be where best friends live and where we learn to be our best
selves.</p>
<p>What a remarkable contribution the Smith family made toward the restoration of the gospel of
Jesus Christ!  I know Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God.  I know we have a living
prophet today, President Gordon B. Hinckley.  I know our Heavenly Father and His son Jesus
Christ live.  I know they love each one of us.  I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</p>

<p>My beloved brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you again. I bring you the greetings of
President Hinckley and the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and especially Elder
Bednar. You are loved and you are known and you are trusted.</p>
<p>Each time I come here, I am struck by what seems to be continuous change. Many new buildings
now stand where once we looked across open fields. What was a fine junior college is becoming
a distinguished university. Thousands of students enroll who seem to be ever brighter and more
spiritual. They study in classrooms, some of which I saw today, equipped with powerful teaching
aids unknown just a few years ago. New faculty are choosing to join us who have remarkable
professional preparation and great faith in the restored gospel. The rate of growth in physical
structures will slow down, but spiritual and academic improvement will continue and will
accelerate.</p>
<p>Change is also accelerating in the world around us. Some of that change, like that in this
university, is for the better. But much of the acceleration in the world is in troubles long
prophesied for the last days. Each time you watch the evening news, you see stark evidence of
that. You remember this scripture: <i>&#8220;For behold, at that day shall he 
		</i>[meaning Satan] <i>rage in the
hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Nephi
28:20). </p>
<p>The Lord told us in the time of the Prophet Joseph that war would be poured out upon all
nations. We see tragic fulfillment of that prophecy, bringing with it increased suffering to the
innocent.</p>
<p>The giant earthquake, and the tsunamis it sent crashing into the coasts around the Indian Ocean,
is just the beginning and a part of what is to come, terrible as it was. You remember the words
from the Doctrine and Covenants which now seems so accurate:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause
groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not be
able to stand. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of
lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea
heaving themselves beyond their bounds. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men&#8217;s hearts shall fail them; for
fear shall come upon all people</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 88: 88-91). </p>
<p>Fear shall come upon all people. But you and I know that the Lord has prepared places of safety
to which He is eager to guide us. I think of that often. A few days ago, I heard two accounts of
God leading His children to safety on the coast of Thailand when that monstrous tsunami wave
struck. </p>
<p>One was of people who accepted His apparently routine invitation to a Church meeting on a
Sunday. The meeting was called by ordinary men who hold the priesthood of God. The meeting
place was on higher ground, away from the coast. The people who gathered with the Saints were
spared from physical death, while the places on the coast where they would have been were
destroyed. As they were spared physical death, they were being strengthened against spiritual
temptation and the wave of eternal tragedy it will bring to those who are disobedient.</p>
<p>The other account I heard was related to me by a Latter-day Saint who was led to safety by the
Holy Ghost. He checked into a hotel on the ocean front in Thailand the day before the wave
struck. He walked out on the beach. He felt uneasy. He went back to his hotel determined to
check out. The hotel staff, I think worried that he didn&#8217;t like the hotel, pressed him for a reason.
They only reluctantly agreed to his leaving. He moved to another hotel, away from the beach. It
was on higher ground. Because of that, he not only survived but stayed to serve the survivors.</p>
<p>The Lord is anxious to lead us to the safety of higher ground, away from the path of physical and
spiritual danger. His upward path will require us to climb. My mother used to say to me when I
complained that things were hard, &#8220;If you are on the right path, it will always be uphill.&#8221; And as
the world becomes darker and more dangerous, we must keep climbing. It will be our choice
whether or not to move up or to stay where we are. But the Lord will invite and guide us upward
by the direction of the Holy Ghost, which He sends to His leaders and to His people who will
receive it.</p>
<p>The mists of spiritual darkness will become more dense as we climb. They are described in the
Book of Mormon this way: <i>&#8220;And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which
blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into
broad roads, that they perish and are lost&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 12:17).</p>
<p>But the word of God will guide those who develop the capacity to receive it through the
ministrations of the Holy Ghost. A clear light piercing the darkness will show the way to those
who have taken the Holy Ghost as a trusted and constant traveling companion.</p>
<p>Now my purpose today is to share with you what I have learned over the years about getting and
keeping the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It isn&#8217;t easy, but it is possible.</p>
<p>The foundation is a burning desire to qualify for that gift. Most of us who are members of the
restored Church have enough faith to want the Holy Ghost at times. That desire may be weak
and intermittent, but it comes, usually when we are in trouble. For us to be led upward to safety
in the times ahead, it must become steady and intense. </p>
<p>The problem for most human beings is that when things go well, we feel self-sufficient. You
remember the warning:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;And others will he pacify, 
		</i>[again speaking of Satan] <i>and lull them away into
carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is
well&#8212;and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully
down to hell&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 28:21).</p>
<p>And later comes the warning:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall
hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power
of the Holy Ghost&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 28:31).</p>
<p>If you examine your own experience carefully and honestly, you will see that you tend to seek
the Holy Ghost most fervently when you are humbled by difficult circumstances or life-changing
decisions. Remember the time you faced the prospect of teaching the gospel as a missionary
perhaps in a new language where you couldn&#8217;t understand what people were saying and you
couldn&#8217;t put a sentence together. Or, remember a time you had to make choices that might lead
you toward, or away from, marrying someone. Those moments probably brought a great desire
for the faith and the capacity to get the help of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>But if we have to be in trouble to want the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, then to have
that steady desire we will have to be in steady trouble. There has to be a better way.</p>
<p>Happily, there is. Now you will have to find your own. I&#8217;ll tell you mine. There is one for me
that works: I choose to remind myself about my experience with what prophets have said about
the peace and happiness that comes with the visitation of the Holy Ghost. It has been true in my
life. Wilford Woodruff described it this way: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You may surround any man or woman with all the wealth and glory that the
imagination of man can grasp, and are they satisfied? No. There is still an aching
void. On the other hand, show me a beggar upon the streets, who has the Holy
Ghost, whose mind is filled with that Spirit and power, and I will show you a
person who has peace of mind, who possesses true riches, and those enjoyments
that no man can obtain from any other source</i> (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vo. 2, p.
199, Wilford Woodruff, February 25, 1855).</p>
<p>That has been true for me. One of the ways I know that I&#8217;m feeling the influence of the Holy
Ghost is that I feel a light and I am happy. When the Holy Ghost seems far from me, I feel a
darkness and I am not happy. I have felt that ebb and flow of light and happiness in my life and
so have you. </p>
<p>I like to feel of that light and I like to be happy. I don&#8217;t have to wait for troubles and tests to
make me want the help of the Holy Ghost. I can choose to remember what that companionship
has been like, and whenever I do, I want that blessing again with my whole heart.</p>
<p>When we want the Holy Ghost and the peace of mind and enjoyment that comes with it, we
know what to do. We plead with God for it in faith. It takes the prayer of faith to bring the
companionship of the Holy Ghost. That faith has to be that God the Father, the Creator of all
things, lives and wants us to have the Holy Ghost and wants to send us the Comforter. It takes
faith that Jesus is the Christ and that He atoned for our sins and broke the bands of death. With
that faith we approach our Father in reverence and with confidence that He will answer. With
that faith we close our prayer in the name of Jesus Christ as His true disciples, confident that our
deep repentance, our baptism by His servants, and our faithful service in His cause have purified
us and made us clean and worthy of the blessing we seek, the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>I have found myself setting a higher standard for my prayers for the Holy Ghost to guide me
because of the great examples of others. A favorite for me is in 3 Nephi. Jesus had chosen
disciples who would need the Holy Ghost as their companion when He was gone. Their example
lifts me every time I read it and could lift you: <i>&#8220;And they did pray for that which they most
desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 19:9). It
helps me to plead with more desire and faith when I read again the answer to their prayer:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;The Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
with fire. And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire; and it came
down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and did bear record&#8221;</i> (3
Nephi 19:13-14).</p>
<p>My prayers to receive the help of the Holy Ghost have been strengthened by pondering the
record of the scriptures. And so has been my ability to recognize the message which the Holy
Ghost brings. The scriptures tell us why that is so. The scripture declares: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of
Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the
words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it
will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought
into the light, but must perish in the dark. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive
the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do </i>(2 Nephi 32: 3-5).</p>
<p>I have found that is true: the words of inspiration from the Holy Ghost are words the Savior
used. When I read the words spoken by the Savior in the scriptures, I grow in my capacity to
recognize inspiration from the Holy Ghost. For that reason my personal scriptures tend to wear
out unevenly. I go most often to those places in the Book of Mormon, in the Doctrine and
Covenants, and in the Bible where the Lord is speaking. By doing that I can better recognize the
voice of the Spirit when the Savior&#8217;s words echo easily in my mind. </p>
<p>Just as pondering the scriptures invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost, so does doing the
things we have been told to do and doing them promptly. We are promised that the scriptures
and the Holy Ghost will tell us all things that we should do. When we go and do what we have
been told and do it the best we can, we qualify for more instructions of what to do. If we do not
act, we will not receive further instructions. My hero in this is the prophet Nephi, described in
the book of Helaman. He is my example for &#8220;Go and do.&#8221; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto
Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the
multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to
declare unto them the word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him,
concerning their destruction if they did not repent </i>(Helaman 10:12).</p>
<p>His immediate obedience brought him the companionship of the Holy Ghost, just as it will for
you and me. Here is the account: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into
prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them. 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to
multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all,
or sent it forth among all the people </i>(Helaman 10:16-17).</p>
<p>Now, there is a wonderful way in which all the things about which we have spoken work
together. Desire for the Holy Ghost leads us to the prayer of faith. Pondering the words of the
Savior in the scriptures increases our capacity to recognize the voice of the Spirit. The Spirit and
the words of Christ tell us all things that we must do. And as we do those things, we qualify for
further inspiration by the Spirit. And, in time, that companionship of the Holy Ghost changes us.
We feel the effects of the Atonement. Our desire for light increases, and so we pray with greater
faith that our prayers will be answered. The scriptures open up to us more clearly, our power to
obey becomes greater, and we are drawn ever upward, higher and higher, toward purity and
happiness and eternal safety (see 3 Nephi 27:20; Alma 19:33; 3 Nephi 9:20).</p>
<p>Now, all this has some practical applications for each of us. One is that we can repent and be
cleansed to qualify for the gift of the Holy Ghost. That makes us optimists. We can be forgiven
and be worthy to receive the Holy Ghost. With that gift, things will work out. The Holy Ghost
has a sanctifying influence. So, people can improve. Tomorrow will be better. We can have
rising expectations.</p>
<p>You can set the bar for yourself a little higher and then a little higher, again and again.</p>
<p>For instance, you returned missionaries can set your goal not to maintain the spirituality you felt
in the mission field, but to rise higher. That will take work and determination but you can do it.
Other people did some of your work for you, which you must now do for yourself. For instance,
the Church set the bar higher for the standard to become a full-time missionary. Your mission
president urged and lifted you to higher standards. Now, it is your responsibility to set the bar
higher for yourself, not once, but again and again. </p>
<p>That is true for all of us, not just for those who have been missionaries. The faculty of this
university face the daunting reality that here there will be perpetual education innovation. What
we have gone through was not only a transition from two to four years. It was a transformation
into another kind of university, where education will be constantly getting better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taught in such a place. In my ten years on the faculty at Stanford, I was blessed never to
teach the same course twice. I moved from field to field and changed every course I taught,
every time. I remember the nights when I was still working when the dawn came. I remember the
adrenaline pumping when I stood to face students with material as new to me as it was to them. I
know that I got help from the Holy Ghost. If that help came to me there, it will surely come in
greater power here. So, while I appreciate the challenge the faculty and staff face in this
university, I await the future with happy anticipation. </p>
<p>As the challenges around us increase, we must commit to do more to qualify for the
companionship of the Holy Ghost. Casual prayer won&#8217;t be enough. Reading a few verses of the
scripture won&#8217;t be enough. Doing the minimum of what the Lord asks of us won&#8217;t be enough.
Hoping that we will have the Atonement work in our lives and that we will perhaps sometimes
feel the influence of the Holy Ghost won&#8217;t be enough. And one great burst of effort won&#8217;t be
enough.</p>
<p>Only a steady, ever-increasing effort will allow the Lord to take us to higher ground. I know
what some of you are tempted to think: &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to be careful not to set the bar for myself too
high. I wouldn&#8217;t want to fail and be disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did a little high-jumping over a bar in high school and in college. I know what it is like to be
running toward the bar and see that it is higher than when you jumped last and that you are now
looking way up at the bar. Some of you have been high-jumpers so that you know that it is very
different when you come toward it so that you can look over it. I know what happens when you
look up at that bar. You think, &#8220;That bar is over my head. Is it physically possible to put my
whole body over a bar above my head?&#8221; As I look back, remember I was a physics student, I
realized that I must have decided that some law of physics limited me. Well, the laws of physics
did apply, but the limits were more in my mind than in reality. When I now see junior high
school students, some of them girls, jumping higher than my best, I wish that I were young
again. I&#8217;d set my expectations higher. More was possible than I thought, and more is possible
spiritually for you and for me. And more is necessary. Set the bar a little higher for yourself. And
then set it a little higher. In spiritual things you have a heavenly power lifting you beyond where
you are now. The Lord promises that unending rise in his own voice in the Doctrine and
Covenants: <i>&#8220;That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God,
receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 50:24).</p>
<p>You can set the bar higher for yourself to get more power of faith to pray for the gift of the Holy
Ghost. You can set it higher for yourself to have the scriptures opened so that you will come to
know the Savior&#8217;s voice. You can set it higher for yourself to be obedient in the things He asks
of you. And you can set the bar higher in your expectation for peace in this life and your hope,
even your assurance of eternal life in the world to come. You can set your expectations for
yourself a little higher and then a little higher, with confidence that a loving Heavenly Father and
His Beloved Son will send you the Holy Ghost and lift you higher and higher, toward Them.</p>
<p>I testify that God the Father lives and hears our prayers. He loves us. He loves His Son, our
Savior, and He loves those who love and serve His Son. The Holy Ghost is real and constant in
His service. I testify that the keys which unlock the gift of the Holy Ghost were restored through
the Prophet Joseph and are now exercised by President Gordon B. Hinckley. When the Lord&#8217;s
authorized servants say the words, &#8220;Receive the Holy Ghost,&#8221; I know that God honors that
promise, as we honor our covenants with Him. </p>
<p>Now as I leave you I would like to tell you something personal about you. I have been away
from here a long time. If you had told me that an institution and students and the faculty could
rise as high as they have risen spiritually in so short a time, I would have said, &#8220;It is not
possible.&#8221; Just as I used to wonder if I could possibly keep going higher and higher jumping over
a striped bar in a track field. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine where this University will be in just a little while. I pray with all my heart that
you know that I gave this message to you with a feeling of optimism, not of pessimism. I did not
plan to speak to you about the hard times that are ahead and they are real, and they are coming.
But as I prepared to come here I was given a feeling of light and confidence about you, that
somehow the people I would be speaking to today were special, brought here and chosen
because of your capacity to rise higher than you yourself would think even possible spiritually.</p>
<p>As I was preparing to come, I was awakened, I will even tell you the time of day, at 1:00 in the
morning. I had slept for only two or three hours and I think the Holy Ghost did it by telling me,
&#8220;You&#8217;re rested,&#8221; which didn&#8217;t seem reasonable at that hour. &#8220;It is time to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, I got up. In a period of five hours, when I planned to talk about quite a different thing, I
wrote what I have given you. I was surprised. I thought that this isn&#8217;t the kind of thing you talk
to young people about. You should tell more stories, or tell them something amusing, or try to
catch their attention. </p>
<p>But know you are special. Heavenly Father is inviting you upward, and you can move there if
you have the determination and the grit to say to yourself, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to be forced by
circumstances to seek the Holy Ghost.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be some private things that you need to repent of. There will be some things you need
to begin to do that you haven&#8217;t been doing. The Holy Ghost will tell you what those are and tell
you all things that you must do. And I have every confidence you will not be overwhelmed, that
Heavenly Father and the Savior will lift you up, and the Holy Ghost will be your companion in a
more constant and powerful way.</p>
<p>There is a God. He is our Father. He really knows us. He knows the future. I don&#8217;t know how He
knows it in such detail, but He knows the future. He knows every challenge ahead of you. He
knows every opportunity ahead of you. He knows your power and wants to lift you to every
opportunity and to be able to go through every trial that may be ahead of you, and to go through,
smiling. You will hear President Hinckley say, &#8220;I&#8217;m an optimist.&#8221; That is not just in his
personality, that&#8217;s a fruit of having the Holy Ghost as a companion. </p>
<p>I testify to you that the Holy Ghost can speak to your heart and your mind. And you can train
yourselves to know that voice in such a way that you might move away from the beach as that
man did in Thailand, or might be impressed to go to a sacrament meeting when you are on
vacation, as people did in Thailand. They could have easily said, &#8220;Well, we are on vacation.&#8221; But
no, they went to where the Lord wanted them to go. </p>
<p>You will be the ones who will be able to hear the voice of the Spirit, and it will bless you in the
times ahead. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters we're grateful to be in your midst. Ann and I were counseled years ago by
one of our great leaders that there are no great speakers in the Church there are only great
audiences. We know that this is a great audience, and the Spirit is here, and we pray that it will
be with us through all that occurs today.</p>
<p>A New York newspaper in mid-July of 1844 had a headline announcing the death of Joseph and
Hyrum Smith. The article concluded, "Thus ends Mormonism."
		<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPEndnote1', WPEndnote1 )">
<img src="endnoteicon.gif" alt="Endnote" width="16" height="14" border="0" /></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
 The assumption was if you cut
off the head, the body dies. So Mormonism was doomed. There have been equal and vehement
predictions since then that the Church would wind down and eventually be absorbed.</p>
<p>In contrast, in early 1834 a gathering was held in Kirtland, Ohio. Wilford Woodruff says the
building was a log cabin maybe 12 or 14 feet square, and that those who assembled were most of
the priesthood brethren who had been ordained in the Church. Among them such names as Orson
Pratt and Parley P. Pratt, Wilford Woodruff&#8212;a new convert, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball.
Each in turn bore a five minute testimony at the prophet's request. "Please," he said, "brethren,
bear your testimony as to what you see as the future of this Church." They did their best and then
he arose and said in effect, "I've enjoyed what you've said, but you no more comprehend the
destinies of this Church," one version is "than a little child on its mother's lap," and another "than
a babe on its mother's arm." If you follow the prophet's teaching children somehow have locked
into them great knowledge. But the point he was making was these leaders didn't begin to
comprehend the great and fulfilling destiny of the restored Church of Jesus Christ. Then he said,
"It will fill, eventually brethren, North and South America, and then eventually the whole
earth." <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPEndnote2', WPEndnote2 )">
<img src="endnoteicon.gif" alt="Endnote" width="16" height="14" border="0" /></a>

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
 Incredible.</p>
<p>After that, Parley P. Pratt went to Boston and spoke in a gathering like this&#8212;including many
nay-sayers&#8212;and said, in effect, "Do you understand that all dispensations are now gathering
together as has been prophesied, and in fulfillment of those who expected that all things will
come together in Christ in the last days. Untold millions will yet celebrate the day when this
Church was born." <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPEndnote3', WPEndnote3 )">

 In the same spirit, one of the three witnesses set apart and ordained Heber C.
Kimball to the Twelve. He said, "Millions will receive the gospel of Jesus Christ through your
instrumentality."</p>
<p>This year we have untold millions who will indeed celebrate. But we are only beginning. 
		</p>
<p>At the time they were given, these and like predictions seemed preposterous. But they are true.
And they have begun to be clear even in the minds of statisticians who study the Church and its
growth patterns&#8212;both conversions and births. So a sociologist named Rodney Stark up in the
northwest wrote a study for the one-hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the Church.
He estimated that at the rate then calculated that by 2080 the membership of this Church would
exceed 63 million. It would thus constitute the first major religious movement to occur in the
world since the rise of Islam. He was attacked in the press. His data, they said, was skewed, his
statistics were wrong. Twenty-five years later he acknowledged that he had been mistaken
because the Church has grown ten percent faster then he thought.

<p>The prophet Joseph said often to those close to him that he felt like he was shut up in a peanut
shell or in an iron case; that he so much wanted to communicate what the Lord had made known
to him, but felt he often fell short and that the Saints did not understand who they were, what
they were about, and the outcome.</p>
<p>John Taylor, one of the Twelve, spelled out later some of what he began to comprehend about
the huge or vast character of the restoration. </p>
<p>The prophet had said that he intended to "lay a foundation that would revolutionize the whole
world"&#8212;the whole world!

 He also spoke of himself as one of the instruments in the prophecy of
Daniel: a church, a kingdom would grow until it was so vast in its influence that all other
kingdoms would give way to it. Erastus Snow was corrected by the prophet once after he gave a
sermon and spoke of the "stone cut out of a mountain without hands" that would roll forth and
fill the earth. His sermon was essentially that it would crush all other kingdoms. The prophet
said, "No brother Snow. No. It will not be by sword or gun that this kingdom grows. It will be
like a spinning wheel, centrifugal in influence, reaching farther and farther throughout the
world."

<p>John Taylor says that the prophet used superlatives in every category of human growth and
development. He said the prophet taught that this Church was not just a set of individual
disciples, but a close community. The first generation was gathering, and he prophesied we
would have the most magnificent cities, the most beautiful homes, the most suitable gardens; that
we would have also the power to be increasingly intelligent, increasingly mastering the world;
that we would excel in the sciences and mechanics and manufactures. Elsewhere the same
President John Taylor cited the Prophet predicting, "You will see the day when Zion is as far
ahead of the world in all matters pertaining to human learning of every kind as we are now ahead
in matters religious."

 Likewise the saints would become the healthiest people, the most
prosperous people, the most blessed in all the creative arts. This people would be admired,
envied, and even those who observed at a distance would be in awe of the glory of the
movement.</p>
<p>Said President Taylor, "We believe, moreover, that God, having commenced his work, will
continue to reveal and make manifest his will to his Priesthood, to his Church and kingdom on
the earth, and that among this people there will be an embodiment of virtue, of truth, of holiness,
of integrity, of fidelity, of wisdom, and of the knowledge of God."

<p>His summation was, "All this to prepare this people throughout the whole world for the second
coming of Christ. For," said he, "Joseph Smith taught us that Zion from above&#8212;those who had
gone beyond, those who have fulfilled and come up though affliction the righteous
commandments of God, and who constitute what he called the Church of the First Born&#8212;Zion
from above will come and join the Zion on earth and thus introduce the glorious millennium."</p>
<p>The prophet anticipated more than numbers. Some people left the church because they heard
Joseph say things like, "We need numbers, we need growth." But Joseph also said, "It is not the
multitude of preachers that will bring about the glorious millennium. It is those who are called,
chosen, and faithful." Each of us needs to ask if we are called, and chosen, and faithful in
building the kingdom.</p>
<p>Now Joseph envisioned the Church, but also the establishment of the Kingdom of God, which is
more inclusive than just the Church. The Church is the nucleus of this last dispensation, but there
are good and honorable and faithful people according to the light they have throughout the
world. They too are part of his vision. So the Church is more than an ecclesiastical unit. It
is&#8212;and I name four areas&#8212;it is a social, economic, political, and educational kingdom. 
		</p>
<p>Someone said to the prophet, "You know among the critics and in the newspapers the standard
view is that the Mormons are all going to hell." Joseph replied, "And if we go to hell, we will
turn the devils out of doors and make a heaven of it. Where this people are, there is good society.
What do we care where we are, if the society be good?"

 So he introduced the pattern of
quorums, and auxiliaries, and relief society, and organizational tools. They make possible
fellowship, and brotherhood, and love, the bonding that is not found elsewhere in the world. Said
he once of that outreaching love,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">We ought always to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely
present themselves, and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends,
neighbors, and brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and
in matters of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is
between them and their God. There is a love from God that should be exercised
toward those of our faith who walk uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is
without prejudice [that is, it is not just that birds of a feather flock together. It is
divinely inspired love]. It also gives scope to the mind, which enables us to
conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards all that are not of our faith, than
what they exercise towards one another. These principles approximate nearer to
the mind of God, because it is like God, or Godlike.

<p>So it is a social organization, a set of quorums. "Where this people is, there is good society."</p>
<p>What about economics? From the beginning he introduced commandments from on high
expecting all members to live an economic law called consecration. When we failed at that, and
when it foundered on covetousness and greed, he was told in effect, "Start with the law of tithing
and let the people consecrate that much in returning to me what I have blessed them with." To
the degree that this Church has upheld the law of tithing we have flourished, and in those parts of
the world where the people still can't quite bring themselves to pay it, they have not flourished.
Pres. Hinckley was recently asked about how it is that we were able to build 100 plus temples
(not to mention 1,000 chapels per year), and how it was we could build a majestic Conference
center. "Who pays for these? How much is the mortgage?" asked Larry King.</p>
<p>"There is no mortgage."</p>
<p>"Well, then how do you pay?"</p>
<p>"Well, we pay in cash."</p>
<p>"Yes, but where does the money come from?"</p>
<p>His simple answer was, "the saints are generous in living the law of tithing."</p>
<p>A close friend in Boston, a minister of another faith, began to calculate how much the Boston
Temple would cost. "How can you do this,?" he asked. The local Bishop replied, "Let me put it
to you this way. In your church, as a minister, you are paid. In my church as a bishop, I'm not. In
my Church we pay tithing. In your church you do not. Does that help answer your question?"
Joseph prophesied that the saints would suffer much affliction and then go west to become "a
great and mighty people." That's one version, Anson Call&#8217;s. According to Mosiah Hancock, who
heard the same prophecy, (and by the way it was uttered many times, as early as 1834) Joseph
said they would become a great and <i>wealthy</i> people. Wealthy? Do you consider yourselves
wealthy? Compared to the rest of the world you are wealthy, and you have only in recent days
under the inspiration of the prophet contributed to others suffering terribly in the world [referring
to the tsunami disaster]. The humanitarian effort of the Church today amounts to at least 50
million dollars a year just in clothing and minimal supplies to others. "We believe in doing good
to <i>all</i> men," says our Article of Faith. Even those whom we don't even know? Yes. Economically
speaking the Church will continue to flourish as we continue to honor the laws of God.</p>
<p>What about political life? It has become Mormon common sense that somehow Latter-day Saints
will save the constitution. Several versions of that prophecy have an "if clause": If it is saved, it
will be through the people of the restored Church. Here too is the idea of extending and
expanding the powers of constitutional government. We are taught by Joseph Smith that the
Constitution isn&#8217;t just a good document (it can be improved no doubt), but that it is an inspired
document, and that the men who composed it were among the wisest of all the Father&#8217;s family to
establish the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Many sacrificed their lives, not
just their fortunes. Seeing it as an inspired document, Joseph set up an organization that would
look toward the day when such principles could be extended through the whole world. Whatever
others thought of our religion, they would come to cherish freedom. And not just freedom, they
would come to cherish the mode of life that preserves it. Because the question is, once you have
genuine freedom in the constitutional sense, what do you do with it? The prophet once said, "If I
were the emperor of the world and had the control of the whole human family, I would
		<i>guarantee</i> every man, woman, and child freedom of religion." Yes, he would. And the Nauvoo
Charter embodied that principle. You will live to see the expansion and extension of these
principles in other countries throughout the world.</p>
<p>What about education? One of the truth-gems of the Prophet is the understanding of intelligence
and that "a man has saved no faster than he gains knowledge."The inversion is also true: a man
gains knowledge of the kind we&#8217;re talking about&#8212;intelligence, light, truth&#8212;a man gains
knowledge no faster than he is saved, no faster than he embraces and honors the Spirit of God.
Well, the prophet looked to have a University in Nauvoo. It was barely on paper and started, but
look at the educational system that is expanding throughout the world today. How many students
are there in the Church of college age or more? More than 2 million and counting. When he was
in Harmony, Pennsylvania and almost starving, living with Oliver Cowdery on a barrel of
pickerel and using paper that was a gift from the Knight family, how could Joseph have the gall
to write (the answer: it is a revelation), "This generation shall have my word through you." This
mere boy is told "This generation shall have My word&#8212;the Lord Jesus Christ,
speaking&#8212;through you." Well, that manuscript of the Book of Mormon was put into the hands
of the Grandin Press and out came a first edition of 5,000 volumes. How many now have gone
out to the world? We are into the second hundred million. This book that confirms the essential
truths of the Bible, is filled with the light of Christ, his word. Educationally speaking, you and I
have the obligation to reach up for the sources that the Lord has made available.</p>
<p>Now, on to the question of the Zion pattern with temples. This is another of the mind-stretching
predictions of the prophet. He told Brigham Young, upon whom all of the keys of the priesthood
were transmitted including the keys of sealing, that there would be "hundreds of Temples on this
continent." He also anticipated&#8212;though he would not live to see the Nauvoo Temple finished,
which was one of his great sorrows&#8212;that we the Latter-Day Saints would return to Nauvoo. And
so we have. He taught that the main purpose of geographical gathering is to gain access to the
Temple. He taught that the Temples pull together the truth and the power and the glory of Jesus
Christ. We are to come in sacrificial faith to Temples. Therein Jesus Christ will manifest Himself
in mercy to His servants. His servants we are, and through the Temple we become His sons and
daughters fully, and ultimately His friends in the building of the Kingdom. Well, how many
Temples is one question, but another is where? Joseph saw that there would eventually be
"Temples to dot the earth."

 And through proxy service we would reach out to the whole human
family including the dead. Amazing, but it is underway.</p>
<p>Now, I move to another point having to do with the future. One could speak of several causes in
the world that seem, at this stage of history, utterly hopeless. What, for example, about the
middle-eastern crisis, as we call it? What will be the outcome of the Jewish people who have
suffered interminably at the hands of Christians and of others? What of other descendants of
Abraham? How can they be redeemed? How can Jerusalem be rebuilt and peace established?
Again utterly incredible. Yet in various ways each of those predictions is in process of
fulfillment. As early as 1831, when the Church was barely established, the Prophet wrote
prophetically: "And they also of the tribe of Judah, after their pain, shall be sanctified in holiness
before the Lord, to dwell in his presence day and night, forever."

 (I digress to say that
historically every man&#8217;s hand has been sooner or later raised against them). In the meantime he
gave this admonition from the Book of Mormon, Mormon speaking, "Yea, and ye need not any
longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel;
for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to
that which he hath sworn. Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the
Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he
hath made unto the house of Israel."

<p>We are of those in the world who expect that the terrible estrangements between Judah and
Ephraim, or between Judah and Ishmael, or between the contemporary representatives of the
various faiths in Jerusalem. We are among the number who have been taught by the prophet&#8217;s
vision that those divisions will ultimately be overcome, that there will be a family reunion, that
there will be power through Christ to forget and forgive the agonies of the past and to enjoy the
glory of fellowship and brotherhood. Some of the greatest disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ at
the end will be those who have hated Christians because Christians hated them.</p>
<p>But what about the huge numbers of people, the heathens so-called, those who have never heard
even the name Jesus, what about them? Well, I was once in a gathering where I was told there
would not be support for a proposal we made for a kind of multi-faith interchange. We as
Mormons would talk sympathetically and in the spirit of understanding to other Christians and
they to us. One man said "We won't do that because you people are exclusive in your outlook.
You are saying that you are the only true Church, and we can't stand that. We&#8217;re not going to
support that."</p>
<p>I asked the question "What about those dear people in China who have never heard the name of
Jesus, a billion and more of them?"</p>
<p>He said, and he said it vehemently, "They&#8217;ll be damned to hell with the other heathens."</p>
<p>I said, "That&#8217;s interesting. Our prophet taught us that every man, woman, and child who ever
lived will sooner or later, on this side of the veil or the other, hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ in
purity and in fullness and have full opportunity to receive it. Is that exclusive or inclusive?"</p>
<p>"We must,"said the prophet Joseph, "gather all the good and true principles in the world and
treasure them up or we shall not come out true Mormons."

 So, it isn&#8217;t just that eventually they
will have opportunity to hear the sacred truths we know, but we can learn from them for they
have had light and truth over the centuries, and the Lord has been working with them as well as
with us. That is the teaching of the Prophet Joseph&#8212;they will learn from us and we from them.
That&#8217;s the only hope, ultimately I am convinced, of attempts to get closer together among the
great divisions in Christendom and in other religions. Today they are talking with each other.
They have agreed to talk&#8212;councils, meetings, symposia&#8212;but they have not yet talked to
agreement. Someday through the powers of the gospel it will happen.</p>
<p>Well, now what about the billions more who have lived and died. Eighty billion we were told,
maybe more, have come and gone on this earth. Well, Joseph Smith&#8217;s vision didn't limit itself
just to them.</p>
<p>There are other worlds. Are other worlds inhabited? Yes. Worlds without number, we are told,
have been created by the Creator of this world, "whose inhabitants too from the first to the last,"
says the poetic version of section 76, "are saved," [meaning will be] by the very same Savior of
ours, and of course, "are begotten God&#8217;s daughters and sons by the very same truths and the very
same powers."So of every earth of which Christ is the Creator, He is also the Savior. The Lord
Jesus Christ said that, "Worlds without number have I created." Is this mind- boggling? Someone
said to me, "You know what&#8217;s wrong with the whole religious world is that they are earth-bound.
What we need is a theology for the space age."</p>
<p>Well, the last book Neal Maxwell wrote touches on that point. The title is 
		<i>Moving in His Majesty
and Power.</i> Where did he get the title? From Doctrine and Covenants section 88, which says that
the light of Christ quickens us both within and without and "anyone who has seen the sun or the
moon or the stars, even the least of these, has seen God moving in His majesty and power." We
have not just a global vision through Joseph Smith. We have a galactic vision.</p>
<p>People have inquired of me occasionally as they have noticed how I continue to study Joseph
Smith, "You seem to be preoccupied. All questions seem to lead you to say something about
Joseph Smith. When are you going to quit?"</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, my testimony to you is that I have been so taken with, so interested in, and
so desirous to master the life and teachings of the prophet for one reason only: that through him,
I learn more about Christ and my relationship with Christ than in any other source I can find all
the way back to the apostles in His own time. Joseph Smith is a window for me to Christ and the
clearest one I have ever found. That&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>That leads us to a few applications of what he taught us about the future. I am moved by his
insistence that no generation ever has been really exalted, saved, redeemed, or on the other hand,
condemned and judged without living testimony. Living. This is why we send out an army of
missionaries&#8212;one on one, one to group&#8212;living witnesses of living testimony. They have been
endowed and empowered in their souls by coming to the House of the Lord. These are His
witnesses. The name a &#8216;peculiar people&#8217; as it is used by Peter, and we pick it up in our own
language, the name &#8216;peculiar&#8217; doesn't mean odd or weird. (Although we've heard Steve Young
say, for one, that "if you don&#8217;t feel weird three times a day, you're not living the gospel.") It
means witness. A peculiar people is a witnessing people or a people who have been chosen and
selected by God, to give living testimony. It doesn&#8217;t come simply by osmosis. It comes into our
lives when we change our lives into harmony with Christ and with His will.</p>
<p>Again the prophet&#8217;s peanut shell analogy applies when he said, "My greatest sorrow is that the
people are living below their privileges." Yes, but privileges only come when we have fulfilled
duties, requirements, following a specific path step by step toward Him and into His likeness. So
the prophet Joseph manifested by his life what he was also envisioning. We are no longer living
in a full sense the law of consecration. We are no longer able to be a separate people building our
own community. That's impossible. We do have Stakes throughout the world in over 130
countries and counting. But Joseph the prophet lived all of the requirements through his life,
including the law of consecration. He gave his life in two senses. He gave his life by wasting and
wearing it out with incredible powers of recovery from endless opposition. But he also gave it as
you have heard this morning in the glorious hymn, [A Poor Wayfaring man of Grief] by dying in
the cause of Christ and sealing his living testimony with his blood.</p>
<p>When Brigham Young, first heard that Joseph was gone,(I think he was in New Hampshire) his
daughter, Vilate, said in effect, "I have never seen my fathers face so distressed, so anguished."
He himself said, "I want 30 days to mourn." On his own death bed he said one word three times,
"Joseph, Joseph, Joseph." A revelation he received in the aftermath (the saints were being driven
again) says toward the end, "Many have marveled because of his (Joseph&#8217;s) death, but it was
needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood."

<p>&#160;I don't know if I fully understand that, but I do know that I have marveled because of his life as
well as his death. And in that marveling, I have come closer to what it means to be a disciple of
Jesus. The Savior begins by asking us to make small sacrifices; He ends, if we are faithful, by
asking for our all.</p>
<p>It may seem a strange thing, but the glory of it is that when and only when we come to that point
in our lives, He then promises us His all, His all! Glimpses of His all are in the word 
		<i>fulness</i>
which recurs over and over in the Doctrine and Covenants. For example, the fulness of the earth,
is one of the rewards promised for honoring and keeping the Sabbath. The fulness of truth only
comes, He teaches, when we fulfill all of His commandments. The fulness of the Holy Ghost, is
promised in connection with the sanctuary (voiced at the Kirtland Temple dedication). The
fulness of the Priesthood, is promised again only to those who come together, husband and wife
and children, in the sealing and bonding of the Temple. And finally, the fulness&#8212;not a part but a
fulness&#8212;of the glory of the Father, is "a fullness and a continuation of the seeds forever," a
specific way of describing the glory of everlasting posterity like unto the Father and the Mother
who sired us in the beginning as spirits

<p>This is the vision of the modern prophet. This is the promise of the Christ that has come to us
through him.</p>
<p>Joseph was told "Your name shall be known among the nations, for the work which the Lord will
perform by your hands shall cause the righteous to rejoice and the wicked to rage; with one it
shall be had in honor, and with the other in reproach; yet, with these it shall be a terror because
of the great and marvelous work which shall follow the coming forth of this fulness of the
gospel."

<p>Just about every name you could think of, every mean and vicious thing you can say about
another human being, has been said of him. The foolish, he was told in the Liberty Jail,"shall
have thee in derision." So they have. But he was also told his name would also be known for
good. Yes, in two senses: for goodness, for all the good and true and beautiful things he
reintroduced in the world; but also for the permanent good in the hearts of those who know him
truly, and therefore the Master. So we are promised, you and I, that we can be among the noble
and the virtuous and the pure in heart who will seek counsel and authority and blessing
constantly from under His hand.

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Wilkes, BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho administration, staff, and students, I thank you for this invitation
and for the gracious hospitality we have always experienced when we visit this lovely campus. I
am humbled by the opportunity given to me today to speak at a podium that has been shared by
so many individuals that I admire and whose teachings and examples have touched my life. I
have earnestly prayed that my words will find an acceptable place among the words delivered
here by my betters. </p>
<p>I also must take a moment to thank my family for their desire to come and support me today.
With my husband, five of our children, a daughter-in-law, both my parents and both my parents-in-law here today, I feel we are not so much visiting your campus as invading it. While I can
never sufficiently express my gratitude for my wonderful family, I hope they will never doubt
my love for them.</p>
<p>These past few weeks, I&#8217;ve struggled to decide which of three different messages I should share
today.  Let&#8217;s hope this is the right one! </p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>The plan of salvation teaches clearly that this mortal sphere is a preparation for the next life.
Section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants more specifically explains that we prepare now for the
kingdom of glory we will inherit by virtue of the law we choose to obey:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a
celestial glory. And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot
abide a terrestrial glory. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial
glory </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:22-24).</p>
<p>Many years ago these verses caught my attention. It seemed clear that if I hoped to obtain a
celestial glory, I needed to obey celestial law. Since that time, I have thought a great deal about
what celestial law is and how it differs from terrestrial law and telestial law. Along the way, I
learned some things that I&#8217;ve found quite useful and that I hope will be useful to you as well. A
brief warning as I begin: some may consider what I say to be judgmental. It is. Those that are
bothered by the judgments to follow may choose to review the 7<sup>th</sup> chapter of Moroni where we
are reminded that </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>it is given unto 
		</i>[us]<i> to judge, that </i>[we]<i> may know good from evil&#8230;that 
		</i>[we]<i> may
know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good
from evil; wherefore, I show unto you to the way to judge; for every thing which
inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the
power and gift of Christ&#8230;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>but whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and
deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of
the devil</i> (Moroni 7:15-17, see also &#8220;&#8216;Judge not&#8217;&#8230;Unrighteously,&#8221; Elder Dallin
H. Oaks, BYU Devotional Address, March 1998).</p>
<p>The &#8220;Three Realm Model&#8221; that I present this afternoon is intended to be an aid in making correct
judgments, remembering always that the ideas discussed are not intended to help us condemn our
neighbors, but to help us evaluate our own decisions and to help guide our own life&#8217;s choices.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s consider this &#8220;Three Realm Model&#8221; and then discuss some of its applications. 
		</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Laws of Light, Outcomes of Glory</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>Telestial Law</i></span></p>
<p>Telestial law might be characterized as immediate gratification and appetite satisfaction. The
natural man is in charge. Individuals in this realm are completely focused on themselves and
their desires even to the exclusion of concerns about the needs or rights of others. Outcomes of
living telestial law include pain, violence, and destruction. Such outcomes may be physical or
emotional and are always spiritual. The pain, violence, and destruction are generally first felt by
those close to the offender. For instance, an abuser is living telestial law, but those he abuses will
be first to experience the pain. Eventually of course, the offender, having sown the wind, will
reap the whirlwind (see Hosea 8:7), but this may take some time, justice being promised at the
final harvest, not necessarily along life&#8217;s paths. Living with a telestial roommate is pretty
painful. They may consider your possessions to be fair game, they may borrow money they
never return, they may consider it their right to make noise even if you need to sleep, and they
may expect you to put up with their temper, their moods, and their mess.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: bold">Terrestrial Law</span></i></p>
<p>Terrestrial law might be characterized as self-control and deferred or delayed gratification.
Terrestrial living requires the harnessing of the natural man and it is through obedience to the
commandments of God, or even a willingness to comply with the basic rules of society, that we
are able to do that. These rules and God&#8217;s commandments require that we increase the strength
of our spirit over our flesh, controlling our appetites in order to refrain from hurting others and to
do what is pleasing to God. Of course, human appetites are not of themselves evil, but if left
unrestrained create enmity between us and God (see Mosiah 3:19) as well as making us pretty
tough to live with. Living terrestrial law brings at least external peace and safety. I think it&#8217;s easy
to see that if we control our desires, appetites, and passions, and those around us do the same, we
can have peaceful, safe lives. Terrestrial roommates, for the most part, don&#8217;t eat your food, don&#8217;t
take your clothes or car without permission, return things in good condition or replace them,
control their tempers, and do their fair share of the work. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>Celestial Law</i></span></p>
<p>Celestial law, I believe, can be defined as Christ-like being, as distinct from Christ-like behavior,
which can be found at the terrestrial level. If we have self-control and we can delay gratification,
we can behave like Christ, but we still are not <i>as He is</i>. In order to truly become as the Savior is,
our heart and behavior must be integrated. That is, not only do we <i>do</i> the right things, but we 
		<i>feel</i>
the right things. We are not kind because we should be and it works better, but because we see
people as God does and it is no longer in us to be <i>un</i>kind. The laws of God are not just observed,
they are engraven upon our hearts. Coming to live celestial law is a line-on-line, precept-on-precept experience, a process dependent on our cultivating a sensitivity to the tutorings of the
Spirit (see 2 Nephi 32:5). The outcomes of living celestial law are the peace that passeth all
understanding (see Philippians 4:7), and creation/rebirth. This kind of creation is not only a
reference to the future, when celestialized individuals will be able to participate in the same kind
of creative work that the Father does, but a reference to the birth of the <i>new creature</i> in each of
us (see 2 Corinthians 5:17, Mosiah 27:26), as we are born of the Holy Ghost and sanctified  (see
Alma 13:12, 3 Nephi 27:20). </p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: bold">Two Basic Three-Realm Principles</span></i></p>
<p>Now with the basic model in place, let&#8217;s consider two corollary principles. 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">First, we &#8220;can&#8217;t
skip&#8221; from the telestial realm to the celestial realm. </span>We must first establish a pattern of
obedience, achieving some consistency in our mastery over the natural man, before we can
progress to a celestial realm. Elder Bruce R. McConkie, speaking of how conversion comes
about, explained that in rare, miraculous cases, conversion is an event. But for &#8220;most people,&#8221;
Elder McConkie explained, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>conversion is a process; and it goes step by step, degree by degree, level by level,
from a lower state to a higher, from grace to grace, until the time that the
individual is wholly turned to the cause of righteousness </i>(&#8220;Be Ye Converted,&#8221;
		<i>BYU Speeches of the Year, </i>11 February 1968, p. 12). </p>
<p>I think an awareness of the &#8220;can&#8217;t skip&#8221; principle, can help us understand better some otherwise
confusing behaviors.  For instance, we might think that individuals living telestially are easily
recognizable as evil and dangerous, but that&#8217;s not necessarily so. Remember that appetites are
not always evil. They may include an appetite for fun, for generosity, or even, occasionally, an
appetite for the spirit and things of righteousness. Remember that a key element of the telestial
realm is that there is no consistent regulation of appetites. So, when someone who lives largely
by telestial law is in a fun mood, no one is more fun. When they feel generous, no one is more
generous. When they feel the spirit, no one seems more spiritual. A nursery rhyme that I learned
when very young goes like this: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">There was a little girl, with a little curl right in the middle of her forehead.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">When she was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad, she was
horrid.</p>
<p>Those in a telestial realm can be like that. Wonderful when they are wonderful and scary when
they&#8217;re not. </p>
<p>This &#8220;can&#8217;t skip&#8221; idea also explains what I call the &#8220;girls&#8217; camp syndrome.&#8221; Many of you young
women may have noticed that almost every year at girls&#8217; camp are some girls who seem to come
primarily to give the leaders grief. They break rules, they don&#8217;t show up when they&#8217;re supposed
to, etc. But on the last night of camp, at the &#8220;testimony bonfire,&#8221; they often bear testimonies that
seem quite sincere and emotional. They may say things like &#8220;I love my mom and dad, even
though I don&#8217;t usually do what they say. I love my sister, even though I treat her badly. And I
love all of you, even though I was a jerk all week.&#8221; You can see the puzzled expressions around
the campfire wondering if such expressions are genuine, not wanting to be skeptical but neither
wanting to be na&iuml;ve. Personally, I believe the feelings expressed in such moments are sincere
because the Spirit can touch anyone who is receptive. Nevertheless, in many cases, those
spiritually charged moments pass quickly and are not followed up with the &#8220;trenchwork of the
terrestrial.&#8221; </p>
<p>It becomes very important then for us to be able to distinguish between solid, consistent
progression toward the celestial and what we might term &#8220;the natural man on a good day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that celestial law does not <i>replace</i> terrestrial law as much as it 
		<i>builds upon the foundation
of terrestrial principles</i>. When Moses ascended Mount Sinai to secure a law for governing Israel,
he first received a celestial law. Of course, upon his return to camp, he found the people clearly
displaying their subjection to the carnal, sensual, and devilish appetites of the natural man.  The
Law of Moses was not a punishment, but an opportunity for progression, given as a
&#8220;schoolmaster&#8221; to help the Children of Israel acquire, if they would follow the law, a mastery
over the natural man. Those who diligently followed the law could then continue their progress
toward a higher realm.  Few in the Old World completed that path.  In the New World, however,
many of the Nephites, faithfully living the Law of Moses, were given the opportunity to progress
into a more celestial realm, coming fully to the Savior to be perfected in Him (see 2 Nephi
25:24-27). </p>
<p>We, too, can come fully to Christ by first subjecting ourselves to His commandments. Those of
you who served missions may have seen individuals who felt the Spirit, gained a witness of truth
of the gospel, and were baptized, but whose testimonies faded quickly because they failed to
consistently comply with basic commandments and harness the natural man &#8211; again, the
&#8220;trenchwork of the terrestrial.&#8221; It makes sense, then, doesn&#8217;t it, that obedience is the first law of
heaven (see John A. Widtsoe, <i>An Understandable Religion, </i>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1944,
51)?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The second corollary principle is that the telestial realm often mimics the celestial realm.
		</span>Satan is the master counterfeiter. &#8220;The father of lies&#8221; always seeks to deceive. Satan offers
telestial counterfeits for many celestial forms, but while the form may seem the same, the content
is diametrically different. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>A Few Examples</i></span></p>
<p>Systems of government illustrate this mimicry. Celestial government is theocracy. Until the
millennium comes, we won&#8217;t experience theocracy in a pure form. However, the Nephites, for a
time, were governed by a dynasty of prophet-kings &#8211; Mosiah I, Benjamin, and Mosiah II, an
earthly theocracy . Terrestrial government would include democracy or a representative form of
government. A dictator or an unrighteous monarch would be telestial government. Notice that
the <i>form </i>of a telestial government is similar to that of the celestial &#8211; one man at the top. The
		<i>substance</i>, however, is diametrically different. A dictator uses his power to control others to
achieve personal gain. A prophet-king consecrates his life to serve and bless his people, never
seeking to abrogate their agency.  </p>
<p>It is significant that when King Mosiah II was near the end of his righteous reign, he found that
none of his four sons wanted to assume the monarchy. He told his people that he would continue
as their king until his death, after which would be instituted a terrestrial government form,
elected judges, in order to keep the people safe from the danger of a telestial government in the
form of an unrighteous king. Let&#8217;s read from the 23rd chapter of Mosiah:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.166667in">
<i>If it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings&#8230;who would do
even as my father Benjamin did for this people&#8230;if this could always be the case
then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you&#8230;.
Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye
should have a king or kings to rule over you. For behold, how much iniquity doth
one wicked king cause to be committed, yea, and what great destruction! Yea,
remember king Noah&#8230;.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges&#8230;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to
that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that
which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law &#8211; to do
your business by the voice of the people.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the
time that the judgments of God will come upon you</i> (Mosiah 23:13, 16-18, 25-27).</p>
<p>King Mosiah, to protect his people from telestial mimicry of good government, instituted a
terrestrial &#8220;safety net.&#8221; </p>
<p>Economic systems also illustrate telestial mimicry of the celestial. The United Order or Law of
Consecration is the celestial system of economy.  A terrestrial economic system is our system of
free enterprise or capitalism. Communism, which mimics the celestial form, is a telestial
economic structure.  In the 1950s, some members of the Church thought that communism might
be the same as the United Order. Church leaders clarified:  &#8220;<i>Communism and all other similar
isms bear no relationship whatever to the United Order. They are merely the clumsy counterfeits
		<span style="font-weight: bold">which Satan always devises of the Gospel plan</span></i>&#8221; ("Message of the First Presidency," 112th
Annual Conference, April 6, 1942, emphasis added).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Three Realm Model Applications</span></p>
<p>As I consider these three realms of law and light, I find more and more ways to apply these
ideas. Today I&#8217;m going to suggest four applications that I think may be useful to you.</p>
<p>First, <span style="font-weight: bold">there is safety in the terrestrial, safety in obedience.</span> Several years ago I read a cover
story on one of the popular news magazines that reported on how many people had been killed in
one day in this country. They included small photos of most of the victims, with a short summary
of the circumstances underneath. I don&#8217;t recall many of the details now, but I remember being
surprised that while, of course, horrified at so much violent loss of life, when I finished reading
the article I was strangely comforted. I realized that while there were certainly some innocent
among the victims, the large majority had been involved in drugs, or in the commission of a
crime, or even in a few cases, some strange lovers&#8217; triangles. I remember thinking, &#8220;I don&#8217;t live
like that. And my family members don&#8217;t live like that.&#8221; Again, there are innocent people who are
sometimes hurt by an increasingly violent world, but there is great safety in following basic
commandments. </p>
<p>To extend this idea of a terrestrial &#8220;safety net,&#8221; let me talk about mate selection for a moment.
On many occasions, with single students or clients, I will hear descriptions of the kind of
individual being sought out as a future husband or wife. Descriptions include such characteristics
as, &#8220;She needs to have a strong testimony, or he needs to really love the Lord.&#8221; I can appreciate
the righteous desires expressed here. Faithful individuals desire faithful partners and seek to
marry someone with whom they can progress to the Celestial Kingdom. Nevertheless, given
telestial mimicry of the celestial, trying to find a celestial partner can be very risky. Celestial
characteristics &#8211; love, spirituality, true integration of the heart and behavior &#8211; are impossible for
us to measure accurately, as they involve deep recesses of the heart.  Some individuals seem to
have such celestial characteristics, but are later found to be very different from what they
appeared to be. We have been warned that there will be many wolves among the sheep in the last
days (see Acts 20:29; Matthew 7:15). May I also suggest that &#8211; wonderful as so many of you are
&#8211; for someone at your stage of life to have progressed to a consistent celestial level is  - shall we
say - unlikely? </p>
<p>Then, if seeking a celestial individual to marry isn&#8217;t realistic, what should you be looking for? 
Using terrestrial law as a safety net, you can choose a partner based on how firmly he or she is
planted on a terrestrial foundation. Terrestrial characteristics, consistent behaviors requiring self-control and deferred gratification, are rather easy to measure and are difficult to fake. For
instance, does this potential partner pay his/her bills?  Is he/she in significant debt? Can he/she
hold down a job? Is he/she often hurtful and offensive? Is he/she able to maintain solid
relationships and healthy friendships, or do they seem to leave a trail of injury and enmity in
their wake? Does he/she control temper and other appetites? Does he/she honor commitments &#8211;
attending meetings, fulfilling callings, doing home or visiting teaching? Remember that at this
stage we aren&#8217;t looking for perfection, but for solid consistency over time. It&#8217;s true that even
these behaviors can be faked, but counterfeits can&#8217;t &#8220;hold their breath&#8221; forever. Over time &#8211; and
please, my young brothers and sisters, <i>take your time</i> &#8211; it becomes fairly evident what kind of
mastery an individual has over the natural man. </p>
<p>We are fallible human beings. Just because someone makes mistakes or has weaknesses doesn&#8217;t
mean he or she is telestial. But red flags should go up when a pattern of telestial behavior is
exhibited over time. Some individuals seem to go from one crisis to another. They may explain
such crises in terms of coincidence, or unfair treatment, or bad luck, but no one has that much
bad luck. It is true that anyone can experience unfortunate or unfair circumstances, but if
someone is constantly &#8220;victimized&#8221; by such circumstances, a closer look often reveals that the
individual&#8217;s choices and behaviors are not consistently in the terrestrial realm.</p>
<p>For instance, I once visited in a counseling session with a young woman in her early twenties,
hurt and angry because her father had verbally exploded at her the night before. She asked,
&#8220;How am I supposed to feel any self-esteem?&#8221; With a strong sense of ill-usage, she told of a
friend working in law enforcement who wanted to prosecute her ex-boyfriend who had
introduced her to illegal drugs. She thought this was unfair and she felt responsible for her ex-boyfriend&#8217;s getting in further trouble with the law.  You see, this boyfriend had returned to
dealing drugs after serving a prison term for the same thing. In addition, he had kept all her
furniture the last time she moved out and, incidentally, had given her an STD. Yet she had just a
week previously contemplated moving in with him again, rather than stay with a new boyfriend
(not an ex-felon and with a stable job). </p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that this was a very nice young woman. She was attractive and could
obviously be lively and fun. She wanted to be drug-free and out of debt (&#8220;but how am I supposed
to pay my bills if I&#8217;m in a re-hab center?&#8221;). Those living at a telestial level are not necessarily
unpleasant or &#8220;bad&#8221; people. Nevertheless, they are allowing appetites and passions to govern
their choices and their lives. Eventually, the consequences start to pile up for them and for those
around them. While not a terrible person, this young woman was not a very safe candidate in
terms of potential for marriage or motherhood. </p>
<p>Not all prospective partners with serious telestial patterns are as easily identified. However, if we
don&#8217;t rush the courtship phase of a relationship, over time it usually becomes apparent when an
individual is too often governed by their appetites. As a marriage counselor, I have spoken with
many individuals who have lived with painful consequences brought into their marriage by a
telestial partner. Sadly, as they think back to the courtship phase of their relationship, they most
often say that the signs of trouble were there, they just didn&#8217;t give them appropriate weight when
making the decision to marry. </p>
<p>An awareness of the difference between telestial and terrestrial lifestyles can be a tremendous
tool in the mate selection process. Of course, presumably, as we recognize the great blessing it is
to have a terrestrial partner, we likewise develop in ourselves a consistent pattern of terrestrial
living.</p>
<p>Certainly, as a potential partner demonstrates a solid terrestrial foundation, it is important to
discuss our interest in working toward the celestial realm. If both partners are building on a solid
terrestrial foundation and both have a desire to progress, their potential to do so is real.</p>
<p>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold">in fulfilling stewardships, we must be mindful of avoiding the telestial counterfeit
of unrighteous dominion.</span> Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants gives a very strong
warning concerning stewardships, beginning with these familiar words, <i>&#8220;Behold, there are many
called, but few are chosen&#8230;.&#8221; </i>Continuing a few verses later: <i>&#8220;We have learned by sad
experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men as soon as they get a little
authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.&#8221; 
		</i>I
believe that one of the reasons that stewardship responsibilities can so quickly lead to
unrighteous dominion is that Satan, seeking to deceive, tempts those with authority into
counterfeit kinds of leadership &#8211; telestial mimicry of celestial principles.</p>
<p>For example, a scout leader may be called who, in his enthusiasm to fulfill his stewardship,
		<i>determines</i> that every young man will get his Eagle Scout award. This may seem a worthy
ambition, but &#8211; wait - whose plan was it that none should fail? It was Satan&#8217;s counterfeit plan,
rejected in the pre-earth council in heaven. It would have required that our agency be taken
away. Similarly, anytime we, in our stewardships, try to accomplish good by limiting others&#8217;
choices &#8211; even their choice to fail &#8211; we are falling for Satan&#8217;s telestial counterfeit of true
leadership &#8211; in effect, taking lessons from the loser &#8211; and effectively ending our potential to truly
bless or save. Efforts to <i>guarantee</i> Eagle status for every young man may result in an &#8220;Eagle
Mill,&#8221; with young men receiving rubber-stamped merit badges they didn&#8217;t really earn, and
parents and leaders completing projects or other requirements without much effort on the scout&#8217;s
part. Not only does this prevent the growth that should have occurred for that young man, but it
ends up making the award less meaningful for young men who really earn it. </p>
<p>The dangers warned of in Section 121 are an ever-present trap for the unwary foot: a Young
Women&#8217;s president who <i>vows</i> that every young woman will finish her Young Womanhood
award, a bishop who <i>determines</i> that every young man in his ward will serve a mission, a
husband who <i>is set</i> upon having a righteous family and is deceived into thinking he 
		<i>can control
or dictate</i> that outcome. All these need to remember that <i>&#8220;no power or influence can or ought to
be maintained by virtue of the priesthood&#8221; </i>or, may I suggest, by virtue of any stewardship, or
even by virtue of having a correct goal. Let&#8217;s suppose a young husband and wife are both
working before children come. Let&#8217;s say the husband wants to pay tithing on their earnings, but
the wife does not. He is right, of course, both should pay tithing. But if, in a sad fulfillment of
Section 121, he insists, &#8220;As long as I&#8217;m head of this family, we <i>will</i> pay our tithing,&#8221; well, he
was right a moment ago; now he&#8217;s wrong. </p>
<p>Recognizing how easily the telestial counterfeit can seduce those desiring a celestial experience
may help to keep us safe from substituting unrighteous dominion for inspired leadership or from
thinking the priesthood can be used as a cloak for compulsion or chauvinism. A favorite hymn of
mine &#8211; too seldom sung &#8211; reminds us: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;Know this that every soul is free to choose his life and what he&#8217;ll be, For this
eternal truth is given, that God will force no man to heaven. He&#8217;ll call persuade,
direct aright, bless with wisdom love and light, in nameless ways be good and
kind, but never force the human mind&#8221; </i>(<i>Hymns, </i>#240).</p>
<p>Third, <span style="font-weight: bold">a three realm perspective can help us be more effective parents.</span> There are too many
parenting applications of this model to discuss here this afternoon, but I can&#8217;t forego the
opportunity to suggest a few. Probably not very many of you are parents, yet, but I trust you can
file this information for future reference.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for you to understand that in these last days, as the wickedness in the world
intensifies, if you, as parents, do the same things your parents did, even if your parents were
great parents, it won&#8217;t be enough. A simple illustration: over the last couple of decades, I have
heard an increasing number of parents express frustration that their children treat them with
disrespect. &#8220;I would never have spoken to my parents the way my children speak to me,&#8221; they
complain. In a number of cases, these frustrated parents have gone to their parents and asked
what they did to command basic respect. These grandparents consider for a moment and then
consistently respond, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Of course, this just increases frustration. 
		</p>
<p>The three realm model can help us understand what&#8217;s going on. When the grandparents were
parenting, the world was more terrestrial. For quite a while, post-WWII, middle-class America
held pretty close to basic Judeo-Christian beliefs. This was reflected even in the television shows
watched by the rising generation: &#8220;Leave it to Beaver,&#8221; &#8220;Father Knows Best,&#8221; &#8220;Ozzie and
Harriet,&#8221; etc. In those television families, children spoke respectfully to parents. I remember an
episode of the Andy Griffith Show when Opie got mouthy with his teacher. The whole town
came down on him. Respect from children to adults was in the air we breathed. Not so today.
Popular children&#8217;s television fare now includes shows like &#8220;The Simpsons,&#8221; &#8220;Beavis and
Butthead,&#8221; &#8220;South Park,&#8221; and worse. I hope you and your children won&#8217;t be watching just
anything on TV, but even shows considered to be &#8220;safe family sitcoms&#8221; show a lot of disrespect
from children to adults, and a laugh track lets us all know how acceptable and even clever it is to
lace every conversation with zingers and put-downs. Today&#8217;s children and tomorrow&#8217;s children,
your children, will be breathing increasingly telestial air. </p>
<p>Parents in a telestial world have to parent more pro-actively than parents in a terrestrial world.
Society won&#8217;t teach your children to be respectful; you&#8217;ll need to do it. Society won&#8217;t teach your
children the difference between true, modest beauty as defined by God and trendy, immodest,
but increasingly popular behavior and attire; you&#8217;ll need to do it. Make a goal now to learn about
good, pro-active parenting. Passive permissiveness won&#8217;t be enough. Elder Maxwell once made
this sobering statement: <i>&#8220;I have no hesitancy, brothers and sisters, in stating that unless
checked, permissiveness, by the end of its journey, will cause humanity to stare in mute disbelief
at its awful consequences&#8221; </i>(Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;Becometh As a Child,&#8221; ENSIGN, May 1996,
68).</p>
<p>As a counselor, as a neighbor, as a citizen I am already seeing the fulfillment of this prophetic
warning.</p>
<p>Sometimes permissive parenting is an outgrowth of a misapplication of a statement made by
Joseph Smith. You may recall the Prophet&#8217;s answer to a question concerning how he governed
the people of Nauvoo:<i> &#8220;I teach my people correct principles and they govern themselves.&#8221; 
		</i>Quite
regularly, I hear of parents using this statement as a guide in their parenting approach. But this
statement doesn&#8217;t apply to young children  -- or missionaries&#8211; as President Hinckley&#8217;s son
Richard, a former mission president, added. There is a big difference between the citizens of
Nauvoo and the children who come into our homes. Referring to the Three Realm Model, how
might we characterize the citizenry of Nauvoo? Clearly most, if not all, Nauvoo citizens were at
least terrestrial. These people had certainly harnessed the natural man. They had already paid a
heavy price for their membership in the Church, enduring hardship and persecution and
reclaiming the land of Nauvoo from a mosquito-infested swamp to build the greatest city of it&#8217;s
time in that part of the country. Nauvoo, in fact, did not even have a jail &#8211;there wasn&#8217;t the need.</p>
<p>Now how do our little children compare with such a group of citizens? Well, they&#8217;re not really
the same, are they? We know little children are innocent, but when they come to our families
they are dual-natured: a spirit of great worth with divine potential cloaked in flesh, which from
the Fall of Adam has become carnal, sensual, and devilish.  Appetites of the flesh, if left
unchecked, can make us enemies to God (see Mosiah 3:19). So how much sense does it make &#8211;
really &#8211; to teach a young child about the value of education and then allow him to choose
whether or not to go to school? I would agree that our ultimate goal as parents is consistent with
Joseph&#8217;s statement, but <i>first</i>, we have a stewardship to help our children reach a terrestrial level
of emerging mastery over the natural man. Be aware that, as parents, we can and should 
		<i>teach</i>
celestial law, but we can only <i>enforce </i>terrestrial behavior. We can&#8217;t change their hearts, but if
their behavior is no longer offensive to God or their fellows, the spirit is able to work on their
hearts. Let me share an illustration. </p>
<p>More than one parent has told me of planning FHE after FHE aimed at getting their children to
quit fighting with each other, a telestial behavior. They felt good about those lessons, focusing
on the importance of love in their homes and love for each other, good celestial ideals. The FHEs
are successful, ending in a group hug, but five minutes after the prayer, the kids are fighting over
refreshments. Do you see the mistake here? The parents are skipping the terrestrial middle
ground so necessary to progression. It doesn&#8217;t work to stop quarreling children with something
like, &#8220;Johnny and Susie, you need to love each other, and I&#8217;m going to wait right here until you
do&#8221; because we can&#8217;t change their hearts and they can&#8217;t leap from telestial fighting to celestial
loving. Instead, we could say, &#8220;Johnny and Susie, I know you&#8217;re really upset with each other
(and frankly, I&#8217;m not too crazy about you, either, right now), but <i>you can&#8217;t hit</i>; 
		<i>you can&#8217;t break
each others&#8217; things; you can&#8217;t call each other those names,&#8221; 
		</i>etc. Do you see the focus on
harnessing the natural man as opposed to trying to change their hearts? Not incidentally, when
children are required to treat each other with respect and prevented from hurting one another,
their hearts can change and love can grow. </p>
<p>Discussing specific parenting techniques that enforce the terrestrial while still avoiding telestial
parenting patterns of compulsion or unrighteous dominion is beyond the scope of today&#8217;s
presentation and a subject for another time. But you will find and develop those skills if you are
committed to the task, learning by study and also by faith.</p>
<p>The fourth and final three realm application I would like to touch on today 
		is this:  
		<span style="font-weight: bold">it is
important to set appropriate terrestrial boundaries in our relationships</span>. This application
also has a lot to do with the idea of not trying to skip from the telestial to the celestial realm. Let
me explain. </p>
<p>If we are trying to be good people, and are earnestly seeking to follow Christ&#8217;s celestial pattern,
we may make sincere efforts to respond to injuries from others with patience, kindness, and
long-suffering. These can be appropriate responses to terrestrial troubles, but not always the best
response to telestial behaviors. The reason for this is that while terrestrial, imperfect behaviors
may be irritating, they are not destructive. If you have a roommate that watches too many sports
on television, or who doesn&#8217;t clean up often enough, or perhaps is too finicky about cleaning, it
can be a bit hard to live with, but patience, kindness, and long-suffering are certainly a good
approach and good practice for marriage.</p>
<p>However, as a marriage counselor, I see too many situations in which a partner is involved in
more serious, telestial behaviors &#8211; like adultery, abuse, addictions to drugs, alcohol, or
pornography. Of course, such behaviors bring pain, violence, and destruction into relationships
and should be confronted with strong terrestrial boundaries. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p>One woman told me that her husband &#8211; when he came home hungry and found her outside
watching the kids play &#8211; would go inside the house and lock all the doors, so she and the kids
had to wait for an hour or more on the back porch until he decided to open the door. While
milder than some marriage problems I just mentioned, this was still  a very destructive pattern. It
damaged the wife&#8217;s feelings of personal worth and it was destroying her feelings of love for her
husband. It also was lousy modeling for the children. Her response had been patience, long-suffering, and serious efforts to forgive, but it wasn&#8217;t working and she was becoming bitter. I
shared with her the three realm model and suggested that she was trying to skip from the telestial
realm to the celestial. She was responding to her husband&#8217;s telestial behavior with what she
thought were celestial efforts. However, showing patience with destructive, telestial behaviors or
trying to forgive unrepented, ongoing injury &#8211; typically results in an acceptance of victimization
that doesn&#8217;t benefit either victim or victimizer. The victim remains vulnerable to abuse and,
almost inevitably, loses respect and love for the victimizer, while the victimizer continues
unabated on their personal road to destruction. </p>
<p>Instead, I suggested this woman draw a terrestrial boundary with her husband. She agreed to
make sure she always wore clothes with pockets. In the pockets she was to put driver&#8217;s license,
cash, credit card, or checkbook, and keys. She also packed the car with extra clothes and supplies
for the young children. She then told her husband that she was no longer willing to accept
behavior that she knew &#8211; and he knew &#8211; was not acceptable to God. If he locked the door on her
again, she said, she would take the kids and go to place where they would be safe and not feel
like beggars at their own door  -- perhaps the library, a movie, a park, or a restaurant. Then,
when she was ready, she would call to see if he were willing to take this problem to the bishop or
to a counselor to learn better ways to deal with his anger. After she &#8220;drew that terrestrial
boundary line,&#8221; he never locked the door on his family again, and he came into counseling
where, working together, they made great improvements in their marriage. </p>
<p>The Lord has said, <i>&#8220;For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 1:31). This is not the statement of a harsh deity, but an affirmation of a
love so profound that it will give sin no quarter &#8211; knowing that sin destroys His children. If we
are to become<i> &#8220;even as He is&#8221; </i>(see 3 Nephi 27:27), then we, too, must be tolerant of individuals,
but intolerant of sin. </p>
<p>Notice, too, that this approach of &#8220;holding the terrestrial line&#8221; brings benefits to everyone.
Drawing a terrestrial line benefits the victimizer as this gives him or her the opportunity to
repent, rather than continuing on a path of self-destruction. And drawing a terrestrial line can
help turn victims into agents. This is vastly superior, of course, to what so often happens when a
victim reaches his or her limit and decides, &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken it long enough; now I&#8217;m dishing it out,&#8221;
at which point they both end up telestial. The Lord does not want His people to live as victims
(see Doctrine &amp;Covenants 98:23-48).</p>
<p>About 15 years ago, I bought a greeting card that I liked so much I decided to keep it. On the
cover it read: &#8220;A very wise man once said, &#8216;If you look through the rain long enough, you&#8217;ll see
the rainbow.&#8217;&#8221; Inside the card were these words: &#8220;And an even wiser man said, &#8216;If you&#8217;re getting
wet, get the hell out of the rain.&#8217;&#8221; Now there&#8217;s a clear non-victim message.</p>
<p>A serious caution must be given here. When a terrestrial line is drawn, there are two responses
that may follow from the offending spouse. One is that, as in the case mentioned above, the
partner backs down and makes efforts to improve in order to save the relationship. However, in
some cases, a partner too deeply involved in telestial behavior may intensify or escalate those
behaviors in an effort to force the other partner back into a victim role. So, we must never
encourage anyone to confront a partner without backup, if there is any danger of a violent
response. That is, don&#8217;t send a wife on her own to confront a husband who beats her up. She
must be accompanied by a male family member, or a priesthood leader, or someone who can
guarantee her safety, if necessary. </p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, I have addressed some serious issues with you, today. My intent
is not to frighten you &#8211; well, maybe just a little, enough to help you seek to 
		<i>&#8220;work out your
salvation with fear and trembling&#8221; </i>(see Philippians 2:12, Mosiah, 15: 26, Mormon 9:27). We
live in an increasingly telestial world. President Hinckley said just over a year ago,<i> &#8220;I do not
know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah&#8221; </i>(Worldwide Leadership
Training Meeting, January 10, 2004). </p>
<p>I sometimes worry that, as members, we are still responding as though the world were still in a
more terrestrial state, as it was in the 1950s or early 60s. I think some members became used to
only having to be &#8220;this much&#8221; better than the rest of middle-class America. Prom dresses, movie
or television choices, swimming suits needed to be &#8220;this much better. When the world began
sinking rapidly into an increasingly telestial state, I&#8217;m afraid that some members &#8211; having
become used to being &#8220;this much&#8221; better, just maintained that distance. Now, in this new
millennium, perhaps too often, our choices of are still just &#8220;this much&#8221; better than those of a
telestial world. Consider that if such a trend continues, all it means is that we&#8217;ll get to hell about
six months later. </p>
<p>We can and must do better. We can and must become increasingly different from the world, an
increasingly <i>&#8220;peculiar people&#8221;</i> (1 Peter 2:9), so we can one day become God&#8217;s 
		<i>&#8220;peculiar
treasure&#8221; </i>(Exodus 19:5). In this tremendous and essential effort, God will not leave us on our
own, for He has promised,  <i>&#8220;&#8230;I will go before your face, I will be on your right hand, and on
your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you
up&#8221; </i>(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 84:88). </p>
<p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is both &#8220;to comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.&#8221; It is
exactly what each of us needs. How generous is the Plan; how kind is our Heavenly Father; how
merciful is His Son, Our Savior. What a glorious opportunity is ours &#8211; what a tremendous
responsibility goes with it. May God bless you as you live solid terrestrial lives, moving forward
in faith toward celestial light and life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>In my soul there is burning a light of the knowledge of the living Christ. I feel blessed and
humbled to be invited to be with you at this time, so that we can share together the understanding
and blessing of this beautiful gospel.</p>
<p>In the book we call the Old Testament we read an interesting statement which has amazed me
since I read it the first time nearly 50 years ago. I don&#8217;t believe it would be an oversimplification
to say that this scripture may have become a catalyst for me to test myself, to see how I am
doing. Let me read to you Deuteronomy 28:47-48:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of
heart, for the abundance of all things;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee,
in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things; and he shall
put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.</i></p>
<p>What is this that we hear? Enemies?-hunger?-thirst?-nakedness?- in want of all things?-under a
yoke of iron until we are destroyed? Because of what?</p>
<p>Serving Him without gladness of heart and without joy. When I read this the first time, I
remember I was shocked and only when I put my mind to it, under the influence of the light of
the restored gospel, could I begin to see and understand it. When we come to this state of
awareness that we know that Heavenly Father wants to help us by trying to speak to us all the
time, we are beginning to come unto the road that leads to light and joy. When we are not filled
with this light, when the deep satisfying joy of being under the influence of the Spirit is not with
us, we are empty, and even our words and deeds are without lasting effect.</p>
<p>I want to share with you one experience that I had in the early days of my membership in the
Church that has helped me to become awake in a very dramatic manner. I became president of a
small struggling branch with a handful of faithful, reliable members, and a large number of
members who were completely inactive. I started my new calling with great enthusiasm and I
was convinced that I was the one who could make the difference. I worked hard and determined
to reach a goal to bring to life growing numbers of members and to become involved with the
missionaries so that through convert baptisms and reactivation, we could soon grow to the level
where we would become eligible to build our own chapel.</p>
<p>I started by working hard to have the attendance during our sacrament meetings improve. I
dedicated four evenings each week to visiting members, trying to instill in them a desire to
attend our meetings. As I had done this for several months in a row, I expected that things would
change. Every Sunday before our meetings began, I would sit in the front with high hopes that
our rented facilities on the 5<sup>th</sup> floor above a department store would soon be filled so that we
could expand our vision. Always I was disappointed. My expectations were not fulfilled. Week
after week I was sitting there realizing that nothing was accomplished. Everyone we had visited,
even when they had promised that they would come, disappointed us by not showing up. Finally,
on one day came the lesson I needed to experience in order to learn for myself.</p>
<p>It was Sunday and I was sitting in front of the congregation of my family and the handful of
faithful, true members, who were always present as the nucleus of our branch. I noticed that the
missionaries had brought a new investigating family, a couple and their little boy about four
years old. But none of the many that I had visited in the past week had shown up. I was just
about to start the meeting when something startling happened.</p>
<p>The little boy who was with his parents and the missionaries, sitting in the first row, just across
from me, started saying in a loud voice for everyone in this relatively small meeting room to
hear: &#8220;Mom, what is this man with this mean face doing up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was shocked. I was devastated. I was sitting there with the feelings of my own goodness, full of
pride, how hard I was working to establish our little branch, and here comes for their first visit a
new family with their innocent little child, and for that child, I&#8217;m nothing but a man with a mean
face.</p>
<p>That evening and the following night I found reason to search my soul, and under the influence
of the small but penetrating voice of the Spirit of the Lord, I learned a lesson.</p>
<p>This quiet voice frequently works with us so diligently by posing questions, such as: who do you
think you are? What is that that you try to do? Why are you not understanding? Why is it so
difficult for you to learn? Suddenly I became aware of what was wrong.</p>
<p>I saw very clearly what the first responsibility is for everyone in the Lord&#8217;s service: to make sure
that we are under the influence of the Spirit, so that we can radiate the love and light of Christ.
Anything that we do, when we are not under the influence of the Spirit, is eventually doomed for
failure. Everything we do merely out of routine, our own ambition, or in order to receive praise,
is doomed to fail. It will not bear fruit.</p>
<p>I needed to come to this level of awareness so that I could learn what to do, or how to be, in
order to become eligible for the light of Christ to shine in my soul. When we really believe in the
reality of the existence of Christ, we know that He came to the earth in order to bear witness unto
the truth: John 18:37: <i>&#8220;. . . To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I
should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>When we want to be on the same wavelength with Him we want to learn to become committed,
to become honest with ourselves. The more honest we become with ourselves, the more we
know how small we are, and how little we know. In so doing, we eventually enter into that stage
where, according to Christ&#8217;s words, we can be baptized with the fire of the Holy Ghost, as taught
in 3 Nephi 9:20: <i>&#8220;And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.
And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire
and with the Holy Ghost. . . .&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Since that time, I am striving every hour of every day to become aware of how it looks inside of
me and what message comes from my countenance.</p>
<p>Instead of sitting there and observing the negative, from then on I went with my family each
Sunday to the meeting expecting nothing from others. I planned in my mind the expectation that
we would be there all by ourselves. We would partake of the sacrament, give joyful testimonies
of the living Christ one to another, and would go home peacefully and satisfied. But of course we
were not alone. Others came and I could welcome everyone enthusiastically, filled with the joy
of Christ, member and nonmember, and suddenly everything changed. By and by, all the ones
who had promised to come and never showed up, finally came.</p>
<p>I could soon see that things began to happen that we have reason to describe as being miracles.
Yes, miracles began to happen on a daily basis. Miracles not only in the establishing of our
branch but also in my personal life, in business and family relationships and even in the issues of
personal health. In the area of our branch, our missionaries suddenly began to have success as
they brought new investigators on a regular basis. Many of our inactive members began coming
to Church meetings, and the Spirit of the love of Christ began to burn within the members of the
branch. We started having beautiful conversions on a regular basis. We learned to jump over one
obstacle after another. In a relatively short time we were able to build a full-size chapel, with our
own hands, in the most beautiful spot of our hometown.</p>
<p>I remember just one tiny little incident to show how the Lord spoils us, even in little details, to
strengthen our own awareness of the sacredness of this work. We were at the brink of building
our own chapel and we realized that we did not have many who understood anything about
buildings. We made it a matter of our focused prayers, and maybe not even to our surprise, we
were able to find and baptize an architect and an educated master bricklayer within the next four
weeks.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe that we as members are responsible for what we radiate from the depths of our
heart, and without these feelings of the love of the Lord we cannot heal or bless or do anything to
build His kingdom. We as members of the Lord&#8217;s restored gospel know that deep down inside of
us we are all searching and longing for that which embraced us before we came to this earth: to
feel the effect of the tender care of our Heavenly home, to be illuminated in all the fibers of our
being by His unconditional love.</p>
<p>Living now for quite some time close to the center stakes of Zion, I am overwhelmed by the
many wonderful, faithful brothers and sisters establishing the nucleus of the Church. I rejoice in
their goodness, their good examples, their willingness to serve, to sacrifice, and their willingness
to go the extra mile. I know, of course, how easy it is to get in the routine of things, to worry
about thousands of details that seem to be so important in the moment. I also know it can be so
easy to forget the weightier matters of the kingdom. With all our focus on the technical, the
organizational, the details of a program, sometimes we overlook the yearning of the soul to
become again embraced by the Light, to feel the fullness of His love.</p>
<p>I think it is time to remember that we are not earthly beings longing for some spiritual
experience, but we are spiritual beings, offspring of God, on a dramatic, but highly promising,
earthly journey. We have also to remember that we did not come to this earth to fail, and that we
can only succeed when we understand that we must never weaken the communication line with
our Heavenly Father. He has established a huge, perfectly-equipped organization to provide
connection with all of His children while we are in the state of our earthly probation. Everyone
has the right to communicate with the Highest Authority, the Creator of us all, and to receive in
the form of His small voice, His counsel and His suggestions. None of us will be able to function
in the full dimension of our potential unless we learn to understand that our spirits, our divine
entity, the real me, or the Child of God, is in urgent need to become 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">all the time</span> nurtured with
the essence of our life&#8217;s energy, the love of God.</p>
<p>Yes, we seem to receive this life energy as a kind of starting fund when we are young and still in
the phase of growing up, independent of whether we are members of His Church, or not. I
remember what happened when I first became aware of the full impact of this divine power long
before I could find the fullness of the gospel myself.</p>
<p>It happened in the Fall of 1944, several months before the end of World War II. I was forced to
take a train from my home town in Dortmund in the northwestern part of the country to find my
mother and my siblings. The panic of the upcoming defeat and the smell of desperation, fear and
pain was to be felt all over the country. The only train I was able to take in order to find my
family in northern Bavaria was driving a track line in the hinterland where still some
transportation on the track could function. The main tracks and bridges had been destroyed and
as you can imagine, the train was fully packed with people, like sardines in a can. As I managed
to get into the train and got a little bit settled, I realized that I was standing next to a young girl
and a young man, maybe 17 years old. To me, a 14-year-old boy, they looked like adults. I
became aware that both had a glow in their countenance. They radiated feelings of joy and bliss.
I could see that they were looking only in the eyes of each other, and they could not get enough
of it. The train began moving, and in time I realized that they were still standing the same in the
middle of all of this chaos, fear, and panic. They were standing in a chaste embrace, without
kissing, just looking into one another&#8217;s eyes. I realized that all the others who were standing
around were also captured with that phenomenon that overpowered these two people. They tried
as much as possible not to interfere with them.</p>
<p>After we had traveled for about two hours, the train was suddenly attacked by two fighter planes.
We came to a screeching halt and everyone was running out, seeking shelter the best we could.
Our train had, behind the locomotive, a flat wagon with a four- barrel antiaircraft gun. As soon
as they began shooting back, the two fighter planes disappeared, looking for easier targets and
we could move back into the train. I, being the first one to get back on the train, found in the
same place, in the same embrace, with the same blissful emotions in their countenance, these two
young people. I was overwhelmed. What kind of message was this for me?</p>
<p>There is the power from another sphere that is so beautiful and divine that all the things of this
world seem to disappear. What is war? What is destruction? What is hunger and thirst? What is
death, when you are filled with this beautiful gift of pure, innocent, divine love?</p>
<p>I became aware that there was a sacred power working within these two young people, that
everyone began to notice. I not only admired these two young individuals greatly, but I observed
that I myself was yearning for being embraced with the circumstances that would allow me to be
filled with this same love.</p>
<p>How little did I know at that time that I had just witnessed the universal divine power that every
human being is deeply in need of, and that only when more human beings are capable to become
the vessels to carry this divine energy are we on our way to build a new society, where people of
this world will be able to live in peace together, even with our totally different ethnic or cultural
or religious differences.</p>
<p>In my observations I know now that Heavenly Father seems to give the younger generation the
substance of this holy ingredient that we call the love of Christ, freely. I also know that when we
have grown older, to the age of maturity, we have to acquire this gift as our own achievement.</p>
<p>When I read the Bible for the first time I came across this scripture in Matthew where the Lord is
asked: <i>&#8220;Master, which is the great commandment in the law?&#8221;</i> (Matthew 22:36), and His answer
has not ceased to amaze me since.</p>
<p>What is the Lord saying? As an answer to this question, He says: <i>&#8220;Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind&#8221; </i>(Matthew 22:37). And in the
same way we should love our fellow man.</p>
<p>I had always assumed that love is something we have no control over. It comes and it goes.
&#8220;Sorry, I don&#8217;t love you any more.&#8221; This, or similar sentences, confront many in their lives. But
the Lord sees it differently. For Him, love is something we can learn to control. Otherwise, He
could not command us to love. With that understanding it becomes our responsibility how we
feel and what we feel, independent of our circumstances. In that way God wants to confirm us in
our state of maturity. He wants us to become aware of our responsibilities and stewardships and
that the first and foremost responsibility we have is to fill our heart with this divine love, or the
love of Christ, which is the only thing that can fill our soul with the deepest level of satisfying
joy.</p>
<p>So how do we do that, to fill our soul with love? In the Book of Mormon we find the answer. I
quote from Moroni 7: 47-48:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found
possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of
heart, that ye may be filled with this love, . . . .</i></p>
<p>The things of God are never complicated. What He says may be the simplest of all: when you
have identified what qualities you are missing, ask with all the energy of your heart and then you
will receive it. Jesus is also teaching us what the full quality of this divine love is, that we have
to learn to acquire. We read in the 5<sup>th</sup> chapter of Matthew, verses 43-46:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -1.5in; margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 1.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -1.5in; margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 1.5in">
<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate
thine enemy.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><i>
<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his
sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the
unjust.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the
publicans the same?</i></p>
<p>The love that mankind is usually dealing with is basically self-serving like: &#8220;because I need you I
love you,&#8221; or &#8220;because you are behaving well, I love you.&#8221; But Christ is challenging us to grow
into a totally different dimension. He wants us to develop the divine love, or the love that is
independent of conditions or circumstances. The Redeemer expects more of us. He wants us, as
His disciples, to grow to the level of that power that will enable us to become healers for the
wounds of this world. This love is also the only power that can heal the wounds that we may
have even in our own families and surroundings.</p>
<p>This love goes far beyond our own earthly understanding: loving not just the ones who are nice,
that love us and behave well, but loving even our enemies.</p>
<p>We may think that we have no enemies, but we have to remind ourselves that even members of
our own families or even our own spouse can have moments in our life where they behave like
an enemy. According to my experience, when people have earned love the least, they need it the
most.</p>
<p>To emphasize that what I just said, I feel I should share with you an experience that in a clear
way may help us to understand the power of that energy, which is the divine love: the love that
lets us go the extra mile and which is usually not in us in our mature age unless we have learned
to sacrifice by overcoming the natural man in us,and by having learned to ask our Heavenly
Father for it with all the energy of our heart.</p>
<p>In the first years of my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the
branches of the Church in our area were so small, and the members so inexperienced, that young
missionaries were acting as branch presidents. The members did not always feel comfortable to
go to them with their personal questions. One day I was approached by a faithful sister, about 30
years of age. She had a solid academic education, but she was very frustrated about the apparent
impossibility of finding a matching spouse. She asked me what I would think the purpose of her
life might be. I was a little bit surprised by this question and I&#8217;m afraid my answer may not have
been very convincing to her. Just a few weeks later, my wife and I were very surprised to receive
from this young woman a wedding announcement. She announced her upcoming wedding with a
young man whom we knew because he was a member of our branch. The reason we were so
surprised can be found in the fact that this young man was about ten years younger than she, he
had hardly any formal education, and he was nearly a head shorter than she. But we also knew
that he had a very good character and that he was very faithful to his baptismal covenants. So we
were glad and wished them well with a very happy heart.</p>
<p>A little more than a year went by and I was called, in the meantime, to be the branch president.
One day I was surprised by her desire to have again a private conversation with me. As soon as
the door was closed behind her, she started with heavy emotions to complain about her husband
with a sheer endless list of things which she didn&#8217;t like about him. She complained about things
like his lack of table manners, his smelling out of the mouth, his clumsy way of speaking, his
clumsy way of reading and writing, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>I saw her pain and her suffering and I saw what she wanted. She wanted me to tell her that under
the circumstances a divorce would probably be in order. I paused and I did not even need to
listen to the still small voice, because under the light of the understanding of the Restored Gospel
I saw marriage as something more sacred and with a much higher goal than we would normally
find it in the secular world. After a few more moments of pause, I calmed down enough to feel
prompted to say to her the following: &#8220;Dear sister, I have a couple of questions for you. Would
you feel comfortable to answer them to me?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Of course.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Question
number one: Do you believe in Jesus Christ?&#8221; And she answered with a strong, convincing,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; I came with my second question: &#8220;Are you true and faithful to your covenants that you
have made in the temple of the Lord?&#8221; Again she answered with a strong, convincing &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
Then I said, &#8220;How about your husband? Tell me about him. Do you think that he believes in the
Lord Jesus Christ?&#8221; Her answer was a little bit less firm, but it was clearly a &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then I came
to my final question: &#8220;Do you think that he is faithful to his covenants that he has made in the
temple?&#8221; Her answer again was in the affirmative, maybe a little bit less enthusiastic, but still it
was a clear &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a short little pause, I wanted to know whether she could remember our conversation from a
little more than a year ago, where she was asking me what the purpose of her life could be, and
where I could not come up with a convincing answer. She, of course, could remember that talk
very vividly. I suggested to her: &#8220;Could it be that the purpose of your life would be to bring this
fine husband of yours into the Celestial Kingdom? Could it be, that the Lord wants you to make
the necessary steps to qualify for receiving the higher vibration of divine love by overcoming the
temptation to see the negative, and instead to learn to focus on the hidden divine qualities that
are in all of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s children, but specifically with a person like your husband,
who according to your own words, believes in the Lord Jesus Christ?&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember that she was reacting as if she had been hit with a whip. Her face became long and
sour and she looked as if she had just swallowed a frog. Without saying another word she left the
room.</p>
<p>Soon after this I was called to serve in other capacities. Because of many hectic things happening
in my life at this time, I finally forgot all the details of this early event in my membership in the
Church.</p>
<p>Many years later, much more than a generation after I had my talk with this sister, I was with
Sister Busche visiting in Germany to preside over a stake conference. I was sitting on the stand
and I was impressed with the large audience filling that spacious stake center to the last seat.</p>
<p>Suddenly my eyes became glued to a nice elderly couple with an overwhelming glow of
happiness and joy on their faces. He was holding her hand in one hand and gently, lovingly
touching her hand with his other hand. On the left and on the right of them I could see children
and grandchildren, as it was not difficult to recognize them by their resemblance. Then, when I
noticed that he was much smaller than she, it suddenly struck me: my goodness, I know these
people. And the full memory of my talk with this gentle lady from so many years ago came into
my mind. My heart was rejoicing with the impressive awareness: 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT!</span>
Now I could see that she had made the sacrifice, that she had paid the price; she had overcome
the natural man inside of her, and had obviously learned to love him without conditions. He had
grown to become that impressive, gray-haired gentleman with aristocratic demeanor, and bliss
radiating from his countenance, a radiation that can only be felt from someone who has learned
to know God. And it was easy to see that now she would not give him up for anything.</p>
<p>I was filled with joy and I had reason to marvel about the beautiful gospel of Jesus Christ. He
watches carefully over us to teach us to live our lives in dignity, as we learn to understand and
develop in us the capability to be filled with that immense and overwhelming power of the love
of Christ. This is the power that will enable us to change the realities of this life so that even the
burdens of our life become easy, and our service in His kingdom becomes a privilege and a joy,
so that we will be able to serve the Lord our God with joyfulness and gladness of heart.</p>
<p>I bear to you my testimony, that I know from the bottom of my heart that Jesus the Christ is
alive. He is not hiding in old books. He is waiting for us to surrender our lives into His arms so
that He can be the Author and Finisher of our earthly time of probation. I say this in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am delighted to be with you this evening. Thank you, President Wilkes, for your kind
comments. Although I am honored to be associated with this award, I&#8217;m not sure that I have
completely come to terms with the nomenclature. To be honest, I feel some sympathy with
Benjamin Franklin who once was at a formal literary society event in Paris, France. Not
completely understanding what was being said, and not wanting to appear rude, he decided he
would follow the lead of a friend of his and applaud whenever she did. After the event,
Franklin&#8217;s grandson said, &#8220;But, Grandpapa, you always applauded, and louder than anyone else
when they praised you&#8221; (Clifton Fadiman and Andre Bernard, General Editors,
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Bartlett&#8217;s Book
of Anecdotes</span>, Little, Brown and Company, First Revised Edition, p. 217).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Over the span of my lifetime, I have had the remarkable opportunity to know and work closely
with many men and women who exemplify excellence. I have learned from each one of them.
They have served as guiding lights during my life and provided direction that has been an
immense help to me.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Polynesian Pilots</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Hundreds of years ago, Polynesian sailors traveled vast distances using only the stars to
navigate. To be able to launch a craft not much larger than a canoe, travel thousands of miles
through often treacherous waters, and find a tiny pinprick of an island in the midst of a vast
ocean is a remarkable feat to say the least. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That such a thing is possible was demonstrated by a group from Hawaii in the 1970s. Having
enlisted the help of one of the last remaining Polynesian pilots, they set out from Hawaii. Thirty
days and 2,500 miles later, they arrived at their destination - a group of islands near Tahiti
(http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/nainoa80tahiti.html).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How did they accomplish this remarkable feat? 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These navigators spent their lives learning about the stars and their paths through the heavens.
They had memorized them so carefully, that they were able to use them as reference points
throughout their voyage. Whenever they drifted off course, they looked to the stars and adjusted
their sails. As long as they followed the stars, they knew they would reach their destination. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">History is filled with the examples of righteous men and women who can serve as guiding stars
for us. Although they may have lived in different times and faced different trials, fundamentally,
their challenges are ours; the problems we face were theirs. The more we learn of them - the
more we use them as a guide for us - the more certain it is that we will reach a final destination
worthy of sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There have been many such guiding lights in my life. The examples and words of my mother and
father remain with me to this day. Many of the great men and women of my youth, in a similar
way, still are with me. I honor and revere them and thank them for the positive influence they
had on me as a young boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Although I never knew him, my great-grandfather is another example to me. As a teenager in
Berne, Switzerland, he heard the elders preach the restored Gospel. The power of testimony was
so strong that he accepted the Gospel immediately and was baptized that very Sunday. Because
of this decision, his parents disowned him and he was left without a home. Eventually, he took
passage on a ship, ending up in Nauvoo in time to secure a handcart and make the long journey
with the Saints coming to the Salt Lake Valley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There are other great individuals whose lives and example have served as a guiding light to
millions. Today, I would like to speak about three such individuals - people who are already
familiar to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Their stars shine brightly in the annals of history. Clear, bright, and ever true, their light is
radiant and never-failing. Their examples of excellence, like the stars that guided the Polynesian
pilots, can guide us in our own journey through life. </span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">President Gordon B. Hinckley</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Gordon B. Hinckley is a man whom I have revered and loved for a very long time. I
was a teenager when he returned from serving a mission to England. I remember the day he
spoke about his mission experiences in sacrament meeting and talked of his love and admiration
of the British people. Many of my friends were present and both they and I felt inspired to serve
missions as a result of this talk. After the meeting, I spoke with Elder Hinckley and he said to
me: &#8220;One of the most important things you can do is to go on a mission. The privilege of serving
the Lord full-time is a gift beyond measure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The words he spoke were such an influence on me that it strengthened my resolve to serve a
mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When my father passed away in 1963, President Hinckley came to our home. I&#8217;ll never forget his
kindness. He gave my mother a blessing and, among other things, promised that she had much to
look forward to and that life would be sweet to her. These words gave comfort and
encouragement to my mother and were an inspiration to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley is a visionary man. In his patriarchal blessing, it was promised that &#8220;the
nations of the earth shall hear thy voice and be brought to a knowledge of the truth by the
wonderful testimony which thou shalt bear&#8221; (Sheri L. Dew, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Go Forward With Faith</span>, Deseret
Book, 1996, p.60). When President Hinckley finished his mission, he felt that this portion of his
blessing had been fulfilled as he had testified of the truth in more than one nation. Since that
time he has visited nearly every nation on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Of course those early experiences were only the first of thousands he has had since that time to
bear his testimony throughout the world to millions of people. That experience has taught
President Hinckley never to underestimate the promises and power of the Lord. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I can tell you from personal experience that he is a man of faith who believes that when the Lord
speaks, the Lord provides. Like Nephi of old, he knows that no matter how impossible the task
may seem, our Heavenly Father will provide a way for it to be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One of the great challenges the Church faced not long ago was that its membership was
expanding throughout the world and yet there were so few temples. Often Church members went
to great lengths and immense sacrifice to travel to a temple to receive the holy ordinances that
are available there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley struggled with this. How could the eternal blessings of the temple be made
available to the many faithful members who did not live near a temple? As he wrestled with this
problem, an idea came to him. Why couldn&#8217;t we build smaller temples? We could build them on
smaller plots of ground, it would take fewer people to serve as temple workers, we could open
them only as demand required. Why couldn&#8217;t the blessings of the temple be extended to millions
of faithful members of the Church that otherwise would be without the opportunity?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">During the April 1998 General Conference, President Hinckley announced &#8220;a program to
construct some 30 smaller temples immediately&#8221;
(http://lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,49-1-26-35,00.html). At that time, there were 51
temples in operation and those had taken roughly 150 years to build. In the seven years since that
announcement, 68 new temples have been dedicated bringing the total to 119
(http://lds.org/temples/chronological/0,11206,1900-1,00.html). In addition, 11 more have been
announced and are in the process of being constructed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">You will never find a man as kind and considerate as President Gordon B. Hinckley. When it
comes to doctrine, he never deviates. And he is one of the hardest working General Authorities I
have known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In a recent interview with Larry King, President Hinckley was asked how he was doing since his
beloved wife Marjorie passed away. He said that he felt pretty lonely at times. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Mr. King asked, &#8220;How do you get over that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley&#8217;s response was as touching as it was profound: &#8220;You never get over it &#8230; the
best thing you can do is just keep busy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Keep working hard, so you're not dwelling on
it all the time. Work is the best antidote for sorrow&#8221; (http://www.cesnur.org/2004/lds.htm).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have watched President Hinckley throw his every effort into accomplishing the work the Lord
has set for him. I testify to you that he is a prophet of God and that he leads the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am honored to call President Gordon B. Hinckley my prophet and my friend.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Prophet Joseph Smith</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This year, we celebrate the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of The Prophet, Joseph Smith. He is the
second guiding light I would like to recommend to you. Sometimes, the more familiar we are
with someone, the less we appreciate them. But when it comes to The Prophet Joseph, the more I
learn of him, the more I love and revere him. We believe that in the history of the world, he has
done more for the salvation of mankind than any other person save Jesus only (Doctrine and
Covenants 135:3).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He was a man for whom the heavens parted. He witnessed the reality of a loving Heavenly
Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. He saw and spoke with angels, received priesthood keys from
heavenly messengers, and had discourse with many of the great souls who had lived on earth. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When the Prophet spoke, he could hold the interest of people for hours at a time. One who heard
him speak said, &#8220;The testimony of Joseph struck through the heart, and, like the thunder of the
cataract, declared at once the dignity and matchless supremacy of the creator&#8221; (Lyman O.
Littlefield, quoted in Mark L. McConkie, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Remembering Joseph</span>, Deseret Book, 2003, p. 98).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Those who met The Prophet, even those who did not believe what he taught, often described him
as &#8220;extraordinary,&#8221; &#8220;noble,&#8221; and &#8220;God-like.&#8221; 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Missourian General Moses Wilson was a bitter enemy of the Church. At one point Joseph was
delivered into General Wilson&#8217;s hands as a prisoner. General Wilson later said of him, &#8220;He was a
very remarkable man. I carried him into my house, a prisoner in chains, and in less than two
hours my wife loved him better than she did me&#8221; (President George A. Smith, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Journal of
Discourses</span>, V.17, p 92).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">On another occasion, a large group of men approached stating they had come to &#8220;kill Joe Smith
and all the Mormons.&#8221; Joseph smiled, and shook their hands. He sat down with them and
explained to them many of the difficulties the Saints had suffered and their claim against the
injustices that had been heaped upon them. After talking to them for some time he turned and
said, &#8220;I believe I will go home now - Emma will be expecting me.&#8221; 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">At this, two of the officers who had come to kill him suggested that he should not go home alone
and insisted that they would provide an escort to ensure his safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As they left, Joseph&#8217;s mother heard one say, &#8220;Did you not feel strangely when Smith took you by
the hand?&#8221; <span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another said, &#8220;I could not move. I would not harm a hair of that man&#8217;s head for the whole
world&#8221; (Lucy Mack Smith, <span style="text-decoration: underline">History of Joseph Smith by His Mother</span>, pp. 255-256).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph Smith was the man who, before he had reached 25, had translated the Book of Mormon.
He did this in a period of less than three months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our translators at the Church Office building can translate the Book of Mormon at the rate of
roughly a page a day. Joseph Smith translated the original at a rate of 10 manuscript pages per
day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Could you imagine being given that task as an assignment in one of your classes? Your goal
would be to write a book of more than 500 single-spaced pages that recounts the history of a
nation over a period of a thousand years? The book you write must be consistent with historical
evidence of the period. It must stand under the strictest scrutiny and have no contradictions in
date, personalities, or events. It must contain revelations from God to man and have the power of
testimony such that millions upon millions who read it can testify of its truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When you take into consideration that Joseph had logged less time in school than our average
third grader, it makes what he did seem more impossible by human standards. Consider Joseph
Smith carefully and you are left with only one conclusion: Joseph Smith saw what he said he
saw. He heard what he said he heard. And he translated The Book of Mormon through the power
of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph Smith was a man who had been granted the privilege of transcending space and time. He
not only had seen the past, but he knew the future. I have read one account where Joseph was
waiting in Dimick Huntington&#8217;s boot shop and, to pass the time, he began speaking about events
in earth&#8217;s history, explaining many events Brother Huntington was not familiar with. But, &#8220;when
he came to present times, he didn&#8217;t stop, but went on and related the principle events that will
transpire in the history of the world down to the time when the angel will declare that time shall
be no longer&#8221;(Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">They Knew the Prophet</span> (Salt Lake
City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1974), p. 66).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But even though the Prophet Joseph was a man who had conversed not only with angels, he was
a man of a compassionate and kind heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When Joseph was serving as mayor of Nauvoo, a man was brought to him and accused of selling
liquor on Sunday. The man explained that he had a dear child who was being held as a slave in a
Southern state and he was trying to get enough money to buy the child&#8217;s freedom. He pled with
the prophet not to punish him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Anthony,&#8221; Joseph said to the man, &#8220;but the law must be observed, and we will have
to impose a fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The next day, the Prophet gave the man one of his fine horses telling him to sell it and use the
money to purchase the freedom of the child (Mark L. McConkie, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Remembering Joseph</span>, Deseret
Book, 2003, p. 55).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Like millions of others, my life is richer, sweeter, and transformed because of the life and words
of The Prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith. </span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Jesus, the Christ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The third guiding light I wish to speak with you about is that of our Lord and Savior, Jesus
Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Oh, that I had the voice of an angel, that I could convey the depth of the feelings of my heart for
this man among men, who is my Savior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He lived that we may live forever. He lived that we may experience a fullness of joy. He lived
that our sojourn - not only through these few years we pass in mortality, but through the infinite
reaches of limitless eternity - may be glorious and our hearts and minds filled with a fullness of
love, joy, and peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He rebuked death and raised those whose spirits had departed this life. He commanded the sick,
the lame, and the afflicted to be healed and they were healed. He commanded the earth and the
skies and they obeyed. He stood in majesty before those who would destroy him and bore
solemn testimony of the truth. He took a few morsels of food and fed thousands. He rebuked
Satan and the evil one departed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Though Jesus could command legions of angels - though the ocean, earth, and sky, obeyed his
word - the man from Galilee was meek and humble and mild. Often he knelt in prayer and
supplication as He communed with His Father in Heaven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Because of the sublime words of Jesus Christ, we understand what it means to love our neighbor,
become holy, and we understand the true power of faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Once, when traveling through Samaria, the Savior asked a woman to draw water and give Him to
drink. Because of the hatred between the Jews and the Samaritans, the woman marveled at the
request. Jesus then spoke to her and said, <i>&#8220;Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I
shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life&#8221;</i> (John 4:13,14).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As with the woman of Samaria, this living water is available to us if we will only partake of it. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Savior calls to us today as he has done in ages past: &#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we follow the Savior in spirit and in truth, we leave behind us the mundane enticements of
this tired earth and take upon us the life of adventure in the Spirit. As we covenant to remember
the Lord and drink of living water, we step into the threshold of a new day; we enter a world of
faith, wonder, and light.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Pursuit of Perfection</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and President Gordon B. Hinckley
are three great examples worthy of emulation. Although each of them lived in different times and
faced different challenges, each is a beacon of excellence that can provide light for our own
journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, there are some who, instead of being inspired by the examples of great men and women,
instead become discouraged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If you have ever felt inadequate, if you have ever felt that you don&#8217;t have the inherent capacity of
others, if you have ever felt that no matter how hard you try, you are never good enough, I have a
word of advice for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Your life is not a race. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">You are not competing against anyone else for entrance into the presence of our Heavenly
Father. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The plan of salvation is not a reality show where you have to beat out other contestants to win. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have more good news. As long as you seek to grow closer to your Heavenly Father and your
hearts and spirits are contrite - as long as you repent and strive in faith to overcome weaknesses -
you will be rewarded by our Heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our purpose in this life is to fill our minds with all truth and our hearts with the Spirit of the
Lord that we may become more holy and, more like those great souls who preceded us. As we
learn and apply the principles of the Gospel in our lives, the atonement of the Savior will cleanse
us of iniquity enabling us to live in peace and righteousness in this world and in glory throughout
the worlds to come. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our task is not in one day to become perfect, but to grow a little more perfect every day. Even if
it&#8217;s only a small step, the important thing is that we keep walking forward, each day getting a
little closer to our glorious destination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Do you think perfection is too high of a standard? 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know people who are perfect in paying their tithing. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know many who are perfect in attending Sacrament Meeting, going to the temple often, reading
the scriptures daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">They didn&#8217;t start out being perfect perhaps, but they made a commitment and they followed
through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I encourage you to do the same. We all know the things we need to work on. We don&#8217;t need
well-intentioned people to reveal our shortcomings - although at times it appears there is never a
scarcity of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">On every side we have before us the examples of many great souls. Their lives can inspire us.
Their actions can encourage us. Their faithfulness can give us hope and confidence that we can
do the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Never be satisfied with less than your best. And don&#8217;t allow yourself to get discouraged when
your actions don&#8217;t measure up to your thoughts and feelings. Work every day to become a little
more perfect, a little more righteous, and a little more holy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Remember your destiny as sons and daughters of the Most High God is to overcome challenges
and stand triumphant and victorious at the final day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That is your destiny. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is your birthright as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have learned to do something that may be of use to you. Each evening, I take inventory of my
day. I review the events of the day and give thanks for the things that went well and consider the
things I could have done better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Instead of getting discouraged when I make mistakes, I try to learn from them. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I write down the things I need to accomplish the next day and make a plan as to how I can
accomplish them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Finally, I go before the Lord with my report. I ask for His forgiveness for my shortcomings and
plead for strength and wisdom to improve. I invite the Spirit of the Lord into our home and our
family. And I ask for the Lord&#8217;s guiding hand to help me become more like Him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Don&#8217;t fret when your thoughts or actions fail to measure up to your potential, rejoice that
through the atonement of our Savior, you can repent. Regardless of our shortcomings, through
the refining influence of the Holy Ghost, we can improve our lives daily. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Be of good cheer. This journey we are taking is not one of drudgery or discouragement, but one
of delight and destiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Learn from your mistakes. Seek forgiveness of those you have wronged. Forgive those who have
wronged you. Have faith that your loving Heavenly Father knows you. He will bless you as you
pursue righteous desires. And you will come to know that &#8220;all things work together for good to
them who walk uprightly&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 90:24).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Like the ancient Polynesian pilots who followed the stars towards their destination, you can
study the lives of righteous souls of every generation and follow their examples. As you do so,
you will find your way through the vast and dark oceans of the trials of this life and come at last
to the land promised by the Father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I bear witness that we lived before this life in the company of great and noble souls. After we
depart this existence, we will once again have the opportunity to renew our acquaintances with
them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We are children of the infinite Heavenly Father. He exists. He hears us as we pray. He loves us
with a love beyond our comprehension. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He sent his Son, Jesus Christ to this earth to bring about the eternal work of the atonement.
Because of Him, we will live forever. Because of Him, our faults and weaknesses can be
cleansed and we can become perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph Smith was called of God to restore the Gospel to earth. With help from beyond the veil,
Joseph Smith brought about the work of restoring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. He received the keys of the priesthood and revealed ordinances essential to salvation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Today, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led by a man of God, a prophet, a
choice servant of our Heavenly Father. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Gordon B. Hinckley presides over and leads the Lord&#8217;s Church in accordance with the
will of heaven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Church is true. God lives. As we embrace the principles of The Gospel, we will find peace
in this life and immeasurable joy in the hereafter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The great Book of Mormon prophet, Ether, wrote, 
		<i>&#8220;In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a
more excellent way&#8221;</i> (Ether 12:11).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My earnest desire is that we may all rejoice in that gift and that we may find that excellent way is
my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</span></p>

</p>
<p>The principle of agency is central to our Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan. We know from the scriptures
the War in Heaven resulted from differences in how agency would be applied. Our agency gives
us the right to choose. Those of us who followed Jehovah stood firm for the right to make our
own choices. As a result, when Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden, in order to
prove them to see if they would do whatsoever the Lord their God would command them they
were given choices. So now, here we are in mortality for that same purpose. Life is full of
choices. Some we make ourselves and sometimes circumstances are thrust upon us. For example,
I didn&#8217;t choose to get to this stage of life and have my eyes such that I would need to wear
glasses in order to see very clearly beyond the first row of this auditorium; but I did get to
choose what kind of glasses I would wear once I got to this point. We start making choices at an
early age and make a lot of choices throughout our lives. Some choices are easy while others are
hard. Some are daily choices that are generally simple or routine. Some involve long-term
commitments. Some are life-changing experiences that require significant thought and prayer.</p>
<p>Education, career choices, missions, marriage, and family are all big decisions. Today, I would
like to have you think some about life&#8217;s most important choices. I will start by commenting a
little on these big decisions just mentioned.   </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Making Choices</span></p>
<p>First, education and career choices. You students are all at this stage of life right now. Prophets
have encouraged us to get as much education as possible. Why is education so important? The
concepts of education, teaching, learning, knowledge, and intelligence are mentioned repeatedly
throughout the scriptures. When you think we are going to have to know enough to create worlds
some day, we have so much to learn. The Prophet Joseph instructed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Whatever degree of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in
the resurrection.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his
diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the
world to come </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 130: 18-19).  </p>
<p>I believe one of the purposes of a college education is to stimulate an interest in learning and to
help us learn how to learn. Real learning is both intellectual and spiritual. The Lord said, 
		<i>&#8220;Seek
learning, even by study and also by faith&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118). I think that means
you cannot successfully get through your finals with faith alone; you also have to prepare by
studying.</p>
<p>While it is important for you to study hard and do well in your classes, many of the facts and
details you gain while here will either be forgotten or outdated over time. Although some things
change, the process of learning remains fairly constant. The spark of intellectual interest will
ignite the light in the lamp learning and open our minds to the many things there are to learn.
Knowing how to think and to learn allows us to keep updated or to expand our knowledge by
learning new things or to think about things in new ways. Thus, the desire to learn will continue
to burn within us throughout our lifetime. And the more we learn the more we will marvel at the
knowledge and majesty of God and His creations. If we value learning and make it an integral
part of our being, we will keep growing and in the process, we will prepare to be of greater
service to Him in His kingdom.</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell has stated:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For the disciple of Jesus Christ, academic scholarship is&#8230;actually another
dimension of consecration. Hence one who seeks to be a disciple-scholar will take
both scholarship and discipleship seriously...For the disciple-scholar, the first
and second great commandments frame and prioritize life. How else could one
worship God with all of one&#8217;s heart, might, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">mind,</span> and strength?</i> (Luke 10:27,
emphasis added)</p>
<p>Touching on career choices, Elder Maxwell stated, <i>&#8220;Whether one is a neurosurgeon, forest
ranger, mechanic, farmer, or teacher is a matter of preference not principle.&#8221; 
		</i>So how do you
choose when there are so many options? I am occasionally asked how I ended up in my current
assignment and what I did to prepare for it. Honestly, it has been a rather circuitous route, as you
could tell from my background given in the introduction. There is still more to the story. I knew
what my aptitudes were and had confidence Heavenly Father would guide my footsteps as I
sought His guidance in making choices. When I first started in college, I majored in chemistry
and thought I wanted to go into dentistry and become an orthodontist. After a while, I reached
the conclusion that for me personally I would be &#8220;down in the mouth&#8221; too much in that
profession, so I decided perhaps I would become a chemistry teacher. Then I went on a mission.</p>
<p>After I came home my interests were different, so I changed my major to accounting and ended
up going into the business world. Several years into my career, I started working for the Church.</p>
<p>One day after a meeting, President Hinckley invited me into his office and asked if I would take
this assignment within the Church Educational System. Like you would be, I was anxious to do
whatever the prophet wanted me to do, so here I am.</p>
<p>Although educational interests and career choices are a matter of personal preference, our
Heavenly Father is interested in the details of our lives. He knows us and He understands what
our talents are. He also knows where we need to be stretched in order to accomplish His
purposes. He will help us as we make these important choices if we earnestly seek His guidance.</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell continued:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>While&#8230;career choices are clearly important, these do not mark your real career
path&#8230;</i>[you]<i> have been invited to take the path that leads home&#8230;but the capacity
to work and work wisely will never become obsolete. And neither will the ability
to learn.</i></p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s talk about missions. 4,748 of you have already served a mission. Others still have that
opportunity waiting in your future. Who should serve a mission? Prophets have said that every
young man should be worthy and serve a mission. It is a priesthood responsibility. Young
women may serve, but they are not under the same obligation as the young men of the
priesthood. More recently, prophets have indicated the importance of raising the bar of spiritual
preparation. That does not mean there should be fewer missionaries. Simply put, there is a need
for more and better prepared missionaries and proper preparation takes time.</p>
<p>If a person grows up with the idea in mind of just going on a mission, then he or she may not
start thinking much about what is required for a mission until just a few months before meeting
with the bishop and stake president for the interviews concomitant with the missionary
recommendation. There is a big difference between going on a mission and being a missionary.
A person who is concerned about becoming a missionary (or in other words, being a disciple of
Christ) will always live the kind of life that will prepare him for life-long service, not just
missionary service. Then when the call comes &#8211; a mission call or any other calling in the
kingdom &#8211; whenever, wherever, or whatever the call may be, he will be ready.</p>
<p>Even if you are ready, it may not preclude you from feelings of anxiety, fear or inadequacy when
the time arrives, however. I had prepared from a very young age to be a missionary. But on the
day I was supposed to meet with my bishop to start the recommendation process, I started
thinking about how significant the responsibility was. I had to make sure this was really what
Heavenly Father wanted me to do and to receive His assurance that I could handle such a sacred
calling. I found a secluded spot where I could be alone to ponder and pray and received a very
clear message that serving a mission was the most important thing I could be doing with my life
at that time.</p>
<p>Hopefully, each of you has been preparing for a long time. A pattern for the necessity for proper
preparation is demonstrated by the law of the harvest. For example, if I want a fresh peach pie in
September I can&#8217;t plant a tree in July and expect it to produce fruit immediately. The law of the
harvest requires planting, watering, fertilizing, nurturing, pruning, and preparing. It takes
significant planning and preparation over an extended period of time to produce the desired
outcome. In the case of the peaches, it takes a number of years. The same is true in preparing to
be a missionary or to enter the temple worthily. President Faust stated, <i>&#8220;Making a wrong choice
early may limit making the right choice later.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>If for some reason you have not been focused properly on preparing to serve, or have not been a
member of the Church your whole life to have the advantages of gospel living, or have made
choices that you think will preclude you from serving, now is the time to decide what you will
do. There is no room for ambivalence. You cannot consciously put off preparing with the
anticipation of getting things in order later. You must start today. If you prepare well now and
serve faithfully, you will have no regrets later on. But you must thrust in your cycle with all your
might (Doctrine and Covenants 4). This is the Lord&#8217;s work and He will not let you fail.
Sometimes circumstances may preclude some from being able to serve a mission.  
		</p>
<p>Does serving a mission or not differentiate a person as either a saint or a sinner? Not really. I
know many returned missionaries who are not saints and many who never served a mission who
are. However, those who do serve are generally better people than they would have been
otherwise. The difference is the kind of attitude one has about such service. Missionary service,
faithfully performed, helps lay a spiritual foundation to build upon the rest of our lives. Young
men, there is no substitute for being prepared and serving faithfully. A mission will help you
learn service, sacrifice, caring for others more than self, and hard work. Young women, if you
are attracted to someone with those qualities and who will listen and respond to the spirit (not as
well as you do, but at least he is learning), then encourage all the young men you know to serve a
mission. And when the time comes, find a worthy young man to marry who is totally committed
to serving the Lord.</p>
<p>Now, we come to marriage and families. The marriage decision is a critical choice. Heavenly
Father&#8217;s plan anticipates each of us gaining eternal life. Eternal life means having an eternal
companion and eternal increase. The scriptures tell us, <i>&#8220;Neither is man without the woman,
neither the woman without the man, in the Lord&#8221; </i>(1 Corninthians 11:11). In order to attain the
highest degree of the Celestial Kingdom, we must have a worthy eternal companion. How do
you know when the choice is right? Some worry so much about making a mistake on such an
important decision that they want to date every eligible person of the opposite sex trying to find
the &#8220;right&#8221; one. Some procrastinate facing the decision even if the Spirit is beating them over the
head.</p>
<p>One young woman was concerned because she was dating three different returned missionaries,
all of whom proposed marriage. All three indicated they had prayed about it and each knew she
was the right one for them. She went to see a priesthood leader to find out how it could be
possible that three different young men could all get the same answer about her. The priesthood
leader reported that she was a lovely young woman. When she walked into his office, he sensed
it was obvious the inspiration these young men were receiving was hormonal revelation, not
necessarily spiritual revelation. He then counseled this young lady appropriately, indicating that
personal revelation is personal. No one is entitled to receive revelation for someone else unless
there is a stewardship relationship. Between a man and a woman, that doesn&#8217;t happen until after
marriage covenants are made. She needed to find out for herself who was right for her.</p>
<p>Sister Ardeth Kapp related the story of an experience while she was serving with her husband as
he presided over a mission in Canada. Following a Zone Conference, a few of the sister
missionaries gathered around to visit with her while the president was conducting interviews.
These missionaries, I&#8217;m sure thinking about this important decision they would eventually make
in finding a worthy husband, commented, &#8220;Sister Kapp, your husband is so wonderful. Where
did you find a man like that?&#8221; Her response was classic. She said, &#8220;Well, he wasn&#8217;t like that
when I found him.&#8221; The implication is that you don&#8217;t find a perfect spouse. You pray about it,
you make a choice, you marry someone who has the potential of becoming perfect and then work
together throughout life to make it happen. </p>
<p>If you follow all the right steps, does that mean you won&#8217;t have problems in your marriage? No.
Life is full of challenges and problems. Getting married doesn&#8217;t end problems; it provides you
with a companion to help you work through life&#8217;s problems together. We are guaranteed
happiness, however, if we choose someone who inspires us to be better whenever we are either
in their presence or away from them, someone who we want to spend eternity with, and together
both are striving to live the gospel. I am grateful for a wife who is willing to overlook my faults
and weaknesses; one who inspires and encourages me to be better. I can tell you from personal
experience that with that kind of relationship, marriage keeps getting better all the time.</p>
<p>President Kimball said there is a pattern for success and happiness in life. It includes attending
seminary, serving a mission, getting married and starting a family, finishing school, having a
career, and serving in the Church. I understand that a significant number of students here at
BYU-Idaho understand the plan.</p>
<p>Regarding having families and the nature of intimate relationships within marriage, the Brethren
have stated:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It is the privilege of married couples who are able to bear children to provide
mortal bodies for the spirit children of God, whom they are then responsible to
nurture and rear. The decision as to how many children to have and when to have
them is extremely intimate and private and should be left between the couple and
the Lord. Church members should not judge one another in this matter.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Married couples also should understand that sexual relations within marriage are
divinely approved not only for the purpose of procreation, but also as a means of
expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between
husband and wife.</i></p>
<p>I hope all of you had the opportunity to listen to Elder Nelson&#8217;s address to young adults he gave
just over a week ago on Faith and Families. It was a powerful message related to these issues.</p>
<p>I encourage you to get a copy of his talk to study and to live by those principles in your own
marriages.</p>
<p>There are a few who do not have the choice of whether they marry in this life. Sister Sheri Dew
has stated that if worthiness, prayer, and temple attendance were all that were required to find an
eternal companion, she would have been married a long time ago. For reasons known to the
Lord, the opportunity for marriage seems to elude some while in mortality. If you find yourself
in this category, just know that if you always remain faithful and worthy of all of the blessings
God has to offer, He will not deny you the gift of a righteous eternal companion.</p>
<p>Throughout life, you will encounter many choices which will require important decisions.
Personal perspective or the filter we use in evaluating and making major choices in our lives can
have long-lasting consequences and make a significant difference in the outcome and the
associated blessings. The decisions you make will determine the direction you go. Understanding
who you are and the degree to which you rely on the Lord in making your decisions will
influence not only the direction, but also your final destination. Elder Maxwell illustrated very
clearly the importance of our choices when he stated, <i>&#8220;If you don't choose the Kingdom of God
first, in the end, it won't make any difference what you choose.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Clearly, the most important choice we make then is to choose to follow God 
		<i>&#8220;at all times and in
all things and in all places&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 18:9).</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Choose to Follow Christ</span></p>
<p>When the Savior called his disciples from the shores of the Sea of Galilee, they had a choice to
make. He said simply, &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; Each of us must decide will we choose to follow Him? 
		</p>
<p>President Kimball gave some insights into the urgency of this invitation. His perspective was,
&#8220;Leave the fishing nets and come, not after the fishing season, not after the next catch, but now!&#8221;</p>
<p>If we choose to follow Christ, we choose to be changed. It changes the way we look, the way we
think, the way we act, and the way we talk. It changes the way we dress, the way we treat others,
the way we honor our covenants, and the way we fulfill our callings. It changes the way we see
ourselves, the way we see others, and the way we see the world. It changes the way we make
choices in our lives.</p>
<p>All of us here chose to follow Christ in our premortal existence. As a result, we were changed
from our first estate to this mortal second estate. Unfortunately, some who followed Christ then
got to mortality and chose to change sides! What irony. After being valiant in one sphere of our
existence, why would anyone throw it all away in this sphere? Obviously, the person who makes
those choices doesn&#8217;t understand who they really are or there is some aspect of the doctrine of
Christ they do not fully understand. After rejecting the father of lies once in their lives, they start
to listen to and perhaps believe in what he has to offer. One of our roles as members of the
Church is to live our lives so we become living examples of having faith in Christ. We need to
teach by precept and example the blessings that come from continuing to follow Him. We know
that if we choose to follow Christ faithfully during mortality, we will have glory added upon our
heads for ever and ever (Abraham 3:26).</p>
<p>When we choose to follow Christ, we must learn to become like him. If we want to become like
Christ, we have to develop Christ-like attributes. Many of these Christ-like attributes are
described in Moroni 7. They include things such as being meek, lowly of heart, kind, humble,
not puffed up, not easily provoked, thinking no evil thoughts, rejoicing in the truth &#8211; not in
iniquity, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things, being full of faith, hope, and
charity.</p>
<p>As we become more Christ-like, we are worthy to take His name upon us, which we covenant to
do at baptism and then thereafter whenever we partake of the sacrament. What does it mean to
take upon us the name of the Savior? Selecting a name for a child according to Hebrew custom
was an important and sacred occasion. Many names included reference to Elohim or Jehovah as
either a prefix or a suffix to the individual&#8217;s name, for example, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Jonathan
or Hannah, Rachel, and Sariah. The anticipation was that the person would reflect upon the
nature of God and acquire His characteristics and emulate His attributes in their daily living. As
we take upon us the name of Christ, we should reflect upon His nature, acquire His
characteristics, and emulate His attributes in our lives. When you think about it in that context, it
gives a renewed meaning to the commandment, <i>&#8220;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain&#8221; </i>(Exodus 20:7)<i>.</i></p>
<p>The Savior always provides the perfect pattern. He said, <i>&#8220;I have given you an example, that ye
should do as I have done to you&#8221;</i> (John 13:15). As you think about the power of the atonement,
if the Lord were to take upon himself each of our names, He would have a perfect understanding
of our nature, character, and attributes; as well as all of our pain, sorrow, and sins. As we stand
before Him in judgment, we will not be able to hide anything from Him, because He will
understand everything about us perfectly.</p>
<p>Through the redeeming power of the atonement, He can literally change us. As Alma noted, we
can receive His image in our countenances (Alma 5:14). Each one of us needs to have this
redeeming experience. Whether the change occurs early in our lives or later on, it must happen
for every one of us.</p>
<p>However, I would caution, as did Alma, <i>&#8220;do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until
the end&#8221;</i> (Alma 34:33). President Packer stated:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Some worry endlessly over missions that were missed, or marriages that did not
turn out, or babies that did not arrive, or children that seem lost, or dreams
unfulfilled, or because age limits what they can do. I do not think it pleases the
Lord when we worry because we think we never do enough or that what we do is
never good enough. Some needlessly carry a heavy burden of guilt which could be
removed.</i></p>
<p>Through the atonement He allows us to see ourselves in a new light and to turn our hearts and
will to God. And as Elder Maxwell has stated, <i>&#8220;The submission of one&#8217;s will is really the only
uniquely personal thing we have to place on God&#8217;s alter.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Once our feet are planted on the straight and narrow path, we <i>&#8220;must press forward with a
steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men&#8221;</i>
(2 Nephi 31:20). If we then hold firmly to the<i> &#8220;rod of iron&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 8:19) and 
		<i>&#8220;press forward,
feasting on the words of Christ, and endure to the end, behold thus saith the Father, 
		</i>[we] <i>shall
have eternal life&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 31:20).</p>
<p>If we are firmly anchored in Christ, we will always be on safe ground. President Howard W.
Hunter noted, <i>&#8220;If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel,
nothing can ever go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the
Savior and his teaching, no other success can ever be permanently right.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Our constant focus should always be to strive to become more and more like Him in all aspects
of our lives. The familiar Primary song summarizes how we should approach our discipleship to
Him.</p>

<p>The promises of the Lord are clear. The doorway to God's blessings turns on small hinges.  The
choices we make now, today, will determine the blessings we eventually will receive tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is left up to us what we will choose to do. God does not judge us on our abilities, but on our
choices. If we desire to inherit the blessings of God, we must strive to become more Christ-like
and follow Him. I will conclude with the words of a hymn that convey this spirit.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Thomas E. Ricks Building Dedication 
		</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">February 18, 2005</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Elder David A. Bednar</span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a privilege and an honor for Sister Bednar and me to be here with you
on this special occasion. I might note that it is easy to see the hand of the Lord in the selection of
Elder Kerr as the Commissioner of Church Education. He will do much to move the work of
education forward in the Church.</p>
<p>I have been intimately involved in the planning for and constructing of this building for a
number of years, and I fully expected to attend this dedicatory session. But never did I ever think
I would be invited to offer the dedicatory prayer and to attend and participate in this service in
the role in which I am participating today. </p>
<p>I suppose it would be customary and even expected that today we would pay tribute to and honor
the memory and accomplishments and legacy of Thomas E. Ricks. Indeed he was a remarkable
man who did much to strengthen the Church and to establish this community. However, today I
would like to pay tribute to Thomas E. Ricks in a slightly different way. </p>
<p>I invite you to pay close attention for a few moments as we discuss the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i> and what
that means. Given my almost eight years of service on this campus, I want to see if I cannot give
voice to and articulate some things about the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> has long been the hallmark and defining phrase that describes this remarkable
institution. The <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> suggests the spirituality, the desire for obedience, the personal
caring and warmth, the humility and modesty, the friendliness and genuine concern for others,
the bright smiles and cheerful hellos, and so many other elements that make this university an
unusually inviting and supporting and nurturing institution.</p>
<p>In recent years some of the new students at BYU-Idaho, students who have not acquainted
themselves with the history of Ricks College, have wondered why we talk so much about the
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i> when the school is now named Brigham Young University-Idaho. The answer to
that question is very simple. The <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> has been and always will be a defining
characteristic of this institution&#8212;regardless of the name of the institution.</p>
<p>The phrase the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> speaks to the commitment, to the sacrifice, and to the integrity of
so many who have helped make this institution what it is today&#8212;and what it will ultimately and
inevitably become in the future. If the day should ever come that the phrase the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i>
and its connotations were lost from the vocabulary of Brigham Young University-Idaho, then
something fundamental and foundational would be absent from this institution.</p>
<p>You will find many definitions for the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i>, but today I would like to reiterate the
definitions I came to understand during my service here in Rexburg. The <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> is the
Holy Ghost and its attendant spiritual gifts.</p>
<p>Following a presentation several years ago in which I referred to the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i> as the Holy
Ghost, a faculty colleague suggested to me that he was troubled by my definition&#8212;that it was
too simple and incomplete. I, in turn, suggested to him that defining the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> as the
Holy Ghost was the most comprehensive and the most complete definition possible.</p>
<p>Please now consider the attributes that we so often consider to be central to the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i> as
we review the following teachings of Elder Parley P. Pratt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>An intelligent being, in the image of God, possesses every organ, attribute, sense,
sympathy, affection that is possessed by God Himself.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But these are possessed by man, in his rudimental state, in a subordinate sense of
the word. Or, in other words, these attributes are in embryo; and are to be
gradually developed. They resemble a bud, a germ, which gradually develops into
bloom, and then, by progress, produces the mature fruit, after its own kind.</i></p>
<p>Let me step out of the quote for a second. Consider who we are and where we are on this
campus. Consider the imagery of the bud, the germ, and the developmental process. And in the
totality of this quote from Elder Pratt, consider that as it focuses on who we are and what we
might become through what is available on this campus. I now continue the quote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The gift of the Holy Ghost adapts itself to all these organs or attributes. It
quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies
all the natural passion and affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to
their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine-toned
sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our nature. It inspires
virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty
of the person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social
feeling. It invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It
strengthens, and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the
bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole
being. </i></p>
<p>Now, that focuses on the role of the Holy Ghost in the developmental process that was described
in the earlier paragraph. I continue with the quote (now, this is where you really have to listen): 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In the presence of such persons, one feels to enjoy the light of their countenances,
as the genial rays of the sunbeam. Their very atmosphere diffuses a thrill, a warm
glow of pure gladness and sympathy, to the heart and nerves of others who have
kindred feelings, or sympathy of spirit. No matter if the parties are strangers,
entirely unknown to each other in person or character; no matter if they have
never spoken to each other, each will be apt to remark in his own mind, and
perhaps exclaim, when referring to the interview&#8211; &#8220;Oh, what an atmosphere
encircles that stranger! How my heart thrilled with pure and holy feelings in his
presence! What confidence and sympathy he inspired! His countenance and spirit
gave me more assurance than a thousand written recommendations, or
introductory letters.&#8221; Such is the gift of the Holy Ghost, and such are its
operations, when received through the lawful channel&#8212;the divine, eternal
priesthood.</i></p>
<p>To those who spend considerable time on this campus, I invite you to consider the interactions of
students&#8212;as they greet each other on this campus and they smile and say hello, the interaction of
faculty and students and others&#8212;and to consider these statements by Elder Pratt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>No matter if the parties are strangers, entirely unknown to each other in person
or character; no matter if they have never spoken to each other, each will be apt
to remark in his own mind and perhaps exclaim, when referring to the
interview&#8212;&#8220;Oh, what an atmosphere encircles that stranger&#8221;</i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Key to the
Science of Theology</span>, pp. 100-102).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is the most beautiful description I have ever read or heard of what we
on this campus frequently refer to as the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i>. And the ongoing tribute we pay to
Thomas E. Ricks&#8212;a tribute far more meaningful and significant than naming a university or a
building or a garden in his honor&#8212;is that the workings of the Holy Ghost in this sacred and set
apart place are affectionately and warmly referred to as the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i>.</p>
<p>In 1987 Elder Marvin J. Ashton, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, spoke in general
conference about spiritual gifts. Interestingly, he detailed and described a number of
less-conspicuous spiritual gifts&#8212;attributes that many of us might not have ever considered
spiritual gifts. For example, Elder Ashton highlighted:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of asking;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of listening;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of hearing and using a still, small voice (when we communicate);</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of being able to weep (I am married to the person on the planet
who has more of that gift than any other person who has ever
lived);</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of avoiding contention;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of being agreeable; 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of seeking that which is righteous;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of looking to God for guidance;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of being a disciple;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of caring for others;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of being able to ponder;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of bearing mighty testimony;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of receiving the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>And he continued with a number of other less-conspicuous spiritual gifts.</p>
<p>As I think of these gifts, I find a clear linkage between many of them and the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i>. Let
me emphasize once again that the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i> is the Holy Ghost and its attendant spiritual
gifts. In fact, I might add to Elder Ashton&#8217;s list some additional gifts that are especially
characteristic of this campus in Rexburg, Idaho:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of smiling;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of learning or teaching without becoming intellectually arrogant;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of cheerfulness;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of avoiding the supposed cleverness and cuteness of secular
cynicism;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#8226;the gift of academic integrity.</p>
<p>And the ongoing tribute we pay to Thomas E. Ricks&#8212;a tribute far more meaningful and
significant than naming the university or a building or a garden in his honor&#8212;is that the
workings of the Holy Ghost in this sacred and set apart place are affectionately and warmly
referred to as the <i>Spirit of Ricks</i>.</p>
<p>I conclude my remarks this afternoon by repeating a statement I made in a devotional message
last August. I emphasize this point in the authority of the Apostleship:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In the midst of an increasing downpour of devilish devastation across the earth,
you are blessed to be here at one of the Lord&#8217;s Disciple Preparation Centers.
BYU-Idaho is not just a university. You are not merely university students.
Studying here involves much more than taking tests and performing well in
academic classes&#8212;although your academic development and performance truly
are important. But there are essential lessons to be learned and preparations to
be made to this </i>[Disciple Preparation Center] <i>by the Lord&#8217;s latter-day disciples</i>
(Brigham Young University-Idaho Devotional, August 31, 2004).</p>
<p>A key factor that makes BYU-Idaho more than just a university is the power of the collective
invitation that occurs here to receive and to retain the gift of the Holy Ghost and its associated
spiritual gifts&#8212;the demonstration of which we frequently refer to as the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i>.</p>
<p>A key factor that makes you more than mere students or faculty members or employees is the
individual and collective desire to receive and to retain the gift of the Holy Ghost and its
associated spiritual gifts&#8212;the fulfillment of which we often refer to as the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i>.</p>
<p>And the ongoing tribute we pay to Thomas E. Ricks is that the workings of the Holy Ghost in
this sacred and set apart place are affectionately and warmly referred to as the 
		<i>Spirit of Ricks</i>.</p>
<p>May it ever be so. And may each of us have the eyes to see and the ears to hear the workings and
the whisperings of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>I declare my testimony and witness that the Savior lives. I know that my Redeemer lives. He
lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Thomas E. Ricks Building Dedication</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">February 18, 2005</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Elder W. Rolfe Kerr</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Thank you very much, President Wilkes. It is indeed an honor for me to be Elder
Bednar&#8217;s junior companion. Given my age, I am not a junior companion to very many people
anymore.</p>
<p>What a delight it is to be here with Elder and Sister Bednar for this very important and historic
occasion. I would take this opportunity to bear witness in advance to those things to which he
will testify. There is always a place in the Lord&#8217;s work for a second witness, and I am delighted
to offer mine in advance.</p>
<p>You are aware of the marvelous role that Elder Bednar played in the visionary approach that has
been taken in response to the prophetic direction given to this institution. He has played such an
important role. I can sense from the feeling on this campus and from expressions I have heard
the great love that you have for both Elder and Sister Bednar. You can be appropriately proud of
his call to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and know that he is representing you and the Lord
with honor.</p>
<p>BYU-Idaho has a rich tradition, and you are part of it. I even feel somewhat a part of it because
of my wife and her family. My wife&#8217;s brother is here in this room this afternoon. He served many
years ago as student body president at Ricks College. He, my wife, and their sister all graduated
from Ricks and have always and consistently expressed their great love for this institution, for
the faculty who blessed their lives, and for the experiences they had here.</p>
<p>I am reading the history of Ricks College with which most of you will be acquainted, written by
David L. Crowder and entitled <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Spirit of Ricks</span>. It is very clear that this institution&#8217;s trip
through history has not been an easy one. Brother Mark Ricks certainly alluded to that in his
remarks today. Note just a few of the chapter headings in this well-written book: 
		<i>The Church
School in Idaho, Will It Last?; Let&#8217;s Give Ricks to the State; Let&#8217;s Not Give Ricks to the State
		</i>(actually, the title of that chapter is <i>Let&#8217;s Not Give Ricks Away</i>); 
		<i>&#8220;Lambing Sheds&#8221; for a Four-Year College; Junior College Again! In Idaho Falls?; 
		</i>and finally, <i>Can&#8217;t Get Ricks Through the
Rigby Underpass</i>.</p>
<p>Ricks College rose above each of its challenges and survived every threat to its existence. It has
emerged as a marvelous and unique university with unlimited promise and potential for the
future.</p>
<p>Significantly, <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Spirit of Ricks</span>, is dedicated to the memory of Thomas E. Ricks. It was his
vision, as you all know, that lead to the founding of this institution. How fitting it is that this
event today, like so many occasions in the past, should honor Rexburg&#8217;s most prominent pioneer.
It is significant to note that when President Hinckley announced the transition of the college to
university status and to change its name, he said, &#8220;The memory of Thomas E. Ricks will
continue to be appropriately honored and perpetuated.&#8221;</p>
<p>This beautiful building and the adjacent garden are an appropriate and lasting part of that
promise. The profound legacy of Thomas E. Ricks will endure through the object of today&#8217;s
celebration. I am truly honored and blessed to participate in this memorable dedicatory event. I
pray for the Lord&#8217;s blessings upon each of you&#8212;upon the faculty, upon the students, upon the
future of this marvelous institution, and particularly upon the future of this building and what it
will mean to the lives of thousands and thousands of students to come. In the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</p>
<br><br>
http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/MiscellaneousAddresses/2005_02_18_Wilkes.htm
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Thomas E. Ricks Building Dedication</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">February 18, 2005</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Interim President Robert M. Wilkes</span></p>
<p>I am honored to be with you today and particularly pleased that so many descendants of Thomas
E. Ricks have been able to join us&#8212;here and in the various overflow locations. It seems fitting
that the person most singly responsible for this institution&#8217;s beginning and early survival would
be remembered in perpetuity by the single most identifiable garden on campus and the single
new building constructed specifically to address academic needs related to the transition from
Ricks College to Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>In fact, on the several occasions I have been in this building, I have been impressed with what I
have perceived to be intriguing similarities between this building and the transition itself.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that this soon-to-be dedicated Thomas E. Ricks Building is, by intent and design,
a structure without any vestige of opulence or hint of elegance. The nature of this building might
better be described as sinewy and enduring. It manifests the spirit of <i>need 
		</i>as opposed to lure of
<i>desire.</i> In terms of construction, technology, and furnishings, it is impressive and adequate, but
not beyond the mark.</p>
<p>The transition manifests similar characteristics. In spite of the vast sums of money that have
gone into upgrading and expanding the physical campus, the real engine of change has been and
will continue to be people&#8212;faculty, other employees, and especially students. We have faculty
who are first and foremost teachers. They have set aside many of the more exotic assignments
and sought-after perks that more traditional faculty might anticipate as being part of their
professional world. We are blessed by staff and administrators who, in addition to their
respective professional tasks, also regard themselves as teachers. Our students come mostly from
Latter-day Saint homes across the world&#8212;each reflecting their individual family circumstance
with regard to lifestyle, financial and social opportunity, and depth of discipleship; yet they
become bonded as a student body by commonly held values of industry, hard work, thrift, and
faith. President Hinckley once referred to them as &#8220;. . . just simple kids&#8221; (Dedication of the
Gordon B. Hinckley Building, October 22, 2002). They are eager and bright and capable. They
are ordinary, with an inspiring capacity to yield extraordinary results (to paraphrase the late
President John L. Clarke). They, coupled with the building, then become the perfect joining.
&#8220;Simple kids&#8221; learning and growing in a somewhat ordinary building&#8212;a joining which will yet
produce the sought-after extraordinary and meaningful outcomes.</p>
<p>The core intent of Ricks College becoming Brigham Young University-Idaho was to extend the
advantages available here to more students. The number served has already risen significantly
and will continue to increase as we mature and reach our previously announced target of 11,600
students. We offer incentives for them to come, earn their baccalaureate degree, and leave within
the eight semesters typically required. We do that, not because we weary of their presence, but,
rather, in order that more students may enter in at the front end of the educational stream flow.
This new building seems in harmony with that notion of throughput. It makes easy the way for
students to come and go as their schedules dictate. There is space provided here for them to wait
between classes, to appropriately socialize, to progress with essential study, to ponder truths
taught, or to quickly move on to the next requirement of their day.</p>
<p>As with the students themselves, the real beauty of this building will be defined by that which
will occur within. It will be <span style="font-weight: bold">within</span> these walls, as within the minds and hearts of students, that
teachings will inspire, experience will prepare, history will become perspective, practiced values
will install parameters, and worship will become faith and devotion and commitment and
demonstrated testimony.</p>
<p>I express appreciation for those who have contributed in so many ways to the completion of this
facility. To those who represent the architectural and construction firms, as well as the various
subcontractors and consultants, we thank you for your excellent work. We likewise thank our
employees in the Physical Plant, those who participated on the building committee, and all who
have made this dedicatory service possible.</p>
<p>We note, on behalf of the university, our gratitude to the unrecognized tithe payers of the Church
for their offerings, large and small&#8212;some of which were appropriated for the construction of
this, the Thomas E. Ricks Building. I particularly thank the Brigham Young University-Idaho
Board of Trustees for their vision of what we might become and for their generous and patient
support of our efforts to pursue the &#8220;charted course.&#8221; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laurel and I have eagerly looked forward to this visit. We enjoyed the drive up from Salt Lake
City and our first ever tour of the campus. We have heard wonderful reports of progress over the
years concerning this university, reports that started early in the 1970&#8217;s.</p>
<p>During those early years, I served as counselor to Bishop Henry B. Eyring in the Stanford I ward
in Palo Alto California. Later, we became fellow bishops when the ward was divided. I
remember the day well when he was called to be president of Ricks College, leaving his role as
business professor at Stanford and as bishop to the LDS students. It was our loss and your gain. I
rejoined Elder Eyring again in this last decade, serving on several committees together at Church
headquarters. Now, I sit on the Priesthood Executive Council of the Church, to which Elder
David Bednar was recently added. We have benefited greatly from the wisdom of these two
great men who learned much from their experiences at this university. Thank you for preparing
them both for the important roles they now play in the kingdom as Apostles of the Lord. It has
been obvious in our committee interactions that BYU-Idaho is playing an important role in the
Church, being represented by these two men and those who will yet follow.</p>
<p>Last week, I mentioned to Elder Bednar that I was to speak at this devotional. I asked for his
counsel. He said to be careful not to sell you short, that you come prepared to learn, are bright,
spiritual and will recognize eternal truths at the deeper levels. Based on that brief conversation, I
felt impressed to speak on how to learn eternal truths and the rewards for so doing.</p>
<p>I ask that the Spirit of the Lord will be upon us today so that you and I might learn together.
President Marion G. Romney once remarked that speakers, under the influence of the Holy
Ghost might also learn, I quote, <i>&#8220;I always know when I am speaking under the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost because I always learn something from what I&#8217;ve said&#8221; </i>(quoted in Boyd K. Packer,
		<i>Teach Ye Diligently</i>, 1975, 304).</p>
<p>I am here to learn along with you, through the voice of the Spirit. For those who have experience
teaching the Gospel you know that as you speak, related thoughts will come, pushing thoughts
and feelings beyond what was said, both as teacher and as student. That experience comes to you
over time. It is a tool used by the Holy Ghost to teach us all. </p>
<p>So, let us prepare our hearts and minds that the Holy Ghost might teach us today, 
		<i>&#8220;For he will
give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept&#8230;&#8221; </i>through the power of the spirit
(Doctrine and Covenants 98:12).</p>
<p>We begin with a true story of a past Church leader that you likely don&#8217;t know. 
		</p>
<p>On the first day of April Conference, 1924, President Heber J. Grant concluded his opening
remarks by announcing that President Charles W. Penrose, first counselor in the First Presidency
would be the next speaker. President Penrose was 92 years old at the time and somewhat ill. He
was not scheduled to speak at the conference. So, without prior notice he approached the
Tabernacle pulpit to speak. This was a similar situation between President Hinckley and Elder
David B. Haight in last April&#8217;s conference.</p>
<p>I quote President Penrose from the proceedings of that April, 1924 conference,

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Brothers and Sisters, this is not the first time in my life that I have been taken by
surprise. I felt quite content to sit on the stand here this morning and listen to the
words of inspiration that have fallen from the lips of President Heber J. Grant,
feeling that he would occupy most, if not all, of the time. I take great pleasure in
bearing testimony to the truth of the things that he has uttered. Perhaps there is
no need for that. I believe that that testimony is in the hearts of this vast
congregation this morning. I enjoyed every word the President has uttered. I
know that what he has said and read and testified of is true, and it came to us this
morning in the life and power and spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed
to us in these last days. I enjoy meetings of this kind and teachings of this kind.
They are more to my heart and soul than learned disquisitions of any kind.</i></p>
<p>President Penrose then proceeded to spontaneously expound upon many glorious eternal truths.
He covered many topics. His thoughts and words seemed to so easily flow from an almost
limitless reservoir of knowledge and wisdom. He spoke on such topics as:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in">&#160;</p>

Grant as the world&#8217;s prophet
on earth</p>
<p>As you read his remarks, you become aware that he was selecting topics as directed by the Spirit.
It was not rambling nor disjointed. It was a flow of gratitude, doctrinal clarification, exhortation,
personal experiences with a principle, invocation of a blessing and finally a testimony. Granted
that this spontaneous speaking ability comes with practice, however it also requires the Spirit to
give thought, organization, feeling and words to carry it to the minds and hearts of the hearers. 
		</p>
<p>His vast knowledge and testimony of eternal truths allowed the Spirit to select the &#8220;menu&#8221; from
his knowledge and wisdom. A principle here: When we are in tune with the Spirit, it has a way
of telling us what to say and importantly, what not to say. It takes faith to go there. 
		<i>&#8220;I will tell
you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 8:2). It
sometimes comes to your mind and sometimes to your feelings and sometimes to both.</p>
<p>Twelve years earlier, on his eightieth birthday, President Charles W. Penrose was honored by a
celebration at Church headquarters. President Joseph F. Smith, the president of the Church at the
time made a rather astounding remark about President Penrose: <i>&#8220;No prophet, ancient or modern,
knows so much of the gospel of Jesus Christ as Charles W. Penrose&#8221; </i>(Frank W. Penrose, &#8220;A
Tribute to Charles W. Penrose,&#8221; Young Women&#8217;s Journal (July 1925) 36:405).</p>
<p>That is a remarkable statement coming from one of our Church presidents who knew President
Penrose so intimately and was himself one of the Church&#8217;s great scholars and doctrinaires.</p>
<p>It turns out that President Penrose is not well known in today&#8217;s Church membership. He was a
&#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; counselor in the First Presidency. He was known as a clarifier of doctrine on
behalf of the First Presidency. He was looked upon to keep the doctrine pure in the Church. He
reviewed the correctness of doctrines both taught and written by past and contemporary leaders
of the Church, including works of Parley P. Pratt, B.H. Roberts, and James E. Talmage to name a
few. He crafted many of the declaration of doctrines issued under the authority of the First
Presidency.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>President Penrose never liked to write down talks but to let the Spirit guide. I wonder how he
would have handled the world of broadcasting and the requisite Teleprompters, like the ones I
am using today.</p>
<p>Teleprompters can be seeming, &#8220;spirit killers.&#8221; They can be awkward to use. Once you start, you
feel chained to the words on the glass. </p>
<p>I changed my mind about Teleprompters, as I worked on the productions of the Worldwide
Leadership training broadcasts. I now realize that fasting, prayer, study, research and multiple
drafting do bring the Spirit into the text, as if it were scripture. It is speaking by the spirit even
though the skill of delivery varies. It now becomes the audience&#8217;s responsibility to listen by the
Spirit and to study it out in their own minds. I hope you get my message here! 
		</p>
<p>How often have you listened to a talk, thinking it was rather uneventful, only to read it later and
be amazed at how much you missed! Remember the dual responsibility:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And again, he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the Spirit of
truth or some other way? </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If it be some other way it is not of God. 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, why is it that we cannot understand and know, that he that receiveth
the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 50:19-21). </p>
<p>Was the talk not relevant to our interests or were we just listening by &#8220;some other way?&#8221;</p>
<p>You may be asking about now, &#8220;Why does Elder Miller start his remarks by talking of a
somewhat obscure member of the First Presidency?&#8221; I will now tell you.</p>
<p>If you and I can understand the process of learning eternal truths used by President Penrose, we
might find a useful roadmap for ourselves. Secondly, President Penrose happens to be my great,
great, grandfather. I have read and reread his diaries and his teachings, trying to learn from them.
The added value that our forefathers bring to us is not only to patch together our family sealing
line but also to learn from them. It gives additional meaning to the spiritual magnet that turns the
hearts of the children to the fathers. We learn from their lives, a tradition of eternal learning
since the days of Adam. I have been inspired by the teachings and life accounts of Grampa
Penrose. They have taught me much about how he learned eternal truths.</p>
<p>Even the Son of God received a fullness from His Father. He <i>&#8220;received not of the fullness at
first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fullness&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants
93:12-13) We have several quotes from the Savior himself on how he learned,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son
can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things so
ever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise</i> (John 5: 19).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things</i>
(John 8:28).</p>
<p>We admire how the Savior and the prophets, old and modern, who wrote, spoke and still speak
by the Spirit. The right of passage seems to be in the price of righteous living. They maintain a
constant state of &#8220;readiness&#8221; to receive, to teach and to discern by the Spirit. I see this happen
most days as I work with the other General Authorities. Rest assured my young brothers and
sisters, revelation continues to be a daily occurrence in this Church.</p>
<p>It takes work and discipline to learn, teach and discern eternal truths by the Spirit. The Prophet
Joseph suggests how to start; <i>&#8220;A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of
revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden
strokes of ideas&#8221; </i>(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith 1976, 151).</p>
<p>My interpretation of his clue on learning eternal truths through inspiration is that it is an acquired
ability. You must work at it. It builds upon itself and becomes easier as any tool brought by
discipline. </p>
<p>There is an intriguing expression in Latter-day scriptures as to the process of learning eternal
truths. Three examples come to mind:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When Joseph commented on the affect of his and Oliver Cowdery&#8217;s experience of the
Holy Ghost after their baptism he said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><i>Our minds now being enlightened, we began to have the scriptures
laid open to our understandings, and the true meaning and
intention of their more mysterious passages revealed to us in a
manner which we never could attain to previously, nor ever before
thought of</i> (JS-H 74).</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When the Prophet Joseph and Sidney Rigdon had the heavens opened to them for an hour
or so in the John Johnson farm at Hiram, Ohio, he said of the experience, <i>&#8220;By the power
of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see
and understand the things of God&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 76:12). </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.5in">3.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When President Joseph F. Smith wrote of his experiences of seeing the spirit world in
some detail he described the process, <i>&#8220;As I pondered over these things 
		</i>(scriptures on the
atonement and the Spirit world)<i>, the eyes of my understanding were opened and the Spirit
of the Lord rested upon me.&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 138: 11)</p>
<p>&#160;Do we again see a pattern here? In each case, the prophets were pondering scripture, asking
questions and then, having the eyes of their understanding opened. That is a major method to
learn eternal truths. The eyes of our understanding are opened to see the &#8220;mysteries&#8221; of the
scriptures and to learn of eternal truths and how to fit them together.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Savior, Joseph Smith, Charles Penrose and many others who have learned
eternal truths at the deeper levels, came from very humble, earthly circumstances.</p>
<p>We do not have to be highly educated to gain high levels of learning eternal things, although it
certainly helps. C.S. Lewis gives us this thought: <i>&#8220;Anyone who is honestly trying to be a
Christian will soon find his intelligence being sharpened. One of the reasons why it needs no
special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself&#8221; 
		</i>(<i>Mere Christianity</i>
pg.61).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look closely at why that is true. To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said, 
		<i>&#8220;Behold, thou knowest
that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that
thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 6:15). Becoming enlightened suggests that we are filled with light. We often say,
&#8220;Ah, a light bulb went off!&#8221; Actually, something more profound takes place when that light
comes from God. </p>
<p>When eternal light (meaning eternal truth) comes to us through the Holy Ghost it works an
important transformation in us. This transformation is a continuing growth process, if we give
room to it.</p>
<p>Parley P. Pratt expresses it this way, speaking of a man who receives light through the Holy
Ghost, <i>&#8220;His mind is quickened, and his intellectual faculties are aroused to intense activity. He
is, as it were, illuminated. He learns more of divine truth in a few days than he could have
learned in a lifetime in the best merely human institution of the world&#8221; 
		</i>(<i>Key to the Science of
Theology</i>, pg. 56-60).</p>
<p>So, we know how it works at the start. It is the spirit of Christ within us. Now here, please follow
me into the so-called mysteries of the scriptures. We read in Doctrine and Covenants 84:45-47:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever
is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit
enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the
Spirit. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even
the Father.</i></p>
<p>As we illuminate this spirit it draws us to truth. In turn, truth begets more truth. 
		<i>&#8220;For intelligence
cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue;
light cleaveth unto light&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:40). Like a spiritual magnet, we begin to
attract all forms of truth into one great whole. As the scriptures state, this also brings us not only
closer to God but brings us into God, figuratively speaking, meaning the spirit of truth resides
within us. His light now becomes our light and we are transformed as a result.</p>
<p>It not only illuminates our minds and our hearts, it literally transforms who and what we are.
Often, we don&#8217;t notice the change. Even those who know us well don&#8217;t immediately notice. The
change is often imperceptible, on a day-to-day basis. It is important to understand what God is
doing for us and with us. As we absorb more light and truth, we become more like Him. As we
become more like Him, we ourselves are filled with a light that is no longer just a temporary
reflective light but a permanent source of light on spiritual matters. </p>
<p>Learning eternal truths is more than intellectual acquisition; the study, analysis and explanation
of doctrinal facts. That&#8217;s what scholars do. That&#8217;s what we think we are supposed to do in a
Sunday school or a university religion class. </p>
<p>It is even more than gaining a spiritual confirmation during moments of scriptural exploration
and discovery.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if a scripture can explain it better for us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, -- in
the wilderness, because you cannot see him--my voice, because my voice is Spirit;
my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall
abound. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light,
and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light
comprehendeth all things. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the
days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it
shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:66-68).</p>
<p>Do you see the connection of acquiring eternal truths, being transformed by those truths with the
result that you acquire the capacity to participate in God&#8217;s glory? <i>&#8220;For behold, this is my work
and my glory - to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&#8221; 
		</i>(Moses 1: 39). </p>
<p>I believe that something much more profound happens to us as we acquire an understanding of
Eternal Truths and as we assimilate them into our being. I believe that it is something added to
you and me as we build a relationship with God; in fact it is the undeniable and ultimate result of
that relationship.</p>
<p>It is a transcending process in which you as a child of God become more like him because He is
coming to you through your absorption of Eternal Truths. Again, it is not just a knowledge
acquisition nor is it only a relationship with the Savior - it is both.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free&#8221; 
		</i>(John 8:32).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself
unto us, and not unto the world?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Jesus answered and said unto him, &#8220;If a man love me, he will keep my words: and
my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with
him (John 14:22-23).</i></p>
<p>When we come to accept and assimilate and practice the truths of the Gospel we come closer to
God and the Savior. These truths abide in us and slowly they come to make their abode with us
as the Personification of truth and spirit.</p>
<p>It is the process by which truth becomes a part of your being, body and soul. Each learned
eternal truth taken in and acted upon redefines you. You are not the same person, even though
you may look the same to everyone else.</p>
<p>The light that accompanies the new truths you acquire changes your very character, including
your countenance. It does not leave you unless you deliberately move away from that light. It
may be imperceptive, but it changes you forever. </p>
<p>Now, I think there is something important about that process of the connection between Spirit,
truth, sanctification and, having light that comprehendeth all things. I have for years missed the
import of what the Lord is saying here.</p>
<p>Brigham Young added this thought, <i>&#8220;It (the Holy Ghost) shows them things past, present, and to
come. It opens the vision of the mind, unlocks the treasures of wisdom, and they begin to
understand the things of God&#8230; They comprehend themselves and the great object of their
existence&#8221; </i>(<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 1:241).</p>
<p>I have a tiny glimpse now of how to learn as Grampa Penrose learned and how all the prophets
learned.</p>
<p>Now, I have thrown a lot of ideas at you, probably too much. Elder Bednar said you were a
pretty bright bunch of people so I took him at his word.</p>
<p>By way of summary, let&#8217;s review some of the principles involved in learning eternal truths:</p>

<p>Good Afternoon, Brothers and Sisters. I am so happy to be here with you. Thank you for your
cheerful faces and the kind spirit you bring with you. I have been looking forward to this
moment since the day, months ago, when I was asked to speak. I have been excited to fulfill this
assignment, and I have also felt somewhat anxious about serving you well in the time that we
will have together. I have carefully prepared a message for you and have fasted and prayed for
help and guidance to be able to do so in a way that would be pleasing to our Heavenly Father. I
pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost and ask you to join me in this prayer: that each of
us may invite the Holy Ghost to be with us, that he may bring things to our remembrance and
teach us truth.</p>
<p>I am going to start my message by sharing my testimony. While this is not customary, I would
like you to know what I believe before you receive my message. I know that we have a Father in
Heaven who loves us; who loves us so much that He provided a plan for us, which is a plan of
happiness. If we are faithful, we may become as He is and return to Him to live with Him
forever. I know Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He lived as a perfect example for us. He atoned
for our sins and he is absolutely aware of our weaknesses and trials. He also knows all that is
wonderful and divine within each of us. He died for us, and he rose to live again for us. We may
follow him, serve him, and become like him, and by so doing we may return to our Father in
Heaven. I know that Jesus Christ lives and that he loves me; I know that he loves each of us. He
is our elder brother, our truest friend, our Savior and our Redeemer.</p>
<p>Because Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us, they have not left us to fend for ourselves in a
world where there is very real opposition to the plan of salvation. They have not left us alone in a
world that tests us and tries us. They are not silent or distant. The Holy Ghost will testify of truth
and will teach us; he will guide us in all righteousness and he will strengthen and comfort us.</p>
<p>I know the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ is found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that Christ stands as the Head of his church. Prophets have always been raised up
and called of God to teach and lead God&#8217;s children in obeying the commandments, that they may
be blessed. I know Joseph Smith was called of God to be a prophet, and that he faithfully and
obediently restored the fullness of the gospel to the earth. The prophet Joseph was an authorized
servant of God who held the keys of the priesthood, and the prophets of the Church who have
followed him were also authorized servants. I know that Gordon B. Hinckley is God&#8217;s chosen
prophet on the earth today, and those who serve with President Hinckley have also been prepared
and called by God. I know that the Book of Mormon is true and that it was prepared and brought
forth to us by prophets of God. I love the Book of Mormon and all of the Holy Scriptures, both
ancient and modern, that have been provided to us by a perfectly kind and loving Father in
Heaven. I have searched and studied and prayed over these things. I have had questions and have
pondered things that I did not always understand. I have learned much and still have much to
learn, and I look forward to that process. I have come to know that these things which I have
spoken are true, and I testify of that to you, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You may wonder why I started with my testimony rather than ending with it, and the simple
answer is because it seemed like the right thing to do. Perhaps, another reason would be that I
like to eat my dessert first. So, today I decided to give you dessert first because some of the
sweetest words I can speak to you are the words of my testimony.</p>
<p>When I first received the assignment to speak, I was very surprised. I thought, &#8220;If only this had
come when I was older, wiser, more knowledgeable, and more prepared&#8212;then it would be so
much better.&#8221; Fortunately, I was quickly blessed with a sense of peace and comfort. I realized
that this assignment wasn&#8217;t so much about me, or at least that wasn&#8217;t where my focus should be.
Instead, my focus needed to be on serving the Lord and you, and I realized that I did not need to
be afraid. Although I have been anxious to serve well, still I have been remarkably blessed to
feel at peace and truly joyful about this opportunity. I quickly came to love and appreciate the
blessings I received in the preparation process, so when the date of my talk was moved from
April to March, I had mixed feelings. On one hand, I was sorry there would be fewer days that I
would experience these blessings; because I was truly blessed to receive help that came 
		<i>&#8220;line
upon line and precept upon precept&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 28:30). On the other hand, I was really excited to
see you and be here in this moment with you, so I was glad it would come more quickly.
Occasionally, I would still feel a little worried about talking. One day when I was visiting with
two friends, I told them I felt like I should be older and more prepared to do this. I said
something silly like, &#8220;I&#8217;m too young to do this!&#8221; One of my friends immediately said that, &#8220;You
don&#8217;t need to worry about that because you will probably seem old to the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had a good laugh, and it was the reality check I needed to stay focused. I hope you will stay
focused today, not so much on me, but on what the Spirit of God would teach you during this
time. I am counting on you to look and listen beyond the limitations of my words and to make
the next 25 minutes really matter for yourself. Because of my work here on campus, I see you
each day and I know who you are. I know I can trust you to understand my heart if my words
aren&#8217;t adequate. I hope you will take notes today, but I hope you will note the words that come to
your heart and mind not just the words I use.</p>
<p>When I thought about what I should speak on today, a scripture came to my mind quickly and
very clearly. It was 2 Nephi 25: 26. These are the words of the prophet Nephi: 
		<i>&#8220;And we talk of
Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according
to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of
their sins.&#8221; </i>This is a truly wonderful verse that could be greatly expounded upon. The specific
thought that came to me was the first two phrases, <i>&#8220;we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ.&#8221;</i>
These words will be the focus of my remarks today. There are so many things that we could
speak of when we talk of Christ. I have selected two points; first, the taking of His name upon us
through the ordinance of baptism, and second, using repentance and the gift of the Atonement as
we try to be like Jesus. After these comments, I will make one point about rejoicing in Christ.</p>
<p>In Mosiah Chapter 18, specifically in verses 7-11 we learn more about the ordinance of baptism
through the story of the prophet Alma:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered
together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were
gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them,
and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of
Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the
fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another&#8217;s
burdens, that they may be light;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that
stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all
things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be
redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye
may have eternal life.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now I say unto you if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against
being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have
entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his
commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for
joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</i></p>
<p>This can be the desire of our hearts every Sabbath day when we renew our baptismal covenants
through the taking of the sacrament. It can be the desire of our hearts every day, all day, to stand
as witnesses of God. What are the desires of your heart? Will you take a moment now to answer
that in your heart and mind?</p>
<p>When I was younger, I mostly wanted to do what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it. Maybe a
few of you can relate to that. Since then, I have come to know more about the importance of the
ordinance of baptism and the sacred covenants that are made at that time and the priceless Gift of
the Holy Ghost which we receive through priesthood authority. I have come to know more about
the importance of offering a broken heart and a contrite spirit to the Lord, and I understand better
the value of renewing my covenants by taking the sacrament each week. I still want to do what I
want to do, but the desires of my heart have changed. I want to serve my Father in Heaven; I
want to seek and understand his will; I want to be obedient and faithful in all that He would have
me do; I want to follow Jesus Christ; I want to be like Him; I want to love each of you as my
brothers and my sisters the way He does; I want to show Him that I am grateful for what He has
done for me; and, I want to always remember that I have taken His name upon me. I want to
stand as a witness for him &#8220;at all times and in all things, and in all places.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ask you again, &#8220;What are the desires of your heart?&#8221; I know your lives are busy, but we can&#8217;t
allow ourselves to be distracted from the really important things in life. The verses we have read
in Mosiah can teach us so much and they deserve our consideration. I hope you will make the
time to consider these verses more very soon. If you do, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll learn much more that
will be a blessing to you.</p>
<p>I would like to talk a little more about the taking of Christ&#8217;s name upon us and what that can do
to the desires of our hearts. The words of the scriptures do this better than I can, so turn with me
to Mosiah Chapter 5, looking at several verses starting with verse 2. This is the response of the
people to the words of the prophet, King Benjamin, after he has preached the gospel of Jesus
Christ to them:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which
thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of
the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in
our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good
continually.</i></p>
<p>&#160;Reading on in verse 5,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be
obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the
remainder of our days&#8230;.</i></p>
<p>Here is King Benjamin&#8217;s response to the people, starting in verse 6 and continuing on,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the
children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath
spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on
his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and daughters.</i></p>
<p>Now a little further into verse 8 we read, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that
ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the
covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</i></p>
<p>And, continuing in verse 15, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding
in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you
may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life,
through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all
things in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.</i></p>
<p>These verses help us understand what can happen when we take the name of Christ upon
ourselves and what the end results will be if we keep our covenants.</p>
<p>A thought expressed in the last verse leads me into my second point about using repentance and
the gift of the Atonement to help us try to be more like Jesus. Jesus Christ is &#8220;steadfast and
immovable.&#8221; He is the perfect example for us to follow, and we can try to be like him every day.
In this, I am aware that I fall far short. Our Savior is perfectly loving, patient, and kind, and I am
not. He is complete in every way, and I am not. This comparison could go on and on but it would
all end with the words, &#8220;and I am not.&#8221; But, I can be, someday, if I am true and faithful to my
covenants and remain steadfast. Because I&#8217;m trying to be like Jesus, I am a better person than I
once was and I hope to become better still.</p>
<p>When I was quite young, I heard a talk given by a leader in the Church. I do not remember who
he was or even the setting of the talk. Although I cannot give proper credit to him, I think he
would be glad to know that an idea remained with me. He said he asked for forgiveness from the
Lord every day and that he needed to repent every day. It may surprise you to know that I just
did not get that, at all. I couldn&#8217;t really comprehend that the person who was speaking would
actually be doing anything for which he needed to repent of every day. At the time, I had a very
simple understanding of sin and I thought repentance was just for serious problems. I also
thought that it was very uncomfortable and unpleasant to go through, so I certainly did not want
to subject myself to it on a daily basis; I cringed at the thought. Even though I could not really
accept what I had heard, the idea didn&#8217;t go away. It bugged me from time to time through my
teenage years and into my early twenties, and I&#8217;m using the term &#8220;bugged&#8221; intentionally. I would
like you to think about what it feels like to have a little ant or bug crawling somewhere on your
skin. It&#8217;s not harmful, but it really gets your attention, and then you swat it away as fast as you
can. That is what this idea was like for me. Then I learned more about Jesus Christ, the gift of his
Atonement, the purpose of repentance, and the miracle of forgiveness. I learned more about a lot
of things. I came to know that my Heavenly Father does live and he loves me and wants me to be
able to return to him. I came to know that Jesus Christ does live and he loves me so much that he
would atone for my sins and he would redeem me. I learned more about the gift of the Holy
Ghost and why this is a truly priceless gift. The Holy Ghost can reveal to us the truth of our
actions so that we may see every day the things we need to correct and the faults within
ourselves that we must mend as we try to be like Jesus. The longer and more consistently we
invite the tutoring of the Holy Ghost, the more refined our vision of ourselves becomes and our
sensitivity to what is right and what is wrong is greatly increased.</p>
<p>So, in this life we may never run out of things to correct through repentance as the Holy Ghost
diligently works to help us try to become more and more like Jesus. The idea that speaker left
with me doesn&#8217;t &#8220;bug&#8221; me anymore. It comes back to me all the time, but now I welcome it like
a brilliant little butterfly landing on my outstretched hand. In other words, I don&#8217;t swat it away
but take great delight in it. The concept of frequent, sincere repentance and personal reflection
has become beautiful to me. And, I do need it daily because I am mindful of things now that I
didn&#8217;t used to be mindful of. I think when I am a little white-haired and wrinkly lady that I will
still be refining myself through repentance. I hope by then I&#8217;ll be a righteous example in
everything I do and say and think, but I&#8217;ll probably still have things to work on within myself.
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll still be learning the things we have all come here to learn. I hope I will make
progress and prepare every day of my life for the moment when I meet my elder brother and
Savior again. I don&#8217;t know when that moment will come. I want to be ready. I don&#8217;t want to be
afraid to see him. I just want to be happy to see him again. I want to be able to look into his eyes
and see joy. What do you want that moment to be like?</p>
<p>In trying to be like Jesus, we will often be very aware of how far short we fall from his example.
The ability to see this gap between ourselves and how we could be and should be is a gift from
God. If we can&#8217;t see what separates us from where we want to be, how will we ever overcome
the obstacles to get there? The adversary would try to use our awareness of this gap to depress
and discourage us. He would whisper a lie to us that we will never be able to overcome the
obstacles or the distance. He would like nothing better than for us to drown in defeat and cringe
at the thought of frequently, humbly, prayerfully going to our loving Father in Heaven in the
name of the Savior to ask, specifically and mindfully, for forgiveness, and to ask for help and
strength to do better. Jesus Christ will help us bridge the gap. He will help us overcome the
obstacles. It will require our most honest effort, but He will bring us to stand steadfast with him
someday if we will turn to him and apply the power of the Atonement in our lives every day.
When we talk of Christ there are so many things that merit our attention; I hope you will
understand why I&#8217;ve chosen these points.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m going to make one point about rejoicing in Christ. The callings and assignments that
teach and stretch us help us become better able to serve our Father in Heaven. I believe you will
find this to be true for yourself. I have been a teacher for Primary and Young Women a number
of times and have loved serving in both organizations. These callings have been easy to accept
and have felt very natural.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was called to be a chorister in the Primary. When the counselor in the
bishopric extended the call, I was stunned and thought there had been a mistake. I told him I had
very little musical training and was not much of a singer. I wasn&#8217;t being modest, just very
honest. He was quiet for a moment and then he pressed forward and said that sometimes it is
good for us to be stretched. I accepted the call and got stretched! I experienced some difficult
moments, but there were also wonderful moments, which grew to be more and more frequent
and meaningful. I had been serving for about seven months when I really started to love serving
in this calling. I was released three weeks later. It was then that I realized I had not served in the
way I wished I would have. I realized I could have made the decision to love my calling from the
very beginning even though it was sometimes hard and I often felt inadequate. I promised myself
never to make that mistake with a calling again. Then ten months ago I got my chance to prove
it. In my current calling I serve as the music director in sacrament meeting, and I have loved this
calling from the moment it was extended. At first I was so nervous I would run out of breath in
the middle of a phrase and would just have to mouth the words while I breathed in. Sometimes I
would concentrate so hard on what my hand was doing that I would loose track of the verse we
were singing. I freely admit that I am not the most accomplished music director you&#8217;ll see, but I
love my calling. I wasn&#8217;t put in these callings because I had musical talent or training. Instead, I
am slowly learning and developing because of the callings. I will be forever grateful for this
opportunity, and I sincerely love to study the words of the hymns and the referenced scriptures.</p>
<p>Through this, my understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been deepened in a way I did
not anticipate. I was not even really aware of what I was missing out on before I began to study
and really sing sacred music. I sang every week in church and enjoyed hymns casually, but a
whole new world has opened up to me now. The reason I have shared this experience with you is
so you will understand that I have just recently discovered that one of the best ways to rejoice in
Christ is through the study and singing of hymns. Many of you already know this, but some
don&#8217;t. For those who haven&#8217;t yet discovered a deep appreciation of sacred music, I hope today
you will begin to look at the hymns with a desire to learn and understand more. I had no idea the
hymns could provide the strength, comfort, and peace that they do. I had no idea how effective
an instrument of teaching they could be. Think about the Primary songs we sing as children. If
some of you did not experience Primary, you do not have to feel left out. You can still have your
own Primary experience. You don&#8217;t even have to wait for a Primary calling because all you have
to do is put your name on the list of people who are willing to be substitutes. I promise you will
get all the opportunities you would ever want. I&#8217;m going to read just a few of the titles of
Primary songs, so we can see what we learn from them, and how they make us feel, and how
they help us rejoice in Christ:</p>

<p>Does that bring back some memories for you? Do you remember how you felt when you sang
those songs as a child? Try singing them again or for the first time as an adult. The feelings will
be there. The best part of being a Primary chorister is seeing the children rejoice in Christ and his
gospel through song. It was the part of my calling that I could appreciate from the very start. If
you can&#8217;t, don&#8217;t, or won&#8217;t sing, you can still be blessed through listening and rejoicing in what
you hear. Think about one of your favorite hymns or sacred songs. Why do you like it? What
does it mean to you? How do you feel when you listen to it? And when you sing it? If you don&#8217;t
have a favorite hymn, you need one. One is an essential start, and then you&#8217;ll find your list of
favorites will grow and grow. Think about what we are taught in Doctrine and Covenants
Section 25: 12-13. These are the words of the Lord:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart: yea, the song of the righteous is a
prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou
hast made.</i></p>
<p>&#160;These are simply beautiful words for us to hear. I&#8217;m going to read a short list of hymn titles and
I would like you to think about how we rejoice in Christ through these sacred pieces of music:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Spirit of God</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We Thank Thee, O God, For a Prophet</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Joseph Smith&#8217;s First Prayer</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Come, Come Ye Saints</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Where Can I Turn for Peace?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I Believe in Christ</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I Know That My Redeemer Lives</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I Stand All Amazed</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>How Great the Wisdom and the Love</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Lord, I Would Follow Thee</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There is Sunshine in My Soul Today</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Love At Home</i></p>
<p>Many of you are familiar with these songs. As you heard these titles, you may have remembered
some of the wonderful feelings the hymns bring. These memories can communicate with you
better than my words can. When our hearts are opened by sacred music, the Holy Ghost can
teach us about Christ and the truths of his gospel. This truly is rejoicing in Christ.</p>
<p>In conclusion today, would you please consider and answer a few questions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What has the Holy Ghost taught me today?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What do I need to learn more about?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">How can I learn it?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Is there something I need to do differently in my life?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What are the desires of my heart?</p>
<p>Think more about these questions and your answers in the coming week. Think about the things
you have felt while you chose to spend your time here.</p>
<p>Now, I am going to give you a second helping of dessert, which you know is my testimony. In
Moroni Chapter 10, we are told that <i>&#8220;by the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all
things&#8221;</i> (Moroni 10:5). I believe that I can obtain a more certain knowledge from the witness of
the Holy Ghost than I can from the combined total of my physical senses. I know Jesus Christ
lives and that he is our Savior. The Holy Ghost testifies to my heart and mind of this truth. I
would talk of Christ and rejoice in him all my life. He loves us, and I love you as my brothers
and my sisters. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </p>

</p>
<p>I am honored to be with you today. You are truly an impressive sight. The warm welcome and
gracious hospitality we have received have been overwhelming and touching. I express my
appreciation to President and Sister Wilkes for inviting Sister Stucki and me to come and meet
you, to feel of your spirit, and to permit me to share some of my thoughts with you.
		</p>
<p>This quiet, beautiful setting against the mountains gives one the feeling of solitude, of safety,
protected from the challenges of a world of confusion, uncertainty and violence. 
		</p>
<p>You are blessed with a special peaceful institution of learning where personal plans can be
designed and preparations made for a life of accomplishment, happiness, and eternal rewards. 
		</p>
<p>It is my desire to provide some useful thoughts that may be of help to each of you as you look
beyond the horizon of this day. I want to encourage and motivate you to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">learn</span> and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">know:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1. Who you are and why you are here.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2. What your talents and gifts are and what you can accomplish and become.

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">3. I want to give you a clear understanding that &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">You Decide your Destiny</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I emphasize the words<i> <span style="font-weight: bold">learn</span></i> and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>know</i></span><i> </i>because I believe our life here in mortality is subject to
outside influences and continuing change. As we <span style="font-weight: bold">
<i>learn</i></span> through the various opportunities
available to us, our perceptions and beliefs change, and we can truly develop a sure 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>knowledge</i></span>
of our purpose. We can use our knowledge, talents and gifts to rise to the expectations we have
set for ourselves, but more importantly, the <span style="font-weight: bold">expectations our Heavenly Father has for us.</span>
</p>
<p>The scriptures teach us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them
which are expedient unto man. <span style="font-weight: bold">And they are free to choose liberty and eternal
life</span>, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death,
according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men
might be miserable like unto himself. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, my sons,

<p>Further guidance is given to us: </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived

<p>Let me share with you a true story of a young man by the name of Layne Johnson. I have
received permission to share his life with you.</p>
<p>Layne Johnson is the son of Sheldon and Leatrice Johnson. They were our neighbors for more
than 40 years, living in our ward, in St. George, Utah. Layne was born on September 17, 1954.
He is the second child, having one older brother, and three younger brothers.</p>
<p>Layne was born handicapped, diagnosed with Down Syndrome. His parents were told that Layne
would never be able to live a normal life, that he would not be able to learn to take care of
himself, that he would not be able to go to school, and that he probably would live in a
vegetative state, placing a terrible stigma and burden upon his parents and family. Sheldon and
Leatrice were advised to place Layne in an institution and forget him. They were told there are
places for babies like Layne who would never speak, or read, or understand, or have dreams and
goals of their own.</p>
<p>Sheldon and Leatrice could not, and did not do that. Instead, they decided to raise him in their
family, with the same family rules and expectations of him that were required of all his brothers. 
		</p>
<p>Over the many months of adolescence they worked with him, giving him chores to do, expecting
him to do his part.They did not excuse him from tasks he was able to do, but expected him to try
to learn and to develop to the fullest of his abilities. He was subject to the same loving discipline
as his brothers.</p>
<p>Layne grew up in the neighborhood with all the rest of the children, doing his best, and all his
friends, including my children, loved him, and helped him. They did not belittle him, but they
accepted him, encouraged him and cheered him on. Layne went to Primary and to a special
elementary school which his parents helped to organize.</p>
<p>He worked on the farm with his father and brothers. While working on the farm, he learned to
operate the farm equipment and continued to develop his mechanical knowledge and skills. He
learned to water ski and participated in many other sports, competing in the Special Olympics
where he did very well. He loved to go fishing with the family where he claims to have caught
the biggest fish.</p>
<p>I became the bishop of the ward, and I was privileged to watch Layne continue in his
progression. Layne received the Melchizedek Priesthood and was ordained an Elder. He received
his endowments, and he went to the temple regularly. He filled every priesthood assignment with
such diligence that few could match his commitment and faithful performance in the work of the
Lord.</p>
<p>On June 7, 1977, he received a call to serve a special short-term mission to the Philippines
Manila Mission where his brother Kris was serving. Layne, accompanied by his father and
mother, went to the Philippines. There he faithfully served his mission as his brother&#8217;s
companion until both Layne&#8217;s and his brother&#8217;s mission was completed. Then they all returned
home together.</p>
<p>He earned his Eagle Scout Award on May 15, 1983, and continued to earn additional merit
badges until he had more than any of his brothers. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, seeing Layne&#8217;s
picture in the local newspaper, wrote him a letter (dated July 21, 1983) from which I quote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Dear Layne,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">I was delighted to read in a recent issue of the Washington County news that you
had received your Eagle Scout award. That is a wonderful accomplishment in
your life and I don&#8217;t know who looked prouder &#8211;you or your parents. However,
looking at all those merit badges nearly gave me a headache. How on earth did
you get all those! I&#8217;ll bet you know more than any Boy Scout in the country. I
always look forward to coming to priesthood meeting in the Third Ward where
you so superbly lead the singing.</p>
<p>Layne had a remarkable musical talent. He learned to play the organ, and he was called to serve
as the chorister for the ward priesthood meeting. He served faithfully leading the singing in the
ward priesthood meeting for more than 25 years. </p>
<p>Layne was faithful in his callings; and he could not be tempted by adversity, deceptive persons,
or the devil. On one occasion, I asked Layne if we could sing &#8220;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8221; for our
opening hymn in our priesthood meeting. He said to me, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Oh Bishop, you know we can&#8217;t sing
that song! It is not in the hymn book.&#8221;</span> Layne could not be tempted and would not do anything
that was not right. He knew how our Savior lived His life, and Layne was committed to live his
life like Jesus.</p>
<p>Layne got a job with J. C. Penny Company in St. George, where he worked in the stockroom for
more than 25 years. He was a trusted employee there; having his own key he would arrive early
to prepare for each day&#8217;s business. At the time of his retirement, he received a gold watch in
appreciation for his many years of faithful employment.</p>
<p>Because of his job requirements, Layne found it necessary to have his own transportation. So he
saved his money, purchased a motor scooter, learned to drive it, and obtained his license to drive
it in traffic on the highways. He later purchased a car, and again demonstrated his ability to drive
and obtained his driver&#8217;s license. He has driven his car over 40,000 miles without an accident.</p>
<p>Like most men, Layne had an interest in sports, and he became a fan of John Stockton of the
Utah Jazz. He even had the opportunity to meet John and have his picture taken with him on the
basketball floor. <span style="font-weight: bold">He carefully chose his idols, seeking those who were living righteous lives.</span>
He was overcoming the handicap that he was born with.</p>
<p>Leatrice, Layne&#8217;s mother, died from cancer in January of 1991 and Layne was filled with grief
and loneliness. Those were difficult times for Layne. He felt alone. His brothers all had loving
wives as their companions and he greatly missed and was 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">seeking the comfort and love that
only a mother or a wife can provide.</span> His father later married again, and his new stepmother,
LaVerna, was a special loving mother and she gave understanding support and encouragement to
Layne. She filled the void in Layne&#8217;s life and was a great encouragement and motivator for him. 
		</p>
<p>As time passed, the Lord, through his family and friends, provided the opportunity for Layne to
meet Shauna Nichols. She also was a Down Syndrome child. She too had worked hard and
achieved skills, knowledge and ability equal to that of Layne. They were both attracted to each
other and they dated and became better acquainted over time. They decided they would like to be
married and live their lives together in their own home independent of their parents. With the
blessings of both parents, and after careful planning, they were married in the St. George Temple
on the 26<sup>th</sup> of November, 1993. They began their married life with an eternal everlasting
covenant to become one in harmony with our Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan. Shauna is a beautiful
young wife, and she has that beauty clear through her body, heart, and soul.</p>
<p>Layne has had his greatest dream fulfilled. He has the loving wife he has long awaited.</p>
<p>The blessing of an eternal companion was provided to a righteous young man by our Heavenly
Father. They presently live in St. George in a new home which they planned and built. They are
active in the Church, holding callings, attending the temple regularly, and they are a model of
righteousness. Sister Stucki made the observation to me that 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">they &#8220;are pure in heart.&#8221;</span> The Lord
has sealed them up unto Him!</p>
<p>Layne and Shauna have become known throughout the world for their success in overcoming the
handicaps of Down Syndrome. They have been invited and have spoken at many prestigious
forums on Down Syndrome at state and national levels. Many articles have been written about
them. A DVD on the lives of Layne and Shauna has been produced and distributed to special
institutions that work with and strive to improve the lives of those who are mentally
disadvantaged.</p>
<p>When I last visited with Layne and Shauna in January of this year, they told me they were happy,
and everything is going very well for them. As I spoke with them, my thoughts took me back to
the old fairy tale ending of <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;and they lived happily ever after.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">I would wish for each of you, &#8220;that you will live happily ever after.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Layne and Shauna have used their gifts and talents to nearly 100% of their capacity. That
is why they have largely overcome the huge handicap they were born with. I believe the
Lord will bless them greatly for how they have used their very limited gifts to meet their
full potential in their mission here on earth. </span></p>
<p>I would now like to talk about you. I am impressed with your commitment to gain knowledge
and to improve yourself. <span style="font-weight: bold">That is a most worthy and commendable goal.</span>
</p>
<p>&#160;As students, you may think (as most of us do) in terms of the monetary gain or return on the
investment you will spend for your education. Many studies have been made which confirm the
great value of seeking higher education. History has proven that the knowledge you can gain
from this great university will bring financial rewards many, many multiples greater than the
cost in dollars which you are spending to obtain it. I can assure you that the good education
available here will greatly increase your ability to achieve financial success and security in your
lifetime.</p>
<p>As you include in your education process a determination to gain greater knowledge and
understanding of our Heavenly Father and His plan for us, and as you faithfully follow that plan,
I can promise that you will achieve the <span style="font-weight: bold">ultimate of success and security</span> for all time and
eternity. Unlike monetary rewards that you will eventually leave behind, with the knowledge of
God&#8217;s divine plan which you obtain and observe, you will be able to take the eternal treasures
with you when you graduate from this earthly existence.</p>
<p>Our Savior tells us: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
shall be added unto you </i>(3 Nephi 13: 19-21, 33).</p>
<p>The wonderful bonus of receiving a sure knowledge of our Father in Heaven, is, that it is a gift
given to us. There are many gifts available to us from God. Each will add greatly to our success,
joy and happiness.</p>
<p>Returning to the scriptures we can learn more about the gifts from God:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every

<p>Consider these questions:</p>
<p>What gifts would you like to have?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Would it be to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Would it be to be given knowledge? To be wise in using your education?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Would it be to have the faith to heal?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Would it be to be able to work miracles?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Would it be to speak with tongues? To speak many languages?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Would it be to have all the gifts? To be a leader of men?</p>
<p>The Lord has given each of you talents and gifts! Again I ask the question: 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Are you using them
to nearly 100% of your potential capacity?</span></p>
<p>I believe that most of us <span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> use our gifts and talents anywhere close to our potential. We
probably do not exceed 50% of our capacity. Layne and Shauna have done much better than this.
You, too, can do much better than this. </p>
<p>President Hinckley often commends us for doing our labors well, but, he always adds: 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;but you
can do a little better.&#8221;</span> He knows that we generally do not do our very best; that we function far
below our potential.</p>
<p>Scriptures teach us that we are created in the image of our Father in Heaven; that we have great
talents and gifts. <span style="font-weight: bold">You are indeed a royal generation.</span> I want you to know that you &#8220;students&#8221;
are in that blessed group who are given much, and because of that, much is expected of you.<i>
&#8220;For of him unto whom much is given, much is required&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 82:3)</p>
<p>When I was just a young boy, <span style="font-weight: bold">I loved listening to the &#8220;Children&#8217;s Story Hour&#8221;</span> on the radio. It
was broadcast every Saturday morning and it had wonderful stories to listen to.</p>
<p>If I would get up early in the morning and get my chores done, my mother would let me listen to
the exciting story that would be told. I would sit with my back against the old large console
radio, with my head against the speaker, and thrill with the suspense and adventures coming
from somewhere out there in the world. I worked hard so I could be there every Saturday
morning. I did that for a long time, and heard many wonderful stories, but I must confess I can&#8217;t
today remember most of the stories.</p>
<p>What I can remember though, was the slogan of the company that sponsored the Children&#8217;s
Story Hour program. It was a large greeting card company. It made and sold greeting cards of all
kinds. The cards that congratulate us, cards that give comfort to us, cards that encourage us to get
well from our illness, birthday cards, wedding cards, and many other cards for every purpose.
That company&#8217;s slogan has remained with me all these many years, and has been a guiding
factor in my life.</p>
<p>That slogan was: <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;When you care enough to send the very best, you send Hallmark!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>As the years have passed, my thoughts have turned more to the Lord, and His concern for His
children here on earth. I have realized that His love for us and his concern for our eternal destiny
was so great that He sent <span style="font-weight: bold">His very best</span> to guide us through this turbulent wicked world of
confusion, deception, violence, and evil temptations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">He sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ</span> to teach us, to guide us, to be an example for us, to
atone for us, to heal us, and bring us home.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Our Father in Heaven has sent us here upon the earth to fulfill a similar 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">mission!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">We are to use the gifts He has given us to prepare and perfect ourselves in righteousness</span>, so
that we can know and follow the straight and narrow path that will lead us safely home to our
Father in Heaven. <span style="font-weight: bold">He also expects us to be an example and to assist others along the way. 
		</span></p>
<p>The apostle Paul said: <i>&#8220;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things&#8221;</i> (1 Corinthians 13:11).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">This is where you are right now.</span> You are mature young men and women. The Lord expects
great things from you. <span style="font-weight: bold">You are now &#8220;Deciding Your Destiny!&#8221;</span> This isn&#8217;t going to be an easy
journey for you, but I want you to know that you are among the blessed, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">capable of
becoming the very best of God&#8217;s children.</span> You are here at this time, blessed with the gifts and
talents necessary to overcome the temptations and challenges of this day. This world, in which
we live today, will take great faith and commitment to defeat the evil forces that will work
against you. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">This is a scary world!</span> Violence and wickedness is over all the earth. It is not just in Iraq, or the
Middle East, or Lebanon. It is right here amongst us in the Land of Liberty. We hear of it on the
radio every day. We read it each day in the newspaper and see it on the television as it is
happening. <span style="font-weight: bold">The laws of God are being trampled upon</span> by celebrities, by government leaders,
by self proclaimed prophets, even by the judges of the land; who mock the righteous, and seek to
have the teachings of the Lord banned from all public places. Our constitution guarantees us the
freedom of speech, but our communication with our Father in Heaven is being limited, and
prohibited in many places and venues.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">This should not come as a surprise to us!</span> The Lord has warned us of this day through the
prophets of old. <span style="font-weight: bold">We are now being warned with increasing frequency by our living prophets</span>
that the world in which we live is as wicked as it was in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when
the Lord destroyed them. We are also warned <span style="font-weight: bold">that &#8220;it will not get better.&#8221; 
		</span></p>
<p>The Lord has said to us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your
lives.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">treasure up wisdom</span> in
your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their
wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than
that which shall shake the earth; <span style="font-weight: bold">but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear</span>
</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 38:28-30; emphasis added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, come unto Christ and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his

</i>(Moroni 10:32-33; emphasis added).</p>
<p>I testify to you, and I want you to <span style="font-weight: bold">learn</span> and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">know</span> that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1. You are a royal generation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2. The gifts of God can be yours.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">5. 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">You Decide your Destiny!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">I give you the words of our Savior as my concluding thought:</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, having on the
breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the
gospel of peace, which I have sent mine angels to commit unto you;</i></p>

</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I am grateful for the opportunity to participate with you in this devotional
assembly.  During my years as a student at this institution and the last thirteen years as a faculty
member, I have gained much from the Holy Ghost and those who have articulated great truth and
doctrine from this podium.  While I do not presume to count myself among those who have
presented such inspiring messages, I hope that the spirit and testifier of truth will be present.  I
pray for that same spirit to touch each of us with thoughts and feelings beyond the words; that
we may renew our commitment to be shining examples of goodness and praise.</p>
<p>I speak to you today with the confidence we represent a body of youth spoken of by President J.
Rueben Clark, Jr. who said: <i>&#8220;You do not have to sneak up behind these spiritually experienced
youth and whisper religion in their ears; &#8230;. There is no need for gradual approaches, for
&#8216;bedtime&#8217; stories, for codling, for patronizing&#8230;.  You can bring truths to them openly, in their
natural guise.&#8221;</i>  With this in mind, I am prepared to speak with you plainly in hopes the spirit
will communicate clearly.</p>
<p>I preface my remarks by confessing my own weakness in accomplishing all I wish.  Some of you
who know, or have worked with me, will undoubtedly question the wisdom of the selection for
today&#8217;s devotional speaker.  Some of you who do not yet know me may have the same question
at the end of the meeting.  Please have understanding hearts.  Were there is fault in my own past
behavior, I pray for your forgiveness and ask you to glean what you can from the experience of
someone who struggles daily to qualify for heaven&#39;s blessings in doing what I can to make the
world a better place.</p>
<p>Before we get to what I feel is the heart of the message today, I pay tribute to the Prophet Joseph
Smith.  As many others have already noted, we shall soon celebrate the 200th anniversary of his
birth.  I honor his life, his work and the wonder of his eternal stature.  Have you ever paused to
consider the blessings available to you personally and to all collectively because of the life of
this one individual?  I add my voice to that of William W. Phelps:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Kings shall extol him and nations revere.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven!</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Millions shall know &#8220;Brother Joseph&#8221; again</i> (Hymn 27).</p>
<p>I also praise the Lord, Jesus Christ and express my gratitude for his support and implementation
of the plan of our salvation.  As we read in the History of the Church, one of the many things we
learn from the Prophet Joseph Smith is that <i>&#8220;the fundamental principles of our religion are the
testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and
rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our
religion are only appendages to it</i>&#8221; (Our Heritage).</p>
<p>Today, I wish to address an appendage, realizing the ultimate goal is a testimony and witness of
Christ.  The appendage of which I speak may be one of the most individually overlooked, yet
essential components of our growing testimony.  I emphasize the word individually because as a
church and religion, it appears we do very well while individually we may need some work.</p>
<p>In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read what is regarded as the Lord&#8217;s own
preface to this great collection.  In verses thirty and thirty-one we read: <i>&#8220;&#8230;I, the Lord, am well
pleased, speaking of the church collectively and not individually &#8211; for I the Lord cannot look
upon sin with the least degree of allowance&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 1:30-31).  
		</p>
<p>What is the sin the Lord is speaking of in verse 31?  Rightly, we should agree that it is all sin the 
		<i>&#8220;Lord cannot look upon &#8230; with the least degree of allowance.&#8221;</i>  I am confident this is exactly
what is being implied in this scripture.  Something more specific, however, may be at stake as
we read the entire verse.  I read again Doctrine and Covenants 1:30:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to
lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of
darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with
which I am well-pleased, speaking of the church collectively and not individually</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 1:30).</p>
<p>Could part of the sin be not doing enough as individuals who have received these
commandments to raise the Church out of obscurity?  Or, maybe, while we are cheering the
work of the Church along, we are neglecting our own individual rise out of darkness.  Perhaps
we fall short of the power to which the Lord refers.</p>
<p>Again, I join the throng in paying tribute to Joseph Smith and those other brethren called to lay
the foundations of this work.  I am thrilled when I see evidence of the Church&#8217;s work and
growth.  Tears of joy flow freely when I consider the good accomplished by the Church
throughout the land.  I have worried, however, that my own pace and standards are not be
keeping up with the Church's brightness and luster as she begins to roll through the earth.  In this
light, and in my own observation and experience, my aim is to allow each of us the opportunity
to assess our own standard and discover where we might do better.</p>
<p>Many who profess true Christianity can recite John 3:5 from memory and have a good idea
concerning its meaning. We read; <i>&#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&#8221;</i> (John 3:5).  At face value, we know
the focus of this concept is accepting Christ, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost.  Being born
of the Spirit, however, may include more individual commitment and faith in the Savior than we
had previously thought.</p>
<p>As part of the great plan of salvation, we accepted the opportunity to be born of a man and
woman; becoming their sons and daughters; to receive a physical body; and learn, from our own
physical experience, the difference between choosing good or evil.  Salvation continues as we
choose a second birth.  This time, we must choose to be born of God &#8211; first by water, then by
fire, which is the Spirit.  In this case, entering the waters of baptism represents a sign of our
earthly or physical obedience to become sons and daughters of God.  The fire represents the
resulting transformation of body and spirit necessary to enter his presence.</p>
<p>After being struck dumb and later regaining strength through the fasting and prayers of his
people, Alma the Younger told the people in Mosiah 27:24-26:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am
born of the Spirit.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all
nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God,
changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being
redeemed of God, become his sons and daughters;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise
inherit the kingdom of God</i>.</p>
<p>Perhaps recalling this experience years later, Alma the Younger asked this question in Alma
5:14: <i>&#8220;And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of
God?  Have ye received his image in your countenances?  Have ye experienced this mighty
change in your hearts?&#8221;</i>  I find it interesting that in this case, Alma was not speaking to
unbelievers.  These people had already entered the waters of baptism.  He was speaking to those
who had made a physical commitment to show obedience but perhaps had not yet allowed the
power of Christ to change their spirit and create a &#8216;new creature.&#8217;</p>
<p>This great change of heart and nature requires the combination of individual commitment and
heavenly power.  In one of many revelations on the topic to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord
says in Doctrine and Covenants 11:28-30:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  I am the life and the light of the
world.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I am the same who came unto mine own and mine own received me not;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them will I give
power to become the sons</i> [and I add daughters] <i>of God even to them that believe
on my name.</i></p>
<p>While it is difficult to comprehend, consider for a moment the power the Lord gives to us to
become his sons and daughters.  In an effort to gain success in the eyes of the world, we may be
confusing principles as we define the term power.  If you have a piece of paper and pen or pencil
close by, draw a vertical line down the middle of the paper creating two columns.  Write the
words &#8216;Worldly Power&#8217; at the top of one column and the words &#8216;Heavenly Power&#8217; at the top of
the other.  Take a moment to write the appropriate descriptors that come to your mind under each
column heading.</p>
<p>How do you define worldly power and how do you define heavenly power?  Are they the same? 
Consider the statement previously mentioned: <i>&#8220;to them will I give power to become the sons</i>
[and daughters]<i> of God.&#8221;  </i>This is heavenly power.  We will come back to that column in a few
moments.</p>
<p>As you think of things in the column of worldly power, does your list include descriptors of
control over others, things that will prove you are better than others, and/or number of people to
which you are in charge?  Please keep writing while I describe a few more indicators of worldly
power.  Remember, the impressions that come to you are more important than the words I say.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that our striving for worldly power often views others in a negative way. 
Worldly power often enslaves many for the benefit of a few.  One need look no further than
many of today&#8217;s get-rich-quick schemes to find power seekers striving to use others for personal
gain.  In Doctrine and Covenants 89:4 the Lord even makes mention of <i>&#8220;the evils and designs
which do and will exist  in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Sometimes we mistakenly measure power by the number of people we have working for or
under us rather than how we are helping those whom we have been called to serve.  Sadly, it is
becoming more common to hear individuals tout their leadership opportunities in terms better
left to worldly power.  They often note their accomplishments by citing the number of people
they are in charge of rather than how outcomes are creating a meaningful experience and more
enriched lives for those involved.  Even more dangerous, those who seek glory for controlling
others pursue a course opposite that of the plan of salvation and the direction the Savior would
have a follow.</p>
<p>The list we create for describing worldly power might include: control, force, subversion etc. 
Whatever the case, this list is likely to be opposite the list one would include for heavenly or
God-given power.  Consider Doctrine and Covenants 121:39-46.  While we will not take time to
read the entire passage, a brief overview may prove helpful in understanding what is required for
heavenly power.  Verse 39 begins, <i>&#8220;We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and
disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will
immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.&#8221;</i>  As we read on in versus 41-46 we find
the antidote to such illness and a list for what might be considered the requirements for, or
manifestation of, heavenly power.  Following these scriptures, our list might include: persuasion,
long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love, kindness, pure knowledge, without hypocrisy,
without guile, charitable, faithful, virtuous, and confidence in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>In many aspects, heavenly power is the opposite of worldly power.  Instead of being in control of
others, heavenly power suggests we control ourselves, submitting our will to the will of the
Savior, and receiving Him.  In turn, we receive power to become like Him.  While heavenly
power comes from heaven, there are many things we must to do invite this transformation into
our lives.  Allow me to suggest five elements, which applied in our lives, will help us qualify for
this redeeming power.  In fact, I will use the letters in the word power as an acronym.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;P&#8221;</span> is for praise.  A person manifesting the conversion of heavenly power working in them will
be full of praise.  To praise means to show and do our very best for the Lord and others.  As a
church, we collectively seek things that are praiseworthy.  As individuals, however, we may not
be so anxiously engaged.  As an example, our temples and other church buildings are built of the
finest materials and craftsmanship yet some individuals choose to ignore the beauty through
carelessness and neglect.  In a recent interview with Larry King in the Conference Center in Salt
Lake City, President Gordon B. Hinckley was asked about the beauty and expense of that
magnificent building.  President Hinckley&#8217;s reply was short and instructive: &#8220;<i>nothing is too good
for the Lord.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Praise could be referred to as the beautifying action of thankful heart.  Gratitude is the primary
ingredient of praise but it is not full praise unless we express that gratitude in word and deed. 
One of the beautiful hymns we often sing is sometimes mistaken for a simple song about the
earth.  The stirring words in Hymn 92 by Folliot S. Pierpoint, reflect an action of praise
qualifying us for heavenly power.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This our hymn of grateful praise.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For the beauty of each hour</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This our hymn of grateful praise.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This our hymn of grateful praise.</i></p>
<p>Imagine for just a moment that each of us actually lived our lives in accordance with the words
of this hymn.  Not just feeling grateful but showing our gratitude for beauty and joy.  There
would be no need for honor codes.  There would be no need for civil laws governing how we
treat others and the earth.  We would show our gratitude by our actions.  We would gratefully
take care of all that which the Lord has blessed us: the earth would be more beautiful, each hour
would be treasured, the joy of family and friends would be promoted, and our thoughts would be
gentle and mild.  It is one thing to think it.  It is praise to do it.</p>
<p>In addition, praise is much more than a hopeful sentiment; it is a requirement for spiritual
change.  Indeed, it is one of the few acceptable offerings we have to give to the Lord.  In
Hebrews 13:15-16, Paul taught:<i> &#8220;By him </i>[meaning the Lord] <i>therefore let us offer the sacrifice
of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  But to do
good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>While gratitude and doing good are essential ingredients of praise, we must understand that true
praise means to do our best or, as President Hinckley has stated, &#8220;do [our] very best.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an important component of praise, we should seek opportunities to create beauty.  We should
consider our actions in regards to the effect they will have on the lives of others.  In turn, our
own experience will be enriched and blessed with heavenly power.  Too often, we feel people
should accept us for who we are rather than encourage us for who we are becoming.  Years ago,
I was challenged by a student whom I had confronted with a campus dress code violation.  I was
saddened by their lack of understanding and defiance.  At one point in the conversation, the
student chastised me for seemingly judging them inappropriately.  It was felt I should practice
more Christ-like character and look beyond the outward appearance to the heart and intent of the
person.  While I am certain I am not qualified to look upon the intent or heart as Christ would, I
was struck with the following impressions:  Why would you want to dress or disguise yourself in
a manner that is different from the true intent of your heart?  Why should others need to guess at
what you are trying to become?  Wanting to get to know you, others should not be confused or
distracted by what you outwardly communicate.  To praise is to do and show our very best.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;O&#8221;</span> is for obedience and oblations.  To be born again, we must be obedient to God&#8217;s will and
offer our oblations.  Our oblation is to receive and partake of the sacrament and its blessings. 
Each Sabbath day, we have the right and responsibility to prepare ourselves to receive and
partake of the sacrament of Christ.  I am intrigued by the definitions of the word partake. 
Consider the following definition as it applies to the Sacrament: To partake is &#8220;to have part of
the quality, nature, or character of something.&#8221;  In this case, the &#8220;something&#8221; is someone &#8211;
Christ.  The next time you receive the sacrament; take time to think, &#8220;Am I willing to share in
the quality, nature and character of Christ, the Redeemer?&#8221;  As we partake of this holy ordinance
week by week, month by month and year by year, we are not only having part, we are becoming
that quality, nature, and character.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;W&#8221;</span> is for wisdom.  We are commanded to learn wisdom in our youth and yet wisdom seems to
be reserved for the aged.  If wisdom is the ability to act and make decisions based on complete
knowledge of truth, how can we then gain the wisdom required?  Let us briefly follow the path
of Joseph Smith as he read James 1:5: <i>&#8220;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giventh to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&#8221;</i>  For many years in
my life, I unconsciously and erroneously changed a word in this verse creating frustration in
some of my decisions.  In my mind, I had changed the words to read:  &#8220;If any of you lack
[information, bicycles, good grades, etc.], let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally.&#8221;  I
could not understand why God would say all men liberally, and not mean me when all I wanted
was information, bicycles and good grades.  Obviously, the word I did not understand was
&#8216;wisdom.&#8217;  &#8220;If any of you lack wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>God gives wisdom liberally to all who ask in faith.  Once I discovered my error, my next step
was to understand that gaining wisdom is not always pleasant nor what we think we want. 
Joseph Smith&#8217;s own experience with gaining wisdom was a trial of faith and energy.  In Joseph
Smith History we read:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having
looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer
up the desires of my heart to God.  I had scarcely done so, when immediately I
was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me . . . as to bind my
tongue so that I could not speak.  Thick darkness gathered around me, and it
seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction</i> (JS History
1:15).</p>
<p>As we read on, we find this was not an imaginary experience for the young boy but something of
great physical and spiritual terror.  The next part of the passage, however, is helpful to
understand how wisdom is gained:  <i>&#8220;But exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me
		</i>[I am skipping a few lines],<i> I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of
the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.  It no sooner appeared than I found
myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound&#8221; </i>(JS History 1:16-17).</p>
<p>Wisdom is often gained by exerting all our powers to call upon God.  In reality, Our Heavenly
Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are the only ones who know all things.  We gain wisdom
by learning to rely upon them for deliverance, not only in our time of desperate need but by
exerting all our power to call upon them in times of comfort.  And then remember, the light
descends gradually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;E&#8221;</span> is for enduring to the end.  While true wisdom is a gift from heaven, its development is
honed by our demonstration of patience and holding firm to fundamental and immovable
principles.  Consider again the counsel of James: <i>&#8220;But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. 
For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed&#8221;</i> (James 1:6). 
Life-long endurance is necessary to receiving the life-changing power of the Lord.</p>
<p>The final letter of our acronym of &#8216;power&#8217; is 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;R&#8221;</span> &#8211; to remember.  History is only dead to us
when we do not take the time to understand how it molds our lives and helps us progress.  The
wise understand that we are interdependently connected to history.  We grow from its mistakes,
we triumph from its successes, and we live on because it went before.  As we learned so vividly
from the dark ages of the apostasy: when history is dead, we are damned.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was approached by a group of students seeking help on a project concerning a
vision for a certain aspect of the future in the arts.  After speaking with them, I suggested the
best way to see the future is to spend some time with the past.  To my surprise, this suggestion
seemed to disappoint and frustrate their enthusiasm.  They seemed bent on the idea that the only
way to come up with something new was to proceed unencumbered by thoughts and discoveries
of the past.  Ironically, the very course they were pursuing had already been attempted
unsuccessfully.  Because of their refusal to know and remember the past, they were destined to
repeat the mistake.  To learn is to live; to learn from the past is to live better.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;remember&#8221; occurs more than 550 times in the standard works of the Church.  To
remember implies rejoining with some one or thing that he or she once knew.  As spirits in the
presence of Heavenly Father, we were in the presence of all knowledge.  Because of this
knowledge, we recognized our own need for experience.  We made the choice to come to earth
and be born of a man and a woman.  Separated from God's presence, we must now choose to
remember: remember our Savior, remember our covenants, remember what the Lord has told us
in the past, and remember what the Spirit prompts us to do today.</p>
<p>Sadly, too many of us feel we must discover the difference between good and evil all by
ourselves.  This re-inventing-the-wheel attitude contradicts the very laws of progression.  We
may erroneously feel that for anything to be good or important, we must discover it ourselves or
simply wait until we are told what to do.  Revelation is a reality to the restored Gospel and
moves the work along but we may need a reminder of how the Lord communicates with his
children.</p>
<p>While preparing to enter full-time missionary service, I had the same opportunity many of you
have had in sitting in counsel with priesthood leaders.  On the evening of the required interview
with my Stake President, I was asked a puzzling question.  Before I continue I want you to know,
my Stake President was (and still is) a man of great love, wisdom and whit.  As I sat across the
desk, he asked if I had prayed for the assurance that I should serve a mission.  Dutifully, I replied
in the affirmative.  Then he leaned over his desk toward me with one eyebrow slightly cocked
and asked, &#8220;did you get an answer?&#8221;  Frankly, I was taken aback by the question.  From my
earliest memories and thoughts, I had been taught I was going on a mission.  The truth of the
matter is, I had never considered not serving a mission.  I believe I had prayed for an assurance
but could not honestly respond that I had received any answer.  His question burned inside of
me: &#8220;did you get an answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>It must have been some time, and he seemed to enjoy my discomfort before he finally came to
my rescue in teaching me a valuable lesson in the way the Lord communicates with His children
and why education is vital.  He reminded me the Lord loved me enough to provide an answer
long before I had even thought of the question to ask.  My years of upbringing, opportunities of
church service, and completing all other necessary work had prepared me for missionary service. 
While it was very little, if any, of my own doing, I could easily look back and remember how the
Lord had prepared me for the task he wanted me to accomplish.  In addition, the Lord had
spoken through his prophet several years earlier.  Over the pulpit in General Conference,
President Spencer W. Kimball declared that every worthy young man should serve a full-time
mission.  Again, the Lord had mercifully answered my question before I had even thought what
to ask.</p>
<p>Too often, we forget the eternal nature of our Heavenly Father.  Perhaps because we cannot
comprehend it well, we struggle to understand how he can answer our prayers before we think of
the questions.  I amuse myself every time I consider what the people in the Book of Mormon
thought as they read what the prophet of their day had written about them.  In reality, they
probably did not have the opportunity to read it real-time.  Certainly, they heard the word from
the mouths of the prophets but records compiled are for us.</p>
<p>Some of us may fail to understand the scriptures because we read it as a book of the past rather
than a guide for the future and a way to remember.  Mormon was commanded by the Lord to
include things in the record for our benefit.  It is full of answers to our questions, our prayers,
and our time.  It is a testimony that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.</p>
<p>To remember in the future, we must learn much now.  The Lord tells us much today in hopes we
will remember it in the future when we need it most.  We are admonished to seek learning from
the best books and those who have been prepared to teach and expound.  Consider this statement
by Elder Dallin H. Oaks:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There have been inspired men and women in every discipline.  The Lord expects
us to learn what we can from what he has previously revealed.  We do not begin
by rejecting what we sometimes call &#8216;the learning of men.&#8217;  The learning of men,
when it is true, is inspired of God.  We must put our own efforts into paying the
price of learning, of degrees, and of all intermediate steps necessary to acquire
depth in our individual disciplines and skills.   Future revelation in a particular
discipline or skill is most likely to come to one who has paid the price of learning
all that has previously been revealed</i> (Dallin H. Oaks, Educating Zion, p.126).</p>
<p>Perhaps too many of us feel we will be blessed with heavenly power without putting forth the
effort to learn and grow.  While at BYU-Idaho we should develop habits of gaining knowledge
now and building solid memories that will be of help to us in the future.  For better or for worse,
those memories will be brought back to our remembrance in the future.  We should seek out
those prepared to teach.  We should learn from the best books.  We should turn to the Lord for
wisdom.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the beginning the heaven power necessary for change can be initiated as we
develop these five attributes: praise, obedience and oblation, wisdom, endurance, and
remembrance.  Understanding these concepts more clearly will help us prepare ourselves for the
atonement of Christ and for the spiritual birth necessary to enter the kingdom of God.  And, like
Alma, receive a change of heart and countenance that we might individually join the church
collectively rising out of darkness and obscurity.</p>
<p>Though I am weak and often fall short of the worthiness required, it is my testimony that the
redemption of all is only through faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ.  We must follow Him to be truly
born again.  Knowing the troubled times in which we would live, he has chosen apostles and
prophets to guide us.  Knowing the will of our Heavenly Father is revealed through obedience to
principles and ordinances of the Church is a great blessing.  It is my prayer that we come to
know Christ more fully and put into practice those ideals that transform us into sons and
daughters of God; in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Good afternoon. I am very pleased and excited to be here today. This school is a major part of
my life. Years ago, my wife, LeAnn, then a new convert to the church from Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, came to what was Ricks College to attend school. She had only been a member of the
church for a few months and it was at this school that she formed her first knowledge and
testimony of the Gospel. She can still recall those professors who made indelible impressions on
her. While she was a student, she served as Vice President of Activities and was involved in the
program bureau as a baton twirler. Now, LeAnn and I are the parents of 5 boys and 1 girl. While
our daughter is leaving in a month for a mission to Switzerland, each of our five sons has already
served and is now married. And guess what. All five of their wives are graduates from this
school. So, even though I went to BYU-Provo as an undergraduate, every time we get together as
a family, all the girls in our family talk about their fond memories in Rexburg. And, to top that
off, our son was a quarterback on what was the Ricks College Football team about 10 years ago.
You see, our family just can&#8217;t get enough of this outstanding school.</p>
<p>As was noted in my introduction, I have now been teaching for over 30 years at three major
universities. During that period, there have been several hundred instances where young men and
women have come to me seeking advice about careers, job opportunities, graduate school,
marriage and other major decisions. In each case, I have tried to give the best, Gospel-based
counsel I could. For my few minutes today, I&#8217;d like to assume that you are a student who has
come asking for advice. In our own way, I&#8217;d like to think of this presentation today as a one-on-one conversation with you, hopefully providing some practical guidance that will be helpful as
you make major decisions in your lives.</p>
<p>The Bible states that there is a time and season for everything. In Ecclesiastes 3:1-2 it states: &#8220;<i>To
every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven; A time to be born,
and a time to die, a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.&#8221;</i> Right now, most
of you are fully engaged in preparing for your future&#8212;you are in the planting stage of your lives.
This is a very important time of your life. In fact, much of the happiness or sorrow and the
success or failure you will experience throughout your life will be a result of the preparation and
planting you do now and the options and opportunities you create for yourself while you are in
this planting stage. You will reap only what you sow and so your goal should be to plant the best
crops possible and to create as many opportunities as you can for yourself.</p>
<p>I am a great believer that we can have much more success and happiness if we have more
opportunities or choices or more of what I call options. People without options have no freedom.
I personally believe that Heavenly Father wants us to use this planting stage to create as many
and the best options we can for us and our future families.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what an option is for a moment. Webster defines an option as a choice; the
power, right or liberty of choosing; something that is or can be chosen; and the right, acquired
for a consideration, to buy or sell something at a fixed price within a specific time. I&#8217;m sure
you&#8217;ve all heard of stock options or the option to purchase a piece of land. A stock option is the
right to buy a share of stock at a specific price. For example, if you hold the option to buy a
share of stock at $5 and the market price rises to $15, you can buy the stock for $5 and
immediately sell the stock for $15 on the same day, making $10 per share.</p>
<p>We know that one of the reasons Heavenly Father sent us to this earth was to see if we could
make good choices. This life is a testing ground. A pre-requisite to making good choices is
having alternatives from which to choose. In fact, it is the ability to make choices that gives us
freedom. A very important success and happiness strategy in this fast-changing world is to do
everything possible to maximize your options and choices and, hence, freedom.</p>
<p>While we live in a free country and have few, if any, externally or politically imposed
constraints, many of us lose or limit our freedom by the actions we take and by the choices we
make or fail to make. When the future is uncertain, as it is today, it pays to have a broad range of
options available. Option theory rewards flexibility. In fact, your future successes and failures
will largely depend on what options you provide for yourself while in this planting stage of your
life.</p>
<p>Let me give you a simple, but obvious example. Assume that two young women start BYU-Idaho on the same day. During their first three years, one studies harder than the other and earns
a 3.6 cumulative GPA. The other, either explicitly or by default decides that school is a time for
play as well as studying and does not work as hard as her friend. As a result, after 3 years of
college, her cumulative GPA is 2.8. During their junior year, the two young women decide that
they will apply to graduate school. Upon getting the applications, they realize that the minimum
GPA for applying is a 3.0. Unfortunately, only one of the two young women can even apply.
Because of her 2.8 GPA, the second young woman has lost an option.</p>
<p>It is the same with life. In a rapidly-changing world, you should create and keep open as many
options as you can so you will be nimble and can move quickly and take advantage of these
options. As long as you keep your options open, you have more choices and freedom and will be
more successful and happy in the future. There are several things you can do to maximize your
options and keep yourself nimble and ready to act. Today, I would like to talk about eight.
Hopefully, our discussion of these option-granting ideas will constitute practical advice that will
bring you greater happiness in the future.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #1: Do everything you can to build a good reputation.</span></p>
<p>People with tarnished reputations, lose options in life. Sometimes this loss of options occurs at
work and sometimes it happens at home. Let me give you a couple of examples. In the play, &#8220;All
My Sons&#8221; written by Arthur Miller, there is a place where a son sees his father cheating in the
business world. Up until then, his dad has been his hero. When he confronts his dad, his father
says, &#8220;Son, everybody does it. You have to cheat to be successful.&#8221; The son replies, &#8220;I know dad,
but I thought you were better than everyone else.&#8221; This father just lost options with his son. In
another example, I am aware of a woman who worked for a corporation for 37 years. We believe
she was honest for the first 34. During her last three years, she started embezzling and eventually
stole $686,000. When caught, the company took her home, her cars, her retirement account and
most of her other assets. Through seizing all these assets, the company recovered about
$400,000. She lost her reputation for honesty and the respect of her friends and was sentenced to
serve one year in a federal prison. She is now out of prison but must make monthly restitution
payments of $333 per month to the company. If she misses one payment, she violates her parole
and goes back to jail. In other words, she must spend the rest of her life either working or in jail.
She has lost options. And, to make matters worse, since stolen money is taxable in the U.S., the
IRS came after her and told her that she had $686,000 of income she didn&#8217;t report on her tax
return. When she finished negotiating with the IRS, they called the $400,000 she repaid the
company a loan but assessed taxes on the $286,000 she will never repay (at $333 per month,
she&#8217;s not even paying the interest) With fines, penalties and interest, she owes the IRS over
$200,000 and has entered in an agreement to make tax payments to the IRS of $540 every
month. She is a now a convicted felon who works in a fast-food restaurant at close to minimum
wage. She is 70 years old and has no home or other assets. This lady has lost not only her
reputation, but the freedom to live where she wants, work where she wants, buy what she wants,
travel where she wants, and even marry who she wants because her husband divorced her. You
will have many more options in the future if you build a good reputation and name. As it says in
Ecclesiastes 7:1 <i>&#8220;A good name is better than precious ointment.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So how do you gain a good reputation? I believe there are three keys, all of which we learn about
in the temple: (1) have integrity in all we do; in other words, be honest, (2) be a finisher, and (3)
return and report. We have already discussed the role of integrity&#8212;the lady who stole money
lost her reputation because of her dishonesty.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now discuss being a finisher. Throughout our lives, each of us will be given stewardship
assignments. We will be stewards in our jobs, in our homes, in our wards and stakes, as students
and in many other settings. As stewards, we are the ones who have taken on or been given
assignments&#8212;to be a father or mother, to be an employee, to be a Bishop or Relief Society
President, etc. We have been called, selected, applied for or have been given assignments. We
know what is expected and we have made commitments about how we will perform. Our
reputation will largely be determined by how we perform in those responsibilities. I believe we
have two responsibilities: (1) to be a finisher and get the job done (whatever the assignment) and
(2) to return and report. Let me illustrate the finisher concept by using a story that President
Monson tells often. This is a story he first told in 1972 (Ensign, July 1972.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>On sunlit days during the noon hour, the streets of Salt Lake City abound with
men and women who for a moment leave the confines of the tall office buildings
and engage in that universal delight called window shopping. On occasion, I, too,
am a participant. On Wednesday, I paused before the elegant show window of a
prestigious furniture store. That which caught and held my attention was not the
beautifully designed sofa nor the comfortable-appearing chair that stood at its
side. Neither was it the beautiful chandelier positioned overhead. Rather, my eyes
rested upon a small sign that had been placed at the bottom right-hand corner of
the window. Its message was brief: &#8220;Finishers Wanted.&#8221; The store had need of
those persons who possessed the talent and the skill to make ready for the final
sale the expensive furniture that the firm manufactured and sold. Finishers
wanted. The words remained with me as I returned to the pressing activities of the
day. In life, as in business, there has always been a need for those persons who
could be called finishers. Their ranks are few, their opportunities many, their
contributions great.</i></p>
<p>It was Napleon Hill who said: &#8220;There is always room for those who can be relied upon to deliver
the goods when they say they will.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my positions as a dean and stake president, I often make assignments&#8212;assignments to serve
on committees, to fulfill assignments, to complete research, and to teach classes. There are some
people I ask often and others I never ask, especially when I need a job done well. I absolutely
hate it when I get no response or feedback and I have to search to find out what has been done. I
will pay a lot of money for someone who will complete a job; I will pay even more for someone
who will complete the job and return and report.</p>
<p>In most cases, living the Gospel, being a parent or employee and completing stewardship
assignments is not a team sport. It is very different from basketball or baseball. Rather, it is like
wrestling. We are on our own (with limited help from others.) We pray alone. We plan alone.
We often work alone. And, we, alone, decide whether to be a finisher and whether or not to
return and report.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of our lives, a fundamental question remains to be answered by each of
us who runs the race of life. That question is: &#8220;shall I falter or shall I finish.&#8221; On the answer to
that question await the blessings of joy and happiness here in mortality and eternal life in the
world to come. Let&#8217;s look at some examples of finishers and non-finishers from the scriptures.</p>
<p>David was not a finisher. He rode the crest of popularity. He slew the giant. As he achieved fresh
victories, the women greeted him with a new song: <i>&#8220;Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
his ten thousands&#8221; </i>(1 Samuel 18:7). Power he won; peace he lost. It happened one evening when
David was walking upon the roof of the king&#8217;s house that he saw from the roof a woman bathing,
and the woman was very beautiful. <i>&#8220;And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one
said, Is not this Bathsheba,&#8230;the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&#8221; </i>So 
		<i>&#8220;David sent messengers, and
took her&#8221;</i> (2 Samuel 11:3-4). The gross sin of adultery was followed by yet another:<i> &#8220;&#8230;Set ye
Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and
die&#8221; </i>(2 Sam. 11:15). Lust and power had triumphed. David commenced well the race, then
faltered and failed to finish his course.</p>
<p>Another non-finisher was Judas Iscariot. He commenced his ministry as an apostle of the Lord.
He ended it a traitor. For thirty paltry pieces of silver, he sold his soul. At last, realizing the
enormity of his sin, Judas, to the patrons and tempters of his crime, shrieked: 
		<i>&#8220;I have sinned in
that I have betrayed innocent blood&#8221; </i>(Mathew 27:4). He then threw down the pieces of silver
and went and hanged himself.</p>
<p>A finisher was Job. Pious in his conduct, prosperous in his fortune, Job was to face a series of
tests that would tempt any man. Shorn of his possessions, scorned by his friends, afflicted by his
suffering, and even tempted by his wife, Job was to declare from the depths of his noble soul:<i>
&#8220;&#8230;behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high&#8221;</i> (Job 16:19); 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;I know that my
redeemer liveth&#8230;&#8221; </i>(Job 19:25) Job did not falter; he became a finisher.</p>
<p>Paul was also a finisher. Some of his last words were <i>&#8220;I have fought a good fight, I have finished
my course, I have kept the faith&#8221; </i>(2 Timothy 4:7).</p>
<p>And, the greatest finisher of all was Jesus Christ. While the task was almost impossible, he
followed through to the bitter end. He said something to the effect of &#8220;Father, if it be possible let
this cup pass from me. However, not my will, but thy will be done.&#8221; Think how our lives would
be different if Jesus hadn&#8217;t been a finisher.</p>
<p>So, the most important thing you can do is be a finisher. Here&#8217;s a poem about finishers&#8212;the
author is unknown:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in">i.Stick to your task, til it sticks to you;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in">ii.Beginners are many, but enders are few.</p>

		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in">vii.For out of the bend and the sweat and the smile</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in">viii.Will come life&#8217;s victories after a while.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Author Unknown</p>
<p>Another important element in building a good reputation is to learn to return and report.
Remember, no assignment is complete until you have reported. Think how great it would be if
you could teach your children to report back. I have tried hard as a parent to teach my children
that the last step in any assignment is to report back. If I have them deliver something, they
report back. If I assign them to mow the lawn, they must report back. Learning to report back is a
great skill that is highly valued in the business world. If there is one thing you learn today, please
commit that whatever you are asked to do, you report back to the person who issued the
assignment. As home and visiting teachers, you should not only visit but report back. Your
leaders shouldn&#8217;t have to call you to see if you&#8217;ve completed your assignment. The temple
provides a great example of the power and necessity of reporting back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you have heard the phrase, &#8220;if you want something done, give it to the busiest person
you know.&#8221; Nothing could be truer and the reputation that busy person has earned him- or
herself will create tremendous options for him or her during his or her life.</p>
<p>So the first option-granting strategy is to do everything possible to earn and keep a good
reputation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #2: Get as Much Education and Learning as You Can</span></p>
<p>A second option- and freedom-maximizing strategy is to get as much education and learning as
possible. You must become life-long learners if you are going to succeed in the future. With the
fast-paced changes we are experiencing, the content knowledge you acquire in college probably
won&#8217;t be relevant very long. You must get as much education and learning as you can throughout
your life. Consider the following quote by Brigham Young: <i>&#8220;We might ask, when shall we cease
to learn? I will give you my opinion about it; never, never......We shall never cease to learn,
unless we apostatize from the religion of Jesus Christ&#8221;</i> (Brigham Young, JD 3:203).</p>
<p>Personally, I am a Certified Public Accountant or CPA. When I graduated from BYU with a
bachelors degree and sat for the CPA Examination in 1971, there were only 15 professional
standards that I had to learn to prepare for the exam. Today, most of these standards have been
superseded and aren&#8217;t relevant anymore. In addition, we now have almost that many new
standards being issued every year. The accounting profession, like all other professions, has had
to change and become more dynamic to keep up with faced-paced changes in business and the
world. If I had to rely on what I learned at BYU to practice as a CPA today, I would be sued for
malpractice. Indeed, the purpose of college is not to learn facts, but to learn how to learn.</p>
<p>The first presidency recognized the value of education in creating options. In the For the
Strength of Youth pamphlet, the first presidency state: <i>&#8220;Education will help you to better
provide for yourself, your loved ones, and those in need&#8230;You live in a competitive world where
a good education opens the doors of opportunity </i>(another way to say creates options) 
		<i>that may
otherwise be closed to you.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>To help you understand the value of an education in monetary terms, consider the following
census statistics from the year 2003:</p>
<p>Unemployment Rate</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #3: Maintain Good Health</span></p>
<p>The third option-maximizing strategy is to maintain good health. When you lose your health or
you become addicted to harmful substances or habits, you lose freedom. Personally, I am not
quite as fit as I would like to be. I exercise regularly but have trouble watching what I eat. As a
result, I have lost some options that others have. I remember one day riding motorcycles with my
boys on the Boulder Mountain in Southern Utah. We were riding up a very rough and steep trail.
Because they were all young and physically fit, all four of my older boys cruised right to the top
on their motorcycles. I tried to follow them and tipped over. I tried again and tipped over a
second time. After the third attempt and crash, I laid the bike down, hiked to the top and told my
sons to go back down and bring my bike up for me. Because I wasn&#8217;t as physically fit as them, I
had lost an option. Section 89 contains a promise about these health options if we live according
to the Word of Wisdom:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings (meaning maintaining
good health and following the word of wisdom), walking in obedience to the
commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint (In other words, you
will have more options) (Doctrine Covenants 89:18-20). </p>
<p>I recently listened to a very successful, retired corporate executive talk about lessons he had
learned in his life. He said that he believed the four most important things we can do are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">1. Take care of our health</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">2. Take care of our family</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">3. Surround ourselves with good people</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">4. Don&#8217;t take ourselves too seriously</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #4: Preserve Your Financial Freedom</span></p>
<p>A fourth way to maximize your options is to preserve your financial freedom. We now live in a
world where everyone borrows&#8211;in fact, in the U.S., for every net saver, there are approximately
19 net borrowers. After graduating (and probably even now), almost every day in the mail, you
will get solicitations from finance and other companies wanting to extend credit to you. They
will use glowing terms and phrases about giving you financial freedom but what they really want
is for you to enter into financial bondage to them. When you take upon yourself debt, you lose
freedom and options and the ability to act quickly and independently because someone else tells
you how to spend your money. If you are burdened with too much debt, you may not be able to
change jobs, move, make an investment you should, or even to serve when called upon by the
church. Debt is probably okay for your education, buying a home, buying a first car for work, or
making investments in such things as real estate. But, debt is not okay for most other things.
Let&#8217;s consider even school debt for a minute. When you get loans, you don&#8217;t pay taxes on them.
So, when you pay them back, you don&#8217;t get a tax deduction. This means that if you make
$50,000 per year after you graduate, you will be taxed on the full amount you make but will have
far less cash because you will be repaying non-deductible loans. As a result, you should try to
minimize the amount of school debt you must use and work wherever possible.</p>
<p>Credit card debts are even worse than school loans. They carry higher interest rates and using
them to spend money defers the agony of having debt. They almost give you the feeling that you
can have something for nothing. Let me give you an example of the perils of credit card debt.
Let&#8217;s assume you have a credit card balance of $2,400 and an interest rate of 19.8% If you pay
the minimum suggested monthly payment of $48 (65% of all people pay the minimum payment),
it would take 43.6 years to pay the debt off. If you skip December/Christmas payment (an
allowable gift from Master Card), it will take you 85.2 years to pay the debt off. My counsel to
you is to avoid credit card debt wherever possible and if you do have credit card debt pay it off
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to be happy and successful in the future, work hard to maintain your financial
freedom. There is something very comforting&#8212;even spiritual&#8212;about living well within your
means. Many scriptures warn us that debt takes away our freedom. Consider Proverbs 22:7 for
example, <i>&#8220;the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #5: Stay Free from Guilt and Live so the Spirit is Your
Constant Companion</span></p>
<p>A fifth option-maximizing strategy is staying free from guilt, maintaining a clear conscience and
living your life so the Spirit is your constant companion. It is impossible to feel guilty and be
happy. I remember a number of years ago, one of our children was shooting his bow and arrow
in the back yard. As parents, we had told him several times not to get his bow and arrow out
unless we were in the mountains, especially when we were not at home. He had some friends and
a younger brother with him and they started messing around. He got his fancy new bow out. He
thought he was aiming at the target, but instead, he shot the arrow over our fence, across the road
and right through our neighbor&#8217;s new garage door. This happened early in the day. He asked his
friends and brother not to say anything about what happened. He lived with the guilt until about
10:00 p.m. that night when he could no longer stand it. Finally, he came into our bedroom crying
and admitted what he had done. I immediately got out of bed and got dressed and, hand-in-hand,
we went to the neighbor&#8217;s home and he told him what he had done and we offered to pay for a
new garage door, which we did. While our son still felt badly about doing something he was told
not to do, he was a lot happier facing the consequences of his actions because he didn&#8217;t have to
harbor that guilt and know that until he told his parents and the neighbor, inside himself, he was
a liar with a guilty conscience and he had even made his younger brother and friends be
dishonest too. I personally don&#8217;t believe you can ever reach your potential, have freedom of
peace of mind, or be happy if you are harboring guilt. The scriptures make it clear that we cannot
live in sin and be happy.</p>
<p>A person I highly respect once stated that for someone to be happy, they must have the following
three things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">1. A clear conscience</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">2. Someone to love</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4375in; margin-right: 0.4375in">3. Work to do</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about having the Spirit as your constant companion. How many of you are returned
missionaries? How many of you loved your missions? How many of you thought your missions
were hard? Isn&#8217;t it amazing that we all loved our missions but they were hard and, as a matter of
fact, we were doing things like going door to door that we wouldn&#8217;t want to do the rest of our
lives? I believe there is a reason we all loved our mission and I don&#8217;t believe many missionaries
understand why. I believe that for 2 years or 18 months or however long we served, we had the
Spirit with us on a daily basis. And, I believe two things happen when we have the Spirit in our
lives. First, we are happy. I don&#8217;t believe it is possible to have the Spirit in our lives and be
unhappy. And, second, when we have the Spirit in our lives, we don&#8217;t think of ourselves but we
think of others. Now, do you think you will have more options if you are a happy person or a sad
person? Do you think you will have more options if you are a selfish person, always thinking of
yourself, or a selfless person, always thinking of others? When we were missionaries the others
that we thought of instead of ourselves were our investigators and the people we served. But,
after our missions, who is it? I would say it is our coworkers, our spouses and our families? Let&#8217;s
assume for a moment that you are married. Don&#8217;t you think it would be great for your marriage if
(1) you always put someone else (your spouse) first and (2) you were happy? So, if having the
Spirit in your life gives you options, how do you get it and keep it? The scriptures tell us that to
have the Spirit, we must have a soft heart (Helaman 6:34). So, how do we get and keep a soft
heart? Certainly, missionaries have figured out how to do it, so let&#8217;s think for a minute together
about what missionaries do. Do missionaries ever pray? How many times a day? Our lives must
be full of prayer. Do missionaries ever read their scriptures? Do missionaries ever serve other
people? You see, praying, reading scriptures, serving others, going to church, attending the
temple and other similar things soften our hearts which allow us to get the Spirit which makes us
happier and which leads to having more happiness and options in life. As a stake president, when
I counsel young people who are getting married, I tell them to look for opportunities to serve, to
pray, read their scriptures, and to become engaged in other heart-softening activities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #6: Marry Someone who will Make You Better</span></p>
<p>The sixth option maximizing strategy I want to discuss with you today is marrying someone who
will be a support to you and who will make you better. A farmer friend of mine always tells his
children to marry up so they improve the gene pool. The truth is, it is tough to go through life
and make progress when you have a spouse who is holding you down or causing problems.
Marrying a project, say someone with an addiction, is usually not wise and only leads to lost
options in the future. I know a woman who was divorced and remarried three or four years ago.
Her new husband, who is also divorced, has a great job, but they have to pay $2,500 per month
in child support and alimony&#8212;a huge drain on their monthly income. Their divorces have caused
them to lose the option of spending the $2,500 per month how they want to. You&#8217;ve heard the
saying that &#8220;behind every good man is a better wife&#8221; and the converse is also probably true.
Marrying someone who lives by the spirit, has a strong testimony and who will work together
with you will bring you more options in your life. As you think about who to marry, the most
important thing is to look for someone of faith. Too many of you look mostly at how physically
attractive someone is when choosing a mate. That is the wrong criterion. I can guarantee you that
physical attraction is very temporary and that, especially that man that you women are looking
for, won&#8217;t be nearly as attractive when he is 50 or 60. Rather, he will be bald, overweight or look
different in some other dramatic way. Since finding someone of faith is the most important
criterion, how do you know if one is a person of faith? I believe there are three way. You look at
(1) what they do, (2) what they say and (3) what they wear and how they look. If you just
analyze those three things carefully, you can tell whether someone is a serious person of faith.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #7: Build a Big Network of Friends</span></p>
<p>The seventh option maximizing strategy is to build as big a network of friends as you can. There
are two ways to get ahead in life: (1) by earning what you get and (2) by knowing people who
can help you. Only about 5-10% of all new jobs are posted in classified ads or on the Internet.
The rest are filled by people who know someone. In the business world, a referral is much more
productive than cold calls whether one is selling goods or services, creating business
opportunities, or trying to get someone hired. An example of the value of networking is my own
two children who are still undergraduate students at BYU. Both have their current part-time jobs
because they knew the person who was hiring, not because they were the most qualified for the
job.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Option producing strategy #8: Think Big&#8212;You Are a Son or Daughter of God</span></p>
<p>The last option granting strategy we&#8217;ll discuss today is to think positively and big. Too many of
us limit ourselves by what we think is possible. Remember, with God, all things are possible.
Some of us do to ourselves what Satan tries to do to Moses in Moses 1 of the Pearl of Great
Price. In Chapter 1, Moses was caught up in an exceedingly high mountain where he talked with
God. In verses 4, 6, and 7, God tries to show Moses what is possible. He repeatedly says,
&#8220;Moses, my son.&#8221; He wants Moses to know what his possibilities are. He wants him to think big.
Then, starting in verse 12, Moses is visited by Satan. What is the first thing that Satan tries to
do? He tries to get Moses to think little. He says, in verse 12, &#8220;Moses, son of man.&#8221; Too many of
us do the same thing. We limit ourselves internally by thinking things are too hard for us or that
we could never do that. Let me just say to you all, &#8220;you are all sons and daughters of God.&#8221;
Anything you work hard enough for is possible. Let me tell you a story of one of our sons.</p>
<p>Our third son is Tyler. Of our six children, I wouldn&#8217;t rank Tyler as the smartest or maybe not
even near the top of our kids&#8217; smart chart. In high school, he never got quite as good of grades as
most of our other children. When he got to college, because of his less-than-superior high school
academic experience, he realized that he was behind. In some ways, he hit a brick wall. Tyler
could have done two things. He could have given up, or he could try to climb the wall and get
over it. Fortunately, he did the latter. He decided that he needed to work extra hard to make up
for lost time. He did and, while his grades weren&#8217;t all straight A&#8217;s, his GPA rose considerably.
When it was time to take the Dental Aptitude Test (he wanted to be a dentist), he studied 12-15
hours a day for three months and ended up scoring in the 99th percentile in the country. He has
now finished dental school and this summer will start a pediatric dental residency at one of the
most prestigious hospitals in the country.</p>
<p>Just like he did to Moses, as recorded in Moses 1 of the Pearl of Great Price, Satan tries to
convince you every day that you are just a son of man. He wants you to believe that you are just
an average person. And, if you insist on being a member of the true, restored church, he wants
you to be just an average Mormon. He wants to convince you that you can lie a little, cheat a
little and sin a little and still be okay. But, we know differently. For, example, I know that I am a
son of God, just like I know that you are. I am one of Heavenly Father&#8217;s boys and he loves me
just like I love my children. You, too, are Heavenly Father&#8217;s boys and girls. And, I know that if I
live appropriately, I can be just like Him. In fact, as it says in the Oath and Covenant of the
Priesthood in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants, if I am worthy and magnify my
Priesthood, all that He has shall be given unto me and unto you. I hope I never lose sight of who
I am and I hope you don&#8217;t either. Satan will use every tool in the books to confuse you and try to
get you to forget who you are and to limit your vision and goals. He knows your weaknesses and
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Anything is possible if you think big enough and work hard to accomplish the goals. As one
other piece of evidence to show that anything is possible, think back to 1961 when John
Fitzerald Kennedy was president. At the time, the U.S. and Russia had started exploring space.</p>
<p>On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy stood before a joint session of Congress to declare it &#8220;time
for a great new American enterprise&#8212;time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space
achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.&#8221; First,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of
landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.&#8221; Kennedy&#8217;s goal was realized
on July 20, 1969 (8 years later). Apollo 11, of course, was the mission that put men on the moon,
with its astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. The 238,000-mile trip to
the moon took four days. Apollo 11 fell into orbit 60 miles above the moon's surface, and on July
20 at 1:45 p.m. EDT, the Eagle with Armstrong and Aldrin inside separated from Columbia. The
Eagle crew then put themselves into a 60-by-9-mile orbit. Neil Armstrong&#8217;s quote is now
famous: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." President Kennedy knew
that with a firm goal and hard work, anything was possible.</p>
<p>As another example of the value of having big goals, the 1952 graduating class of one of the Ivy
League schools was surveyed to see how many had specific goals at the time of graduation. Only
three percent of the class did. However, 50 years after graduation, it turns out that that 3 percent
with goals had earned more money than all the other 97 percent added together.</p>
<p>Considered together, these eight activities of (1) building a good reputation, (2) engaging in
continuous learning and education, (3) maintaining good physical health, (4) maintaining
financial freedom, (5) staying guilt free and having the Spirit in your life, (6) marrying wisely,
(7) building networks and (8) thinking big will bring you choices and opportunities in the future
that others won&#8217;t have and will allow you to act quicker than others to seize upon opportunities
that will come your way in this fast-paced world.</p>
<p>So how do you use this option-giving framework in your life? Every time you have a decision to
make, whether it is big or small, you should ask yourself this question: Which alternative will
give me the most and best options? And, for some decisions, the question will be in deciding
how not to have options taken away. For example, being immoral on a date, skipping class to go
skiing or engaging in other negative behaviors will reduce and can even eliminate options. With
the raising of the bar for missionaries, participating in certain activities can eliminate the option
of ever serving a full-time mission. Personally, I take this option approach to life very seriously.
Sometimes, the decisions are easy and require very little thinking to decide what to do. Other
times, they are difficult. For example, a couple of years ago, I had a potential career-changing
offer given to me. That decision required much prayer, fasting and going to the temple. In the
end, I decided that given our family priorities, turning down the opportunity actually provided
more and better options.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I promise you that if you will always make choices and decisions that give you
more options you will be happy and will have a great life. I also want you to know that I know
that decisions that are consistent with the Gospel are always option-increasing decisions and that
decisions that are inconsistent with the Gospel are also option-decreasing decisions. Any
decision that is not consistent with what Heavenly Father wants for us will only bring heartache
and sorrow, not increased options. I have a strong testimony that Heavenly Father wants us to be
free and to be successful. He wants us to make good choices. Living the Gospel is the only way
to have true happiness. That you may use this preparatory or &#8220;planting&#8221; period of your life to
create options for the future is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good afternoon to you good students--you&#8217;re a joy to see, a frightening joy for me--but a
beautiful one none the less. </p>
<p>To President and Sister Wilkes, all of the BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho family, my dear wife and children, and to
my wonderful parents--I am so grateful to be with you and grateful to call you my friends.  How
I love this special, special institution.  Being a part of this place has always been one of the great
blessings of my life.</p>
<p>To use the words that all of us have become so accustomed to hearing from Elder Bednar, I
sincerely invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost to be with me and to be with you during
these next few minutes that we will share together.  I know that if you will lend your prayers at
this time for that guidance for us both, you will be lead to ideas and promptings that will bless
your life and the lives of others around you.</p>
<p>Today as we meet together, I hope to share something of some value to all of us.  I am very
conscious of the accumulated value of your time.  I have been praying--that this will meaningful
for someone.  Here is what I hope will be the outcome of this devotional today: if I do my job
well and if you are receptive, we can learn together through the Spirit, the value and power for
deepening our spirituality.  I will use just a few simple scriptures that share a common theme or
a similar parable basis. Most of all, I pray that what has been prepared will be acceptable to our
Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>In a primarily agricultural area like southeast Idaho, there are special symbols that become
visible during this important time of year.  As students, most of you probably don&#8217;t come in
close contact with this because your worlds are focused on other activities, but a miracle of
nature is just now starting to awaken, to come alive.  Rain, sunshine, and warmer temperatures
begin to do their yearly work and initiate that age old cycle of new life.  Trees begin to bud,
flowers, and plants push up through the soil and all around us there is the beautiful promise of
new life.  Before we know it, this campus, the lawns around this town, the surrounding fields, the
wild grasses and plants in the deserts and the mountains--everything will be green, growing, and
beautiful again.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of God&#8217;s dealings with His children here on this earth, He has frequently
taught us using the imagery of such things as seeds, plants, vines, vineyards, wheat, weeds,
water, trees, and fruit.  These have always been everyday symbols that He chose to help His
children understand themselves, their actions, the effects of their choices, their purposes, their
rewards, and of His care and nurturing love towards all of us.</p>
<p>Several beautiful scriptures come to mind that deal with this idea of new life.  The first one that I
would ask you to turn to is found in the 13th chapter of Matthew.  Listen to the voice of the
Savior as He teaches us this very simple, but very meaningful parable: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and
devoured them up:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:  and forthwith they
sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when the sun was up, they were scorched;  and because they had no root,
they withered away.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold,
some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear 
		</i>(Matthew 13:3-9).</p>
<p>We can picture each of the seeds--the seeds by the wayside, in stony places, among thorns, and
in good ground.  And we can understand easily the meaning behind this parable.</p>
<p>Where else do we learn about seeds in the scriptures?  Like me, you probably think of Alma
chapter 32.  If I were to ask you what that particular chapter is about, most of you would
respond:  &#8220;the faith chapter.&#8221;  And that reaction is true, but today, there is another parable that is
found there that often gets overlooked.</p>
<p>In the middle of this chapter is a wonderful parable about a plant that begins from a tiny seed and
to quote Alma, that seed swells, enlarges, grows, enlightens, and expands.  Alma teaches us that
the seed is light and it is light that we can taste.  This is beautiful imagery that Alma paints for
us; and you and I are indebted to this great prophet for helping us understand the process of faith,
and the initiation that turns the desire to believe, into real and abiding testimony. But, if we don&#8217;t
read carefully on and think through a second analogy that Alma leaves us, we may miss a great
principle that is particularly relevant to all of us.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that we&#8217;ve been talking about spring and you are in the springtime of your lives. 
All of you will soon be transplanted, in a sense, from this little desert garden here in Idaho to
other gardens scattered throughout the world.  We think of that sort of thing with graduation and
summer coming on.  And so the questions of the hour that I would like to present to you are: 
how do we continue to develop and continue to learn spiritually, growing into deeper and more
satisfying soil? Do you see the need for your spiritual roots to go deeper? And most importantly,
how do you take this to the next level?</p>
<p>I hope that another of the outcomes of today&#8217;s devotional is the realization that there is a next
step in the process of faith.  For our purposes today, I will call this &#8220;spiritual nourishment.&#8221; 
What I have prepared are just a few simple ideas that I have noticed, or have been taught that
have led me to new spiritual nourishment.  I will attempt to weave those together with this idea
of nourishing that Alma is about to teach us.  I want to stress, however, that my thoughts are just
some ideas, some things that I have benefited from by knowing or noticing.  I hope that by
introducing these ideas, that it will allow you to see additional insights all of your own, or
insights that others more wise than I might share with you as you continue on your journey.  As
you are transplanted to other gardens in a much larger world, I believe that you can take with
you a spiritual self-reliance that will come from your efforts to nourish your faith and testimony.</p>
<p>Turn with me to this second parable taught by Alma.  Alma chapter 32, beginning in verse 37. 
Remember that the seed has been planted and has begun to grow and is already bringing forth
some very real rewards.  Beginning in verse 37, Alma taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say:  Let us nourish it with
great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. 
And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and
bring forth fruit </i>(Alma 32:37).</p>
<p>Do you see the next parable that Alma is sharing?  How do we nourish the faith and testimony
that we have already planted? Alma goes on:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will
not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it
hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out</i> (Alma 32:38).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit
thereof would not be desirable;  but it is because your ground is barren, and ye
will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof</i> (Alma 32:39).</p>
<p>Now we could talk about the familiar and important methods for building our spirituality:  on-going and sincere repentance, personal worthiness, deep and careful study, heartfelt prayer,
fasting, service to others, and patient endurance.  For our purposes today, I would like to assume
that we are already doing are best at most of these things.  Let&#8217;s look at the process of nourishing
a plant and see if that process might teach us something about our next steps in nourishing and
growing our faith and our testimonies.</p>
<p>We can find at least six distinct elements that are necessary to the process of nourishing a plant
to thrive and bear fruit.  Those elements necessary to that process are:  water, light, soil,
weeding, pruning, protecting, and waiting.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider them one at a time and compare them to nourishing ourselves spiritually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Symbolic and Nourishing Power of Water</span></p>
<p>First is water.  What is the symbolism of water?  Actually there are several.  Nephi taught from
his and his father&#8217;s visions that the living waters were the love of God (1 Nephi 11:25).  Christ
taught the woman at the well that the water He gave would be a well of water springing up unto
everlasting life (John 4:13-14).  He taught that those who drink His water would never thirst (3
Nephi 20:8) and He verified that He alone was able to drink the cup that His Father gave to him
(Matthew 20:22).  Water in its pure state is a beautiful substance to look at.  It is a substance that
maintains life as it cycles throughout this planet.  In a very real sense, the water you drank a few
minutes ago is a portion of the same water that was put here at the creation of the earth.  That
water has been through countless clouds, through deepest underwater reservoirs, through tiny
plants and tall, tall trees.  It has been here through all of the ages and eons of this earth.</p>
<p>What potential analogies are there here?  The first one that comes to my mind is that as that
water is eternal, so are you.  And as that water fulfills the great nurturing of life, so too can this
concept of your own eternal nature nourish your understanding of life and your purposes here--when you truly grasp it and truly believe it!</p>
<p>This powerful understanding of our eternal nature can give great spiritual nourishment to each of
us.  Let me illustrate.  When my yardstick for measuring the value of things that are presented to
me each day, or things that are available to occupy my time, is calibrated to an eternal measure, I
weigh matters in a fundamentally different manner.  Additionally, I find that because of this
eternal perspective, I hear and see things that I otherwise would miss.  Let me say that again in a
slightly different way: because of interest in and concern for this nourishing process, you will
hear and see things in the gospel message that others would likely miss.  The Savior called these
things <i>&#8220;hidden treasures&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 89:19)--hidden treasures that would be
found by those who have ears to hear and eyes to see.</p>
<p>Elder Widtsoe said this about the empowerment of an eternal perspective--this nourishment of
deep, clear waters:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The mighty perspective of eternity is unraveled before us . . . ; we see time from
its infinite beginning to its endless end; and the drama of eternal life is unfolded
before us. Then I see more clearly my place amidst the things of the universe, my
place among the purposes of God;  I am better able to place myself where I
belong, and I am better able to value and to weigh, to separate and to organize
the common, ordinary duties of my life, so that the little things shall not oppress
me or take away my vision of the greater things that God has given us </i>(John A.
Widtsoe, Conference Report, April 1922, pp. 97-98).</p>
<p>People with this eternal perspective find it hard to distinguish where time ends and eternity
begins--they sense the continuum from their previous lives with this life here on earth, and with
their lives to come.  People with this understanding sense the value of &#8220;the things which are
prepared for them.&#8221; The Lord teaches us in the 78th section of the Doctrine and Covenants that,
		<i>&#8220;Satan seeketh to turn </i>[our]<i> hearts away from the truth, that [we] become blinded and
understand not the things which are prepared for </i>[us]&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 78:10).  Joseph
Smith taught that the gospel was restored to &#8220;teach us who we are.&#8221; Therefore, strategically
speaking, Satan&#8217;s objectives must be to teach us who we are not.</p>
<p>You and I build and nourish our spirituality, providing those roots with pure, satisfying water in
a significant way just simply through understanding who we really are. &#8220;Behold,&#8221; the Lord said
to Moses--and would say to each of us--&#8220;you are my son [or my daughter]&#8221; . . . and significantly,
&#8220;thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten.&#8221; We are truly like our Savior in more ways
than we are different from Him, brothers and sisters.  Moses himself used that very thought to
withstand a highly charged confrontation with Satan.  You and I will hopefully never face such a
direct challenge, but in our own individual temptations, this knowledge of our eternal nature can
be one key of deliverance.  The great Jehovah told Moses that He knows us all, and all things are
numbered to Him,  &#8220;for they are mine&#8221; (Moses 1:4, 6, 35).  What a grand and enabling concept
this is!</p>
<p>Finally, we can&#8217;t leave this subject of water and it&#8217;s nourishing value without remembering these
important words:  <i>&#8220;Oh God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus
Christ, to bless and sanctify this</i> [water] <i>to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do
it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
20:79).  In a very real sense, we nourish our spirits  on a weekly basis each time we partake of
the sacrament.  This nourishing power of water, and all that it symbolizes, is a critical element
for our spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Symbolic and Nourishing Power of Light</span></p>
<p>A second part to the process of nourishing can be found in the symbolism of light.  The apostle
John teaches us in a powerful and symbolic way about the Savior and light.  He taught:  
		<i>&#8220;In
[Christ] was life; and the life was the light of men&#8221; </i>(John 1:4).  In modern scripture, we learn
that the light of Christ is literally in the sun, the earth, the moon, and the stars.  And that the
mingling of the Savior&#8217;s power and natural light itself are the powers by which each of these
spheres were made.  And then this modern-day revelation takes the concept of light to a more
glorious and at the same time a more personal level, when it teaches that this light &#8220;enlighteneth
your eyes&#8221; and &#8220;quickeneth your understanding&#8221; and is somehow &#8220;the law by which all things
are governed, even the power of God . . .&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenant 88:7-13).  The natural light
that shines around us on a beautiful spring day is a marvel in itself and is literally the power of
life.</p>
<p>So how is this idea of light relevant to our need for the on-going nourishing of our faith and
testimony as Alma taught?  Just as light is divided by darkness in the day and night cycle of this
earth, we will be profited by a personal division between the profane and the sacred.  Although
&#8220;profane&#8221; can mean &#8220;showing contempt for the things of God&#8221;, it&#8217;s secondary meaning is
probably one that hits a little closer to home for most of us:  &#8220;Showing disinterest for the things
of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Symbolically speaking, light of course represents truth and righteousness, while darkness
represents error and wickedness.</p>
<p>All around us on any given day, we are surrounded by darkness and the profane--we are truly &#8220;in
the world.&#8221;  This darkness can be alluring and it is persistently inviting us to use our time, our
attention, and our energy on it&#8217;s prolific offerings.  Many--maybe even most--of these offerings
are seemingly not that dark, perhaps they even seem quite light.  An example of this would be
the amount of discretionary time and means that are available to us.  In the midst of all the
glamour, glitz, and noise, it is interesting to me to think that our Father in Heaven would choose
a plan for His children that is based on a still and small voice, on self-discipline, and obedience. 
His plan would require faith in things not seen, when all around us there would be tantalizing
things that could be seen.  Our Father&#8217;s plan would require acting and then accepting
consequences, and would require patience and endurance.</p>
<p>Today, our world is fully the opposite of each of these characteristics of the gospel plan.  How
do we distinguish between what is eternally important and what is merely a diversion in our real
lives--our eternal lives?  How do we expose the plants of our faith and testimony to a fuller
nourishment filled with light?  How do we make ourselves more receptive to the things of God? 
		</p>
<p>There are many ways that we can use this light to discern the profane from the sacred.  One way
that I have noticed in my own life is to take the words of God more literally and hold them more
reverently.  Samuel the prophet of the Old Testament--even as a boy--&#8220;did let none of [God&#8217;s]
words fall to the ground&#8221; (1 Samuel 3:19).</p>
<p>The author Dennis Rasmussen, in the book, The Lord&#8217;s Question, puts it quite beautifully in this
way:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who can comprehend the power of sacred words? Who can say what things they
teach [those] whose ears and tongues are trained by the words of God?  My
language sets the limits of my world.  Fortunate are they who have learned the
language that teaches of God, for their world will be filled with His presence.</i></p>
<p>&#160;Brother Rasmussen continues, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>These words give light . . .  No one can see the world aright who does not see it in
the light of God.  No one can understand the purpose of life who has not found it
in the teachings of God.  How harsh and empty are the tunes of temptation in the
ears of those who have heard the hymns of heaven</i> (The Lord&#8217;s Question, pp. 27-28).</p>
<p>Another way we can successfully discern the profane from the sacred also deals with words.  We
live in a day where our language is filled with a high degree of casualness.  Elder Russell M.
Nelson on this campus said:  &#8220;Language reflects refinement . . . your manner of speech will stand
in stark contrast to the lazy language of our day.&#8221;  He then quotes President Hinckley who said,
&#8220;sloppy language portends sloppy ways.&#8221;  Elder Nelson then encouraged the students at BYU-Idaho to pattern their manners and their language after President Hinckley&#8217;s, who he called
&#8220;elegant and eloquent.&#8221; </p>
<p>Laziness and sloppiness in language, Elder Nelson teaches, &#8220;portends&#8221; other sloppiness in our
lives.  Portend means to predict.  What other forms of sloppiness could be predicted to creep into
our lives and spread their darkness when we accept sloppy language? </p>
<p>Some of the concerns among the leaders of the Church generally and the leaders of the Church
on our campus include irreverence in our language as we address deity in prayer and casualness
in dress as we attend one of the most sacred meetings of all, sacrament meeting.  We could ask
ourselves, how does this casualness lap over into our approach towards sincere repentance or our
ability to receive the guidance of the Holy Spirit? President Boyd K. Packer said that:
&#8220;<i>Irreverence suits the purposes of the adversary by obstructing the delicate channels of
revelation in both mind and spirit&#8221;</i> and he added:   &#8220;[The] <i>trend to more noise, more excitement,
more contention, less restraint, less dignity, less formality is not coincidental nor innocent nor
harmless</i>&#8221; (Ensign, November 1991, p. 23).</p>
<p>I am sure there are many other possible parallels that could be drawn between the power of light
to dispel the profane, and our ability to nourish our spirituality on an on-going and meaningful
way.  But it is clear to me that just as a plant requires light to grow and thrive, our faith and
testimonies also require the light of discernment that comes freely to us from our Savior.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Symbolic and Nourishing Power of Soil</span></p>
<p>Third on my list is soil.  Soil is so simple--it is earth, the basis of creation, the dust from which
everything was formed.  It is matter and it cannot be created and it cannot be destroyed.  Soil is
one of the main mediums for the nutrients of life.  Good soil is both soft and pliable, while at the
same time it has the ability to protect.  The Savior taught of &#8220;good ground&#8221; versus &#8220;no deepness
of earth&#8221; in the parable that we read in Matthew 13. </p>
<p>So what can we learn about nourishing our spirituality by this symbolism of soil?  For me, I see
several possible lessons, all of which center on the concept of simplicity.  It is always interesting
to me how the Savior used such simple forms for teaching: seeds, figs, sparrows, and many,
many more common yet symbolic images.</p>
<p>The simple in our lives can have so many connotations.  We could talk about simple truths.  Of
that, Heber C. Kimball said:  <i>&#8220;Those things which appeared the most mysterious will prove to be
the most simple&#8221;</i> (Heber C. Kimball, Journal of Discourses, Volume 3, p. 112).</p>
<p>What other forms of simplicity are there that could bring significant spiritual nourishment to us?
I think of simplicity of living.  I propose to you that the more simple and unburdened that we live
our lives, the more likely we are to find true happiness and those &#8220;hidden treasures. 
Additionally, what of accepting simplicity in our surroundings? We live in a very affluent world. 
Even those of us who are considered &#8220;middle-class&#8221; in this country enjoy a standard of living
far, far above so much of the rest of the world.  We also live in a day and age where the &#8220;new&#8221; is
very desirable. But an important question is, what is the affect of the &#8220;new&#8221; on our ability to
discern between needs and our wants?  Too much of the &#8220;new&#8221;, acquired in too short of time,
can lead to long-term burdens that are not always apparent initially and which may be difficult to
undo later.  Many people have given away much in order to have these things--peace of mind
and simplicity of means being two things in particular that are being lost today.  We can learn so
much by watching the Brethren.  Did you know that many of the First Presidency and the
Twelve live in very ordinary homes where they have lived for decades--the very homes where
they raised their families, and where they have worked with their own hands to build and to
improve them?</p>
<p>Another way of looking at simplicity is found in the last chapter of the Book of Romans.  There
Paul teaches the Saints in worldly Rome this idea:  <i>&#8220;I would have you wise unto that which is
good, and simple concerning evil&#8221;</i> (Romans 16:19). How does that relate to this idea of
nourishing?  To maintain good soil for the nourishing of our individual trees of faith, we cannot
pollute it with harsh chemicals.  They will kill the plant.  The harsh chemicals of today that
damage our spiritual soil include anything that keeps you or I from the things of God. I think of
the acidity of pornography and other degrading media that can include television, movies, music,
and games.</p>
<p>Finally on this concept of good soil and the nourishment for our spiritual lives, I am reminded of
some powerful words of the prophet Nephi where he said this to all of us who need to push
deeper into the living soil of the gospel--this comes from the 32nd chapter of the Second book of
Nephi:  <i>&#8220;If ye cannot understand </i>[these words<i>,&#8221;</i> and I think that Nephi might call them: simple
words, <i>&#8220;it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the
light . . . for </i>[ye] <i>will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given
unto </i>[you] <i>in plainness, even as plain as word can be&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 32:4, 7).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Nourishment in Action:  Weeding, Pruning, Protecting, and  Waiting</span></p>
<p>Now let me introduce my last four ideas--I will call these &#8220;nourishment in action.</p>
<p>The first action that is required is weeding.  What are the possible lessons for nurturing a more
spiritual life that we learn from the concept of weeding?  We learn that weeding takes time and
consistent, enduring effort that is a life-long challenge.  I hope that all of you have had the
experience of weeding a garden before--it&#8217;s character building.  What do weeds represent as it
relates to spirituality?  Thorns in Matthew chapter 13 were what?--cares of the world.  What do
aggressive weeds do to good plants?  They rob vital nutrients and in the end if there is no
weeding, the bad will overcome the good.  Think of how young tare plants look like young grain
plants--what lessons for life are in there? One interpretation could be the difficulty of
distinguishing good from evil in early temptations.  We could mention the bitter fruit of wild
olive-trees, and we could talk of pests such as fowls that come and snatch away seeds of truth
before they can be understood.  There are wonderful lessons to be considered here, brothers and
sisters--lessons that have great implications to our spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>What about pruning?  I&#8217;m sure that this second nourishment in action can be understood from
many angles.  One example that comes to my mind is where Christ taught that He himself was
the true vine and that His father was the husbandman (John 15:1).  What did the Lord mean
when He said, <i>&#8220;Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he</i> [His Father] 
		<i>taketh away: and every
branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit&#8221;</i> (John 15:2). This
purging and pruning process sounds potentially painful.  What is the role of trials, suffering, and
sacrifice in the nourishing of deeper spiritual roots?  Challenges can have the effect of sending
our roots deeper into good soil and strengthening us against the inevitable storms of life.  With
the right spiritual eyes, can you and I have the faith to submit and let this tutoring verb operate in
us?</p>
<p>How about protecting?  Just as a farmer must protect his plants from storm, disease, drought, and
infestations, so must we do the same for our spirituality.  How do each of those relate to the
protection of our spiritual health?  Let&#8217;s use the symbol of a storm from this list as an
illustration.  And note that what we do with the symbol of a storm could be done with each of
these other farming challenges.</p>
<p>Come back with me to the 26th chapter of Alma.  Ammon is speaking here and he uses the same
analogy of a plant that has been nourished and grown to full fruition.  He talks about the
finishing of the work when the fruit is fully ready to be harvested and gathered in before stormy
weather.  Ammon is speaking of sheaves, which is a method of stacking harvested stalks of
grain.  Beginning in verse 6, Ammon taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, they</i> [the sheaves--the children of the kingdom] 
		<i>shall not be beaten down by
the storm at the last day;  yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the
whirlwinds;  but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their
place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them;  yea, neither shall they be driven
with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.  But behold, they
are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise
them up at the last day </i>(Alma 26:6-7).</p>
<p>That is a beautiful analogy, isn&#8217;t it?  Through the protecting hand of a loving, caring, attentive
master farmer, an eventual and bountiful harvest is made a reality.</p>
<p>Now finally to the last action--waiting.  We could come up with many possible interpretations
for this symbol, but right away, I think of pondering.  One of my favorite stories from the life of
President Hinckley is the rather simple story that he shares from his youth of frequently seeing
his father sitting on a low stone wall in their yard with a tool in hand, lost in thought, pondering
on the things that mattered most to him.  In so many ways, such opportunities are lost in our
society today--unless you and I make a conscious effort to create them.  It is a choice we can
make to live simply and quietly.  President Packer said, &#8220;inspiration comes in peaceful settings.&#8221; 
There are other analogies that come to mind.  Without faith and patience, a farmer will never
harvest a single crop.  In our Church you often hear references to the &#8220;law of the harvest&#8221;.  What
does that mean in our context today?  Farming is waiting and so it is with spiritual nourishment. 
Endurance is required for both, but in the end, the fruit of the labor is often labor itself.  I invite
you to turn back to Alma 32 and go with me to the end of the chapter.  In verses 41 and 42, Alma
explains the rewards for nourishing our faith and testimony:</p>
<p>&#8220;But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with
great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and
behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.  And because of your diligence and
your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold,
by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is
sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye
shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst&#8221;. 
(Alma 32:41-42)</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what we have done here today is to take just a few passages of scriptures
that have a central theme.  We have explored the possible lessons for life, particularly how we
can take our faith and testimony to deeper more meaningful levels.  As you seek to do just that in
your life--patiently and consistently--I promise you that you will find applications and
correlations with other parables of the Savior and with the words of His servants the prophets,
that will open great vistas of meanings, even &#8220;hidden treasures&#8221; that will bless your life,
particularly your eternal life.</p>
<p>I testify that these vistas, these hidden treasures are in reality the fruit spoken of by Alma, fruit
that is &#8220;sweet above all that is sweet&#8221;.  And that fruit is the greatest reality and truth of them all:
the atonement of Jesus Christ.  I further testify that His atonement was the ultimate act of
courage and selflessness and the consequence of His life, His love, and His courage has not only
eternal implications for all humanity, but also has implications for you and for me on profoundly
personal levels.</p>
<p>I know that as you and I focus on this most significant event throughout our entire lives, then
line upon line, feeling upon feeling, hungering upon thirsting, through passing years, we will
taste of that precious fruit offered by the Father to all those who love His Son and who serve His
children.  I testify to you that the atonement is the very center of all true spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>I prayerfully ask that I can be gathered together in my place and that that place might be with my
eternal Parents and my Savior, Jesus Christ, and with all others that I love so dearly on this earth
and who I long to be with eternally.  And I pray the same for each of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;The Third Great Commandment and Other Thoughts&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</p>
<p style="text-align: center">April 23, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland</p>
<p>I am thrilled to be with you today for these commencement exercises. Due to my recent
assignment in Latin America (any Chilean missionaries in the crowd? Bien hecho, compa&ntilde;eros.
Felicitaciones. Le amo), it has been some time since anyone has even let me enter the Rexburg
city limits, let alone actually mix and mingle with the students and faculty. I am grateful it was
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> graduating class that, after asking if there weren&#8217;t any other of the Brethren available, said,
&#8220;Oh, what the heck. Let&#8217;s let Elder Holland come. Surely he can&#8217;t do much to ruin the fun of a
commencement day.&#8221; I promise to be worthy of your trust.</p>
<p>Now, in that spirit and realizing I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer, I do remember
something about college days and college students. One of the things I remember is that
graduation day is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> a time when students urgently demand, plead from the rooftops for, and
absolutely insist upon long-winded speakers. On a day like this for some mysterious reason other
things are on your minds. Furthermore, if my 30 years of coming to Rexburg serve me well, I
vaguely remember that the wind blows pretty regularly here even without public speakers. So I
will do my part and try to avoid adding unduly to that perennial breeze this glorious spring
morning.</p>
<p>I would leave just three thoughts with you on this very happy occasion, all in the spirit of the
love and commendation I feel for you and for your accomplishments today.</p>
<p>The first stems from something I have repeatedly run into in the scriptures lately. Perhaps I have
seen this so often recently because I need it, but it strikes me perhaps you could benefit from it as
well. The idea is summarized in several verses&#8212;a rather stern warning, actually&#8212;in the 59<sup>th</sup>
section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Here the Lord is urging the people toward a Zion-like
manner of living and He rehearses the importance of the very basic commandments He has
always given His children down through the ages of time. That first commandment is to 
		<i>&#8220;love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, . . . might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus
Christ, . . . serve Him&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 59:5).<i> </i>This we have been told from the
beginning of time is the supreme commandment. The second great commandment always
follows&#8212;to <i>&#8220;love thy neighbor as thyself&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 59:6). Then, here in the 59<sup>th</sup>
section the Lord adds a <span style="text-decoration: underline">third</span> great commandment for a redeemed people for those who seek for
the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This third great commandment is that <i>&#8220;thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 59:7). And in this obligation we must be as faithful as in the first two:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The fulness of the earth is yours,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">[All]<i> good things . . . 
		</i>[are] <i>for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the
eye and to gladden the heart, </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">[Things] <i>to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul. 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; . . . 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">[But] <i>in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save
those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments
</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 16-21).</p>
<p>So in all of the fun and friendship today, with all the happiness you have earned and so richly
deserve, with accomplishment in all that has gone before and anticipation and excitement over
all that lies ahead, please pause sometime in this glorious weekend (even right this moment if
you choose) and thank your Father in Heaven for His goodness, His kindness, His blessings to
you.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I have confronted this commandment in the scriptures the last
few weeks. I don&#8217;t need to rehearse all of those incidents but in doing some work in the Book of
Mormon, I was referencing one of my all-time favorite scriptures, Alma 7:23, and read again
there that we could ask for anything, for <i>&#8220;whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and
temporal;&#8221; </i>but with the proviso that we <i>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">always 
		</span></i><span style="text-decoration: underline">[return] <i>thanks unto God for whatsoever things
ye do receive.</i></span>&#8221;<i> </i>Prior to that I had been reading in King Benjamin&#8217;s sermon where he said to his
people:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, . . . do merit
any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly King! </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I say unto you . . . if you should render all the thanks and praise which your
whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept
and preserved you, . . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . .Yet ye would be unprofitable servants 
		</i>(Mosiah 2:19-21).</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across Alma the Elder trying to establish the Church after a tragic era of
apostasy. His efforts are summarized in one short verse&#8212;a very simple two-fold formula&#8212;that
says his people were <i>&#8220;commanded . . . to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things&#8221;
		</i>(Mosiah 26:39). And so it went with me for day after day of my scripture study. Gratitude.
Thankfulness. Appreciation. Acknowledgement. It seemed to pop up everywhere. Then it struck
me that that really is about all we can give back to God who already has every possession. He
who is master of the universe doesn&#8217;t need the keys to your car or your Viking sweatshirt. There
is nothing you have that He doesn&#8217;t already have a lot more of. The one thing he may not
have&#8212;but certainly deserves!&#8212;is your gratitude and loyalty, your appreciation and devotion, in
short-your love.</p>
<p>So my first request of you today is to show your gratitude to God for the blessings of a
wonderful life, including a magnificent experience at BYU-Idaho. In the process take time to
thank others who have been His agents in providing those blessings&#8212;thank your parents and
thank your teachers. Thank your friends and thank your bishop. Thank President Hinckley and
President Wilkes, and the tithe-payers of the Church. Thank the groundskeepers. Thank the
cafeteria staff. Thank everyone. They have all blessed you and have made your BYU-Idaho
experience the precious memory it now becomes. Gratitude is something that costs you nothing
and means everything to those who receive it. Be thankful! If I could sing, I would offer this
hymn for all of us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now thank we all our God/With hearts and hands and voices,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who wondrous things that done,/In whom His earth rejoices;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who, from our mothers&#8217; arms,/Hath blessed us on our way</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>With countless gifts of love,/ and still is ours today</i> (Hymn #95, Now Thank We
All Our God). </p>
<p>Secondly, may I ask you to have faith in your future. We live in sobering, even dangerous, times
but actually life in this world has always been a little dangerous, so we cannot and must not be
paralyzed by fear. We cannot stop living life. Indeed, we should live life more fully than we have
ever lived it before. After all, this is the dispensation of the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">fulness</span> of times.</p>
<p>I say this because in recent months I have heard very fearful and even dismal opinions coming
from some in your age group. I have heard that you wonder whether there is any purpose in
going on a mission or getting an education or planning for a career if the world we live in is
going to be so uncertain. I have even heard sweethearts say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know whether we should
get married in such uncertain times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worst of all, I have heard reports of some newlyweds questioning whether they should bring
children into a terror-filled world on the brink of latter-day cataclysms.</p>
<p>I have just two things to say to any of you who are troubled about the future. I say it lovingly and
from my heart.</p>
<p>First, we must never, in any age or circumstance, let fear and the father of fear (Satan himself)
divert us from our faith and faithful living. There have always been questions about the future.
Every young person or every young couple in every era has had to walk by faith into what has
always been some uncertainty&#8212;starting with Adam and Eve in those first tremulous steps out of
the Garden of Eden. But that is all right. This is the plan. It will be okay. Just be faithful. God is
in charge. He knows your name and He knows your need.</p>
<p>Our Father in Heaven expects you to have enough faith and determination, and enough trust in
Him, to keep moving, keep living, keep rejoicing. In fact, He expects you not simply to face the
future (that sounds pretty grim and stoic); He expects you to embrace and shape the future&#8212;to
love it and rejoice in it and delight in your opportunities. God is anxiously waiting for the chance
to answer your prayers and fulfill your dreams, just as He always has. So pray on, dream on, and
move ahead, &#8220;with faith in every footstep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Third and lastly, with all of your new freedom and the prospects for a bright future, may I ask
you to remember one absolutely essential lesson from the past. The example I share with you is
from English history and is memorialized by the pen of the greatest writer in the history of the
English language. But it is a lesson as near to you as your own life or that of the friend sitting
next to you or the events of next week and next month and next year. </p>
<p>I speak of the confusion and ultimate destruction of a very powerful man, who was on the stage
of events in that pivotal Tudor period in England when the whole world was changed because
Henry VIII wanted a divorce. My, upon what small hinges the doors of personal and world
history swing! In Henry&#8217;s determination to be rid of Catherine of Aragon and gain the hand of
Anne Boleyn, he turned to this counselor and confidant, the second most powerful man in the
British realm, the masterful Thomas Wolsey. Son of an uneducated Suffolk butcher, Wolsey&#8217;s
driving ambition and immense talent brought him rapid rise through Oxford University and into
the Church where he quickly became chaplain to Henry VII. Then when young Henry VIII
ascended to the throne, Wolsey&#8217;s fortunes prospered even more dramatically. In addition to high
church positions, including Archbishop of York and finally cardinal, he became the most
influential member of the king&#8217;s Privy Council. Quickly enough he was the controlling figure in
all matters of state and every political move made by his monarch. He loved display and wealth.
He lived in royal splendor and reveled in his power.</p>
<p>Then Anne Boleyn came onto the scene. Young Henry was determined to move heaven, earth,
Catherine, and church doctrine to have her, but the obstacles were near insurmountable. He told
Wolsey to surmount them. Wolsey could not and did not. The failure proved to be fatal.</p>
<p>In spite of such a remarkable and virtually unprecedented rise to political power, Wolsey&#8217;s fall
was sudden and very complete. Stripped of every office he held and all property he possessed, he
was accused of treason and ordered to appear in London. In great distress he set out for the
capital to be tried. On the way he fell ill and died.</p>
<p>With the help of William Shakespeare (who sends his congratulations to you today and asked to 
		</p>
<p>be remembered), I invite you to hear Cardinal Wolsey&#8217;s &#8220;farewell&#8221; lament before leaving for
London and, as it turned out, death.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>On this commencement day a once-powerful British friend issues a caution to you against that
maneuvering of the ladder of success which only too late lets you discover it was leaning against
the wrong wall. &#8220;Blushing honors&#8221; as the world bestows them? They are inexorably nipped by a
killing frost. &#8220;High blown pride?&#8221; It will always break under us and, like children swimming in a
sea of glory, we will one day find ourselves beyond our depth. Weary, old with service, life
closing in disappointment and disrepute, Wolsey &#8220;falls like Lucifer, never to hope again.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a tragic end to such a gifted beginning! What a pathetic farewell to a life that held such
promise! And where did it go wrong? <span style="text-decoration: underline">It went wrong when ambition became more important than
conviction; when corruption transcended fidelity; when power and wealth created a thirst for
material goods that honest living could not satisfy</span>. Could there be sadder words than these from
the lips of a BYU-Idaho graduate fifty or sixty or seventy years from today: &#8220;Vain pomp and
glory of this world, I hate ye. Had I but serv&#8217;d my God with half the zeal I serv&#8217;d my King [or
my company or my country club or my BMW], he would not in mine age have left me naked to
mine enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>For BYU-Idaho students it must be the kingdom of God first and forever. Eternal possessions.
The restored gospel. Family and friends. Truth and industry and love. Humility and sacrifice and
faith. As you stand on the threshold of your bright and beautiful future, may heaven strip from
you this very hour, this very instant, any budding taste you may be acquiring for unseemly
wealth or authoritarian power or worldly acclaim. I pray you will always have money sufficient
for your needs and I pray you will exert a 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">righteous</span> influence wherever life&#8217;s journey takes you
in the business and professional world, but I ask you not to be lured by the siren song of avarice
and greed, or the quest for unrighteous dominion over your fellow men and women.</p>
<p>Student life and student wages should have already taught you that to be happy you do not need
the most expensive car, the most fashionable clothing, nor the most elegant furnishings in your
home. Furthermore, in the years ahead, neither your self-esteem nor your standing before God
will hinge on being at the top of the corporate pyramid.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t advance yourself through compromise. Don&#8217;t feather your nest with what you&#8217;ve plucked
dishonorably from another. Remember that in the end, surely God will be looking only for clean
hands, not full ones.</p>
<p>My young friends, congratulations on this special day. I love you and I leave an apostolic
blessing upon each one of you for the good lives you have led, the accomplishments you have
realized, and the wonderful world that lies ahead of you. In so doing I speak as one authorized to
convey to you the love of your Father in Heaven and the merciful care, now and always, of the
Lord Jesus Christ. I testify of Him and the glorious gospel promises and blessings He has
restored to the earth. May the teachings of that gospel, so inextricably linked with the teachings
of this wonderful institution, go with you and your loved ones always and everywhere I pray in
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</p>
<p style="text-align: center">April 23, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Interim President Robert M. Wilkes</p>
<p>The account of Chief Joseph&#8217;s Nez Perce Indians and their pursuit of freedom along the almost
1,200-mile trail that led from their homeland in the Wallowa Valley of Eastern Washington,
through Idaho to Island Park and the Yellowstone country, then on to the Bear&#8217;s Paw Mountains
of Northern Montana is an impressive saga. It was at the Bear&#8217;s Paw battlefield that Chief
Joseph, with prophetic finality, made his historic pronouncement: &#8220;From where the sun now
stands I will fight no more forever&#8221; (Helen Addison Howard, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Saga of Chief Joseph</span>, University
of Nebraska Press, p. 330).</p>
<p>During an earlier engagement of the conflict at the Big Hole battlefield near the Northern Idaho-Southern Montana border, the Nez Perce were surrounded by troops of the United States Cavalry
and attacked in the early morning&#8217;s light. The Indians were encumbered by their herd of
approximately 1,500 horses and the reality that their tribe of nearly 750 was largely made up of
older men, women, and children&#8212;with relatively few warriors. The circumstance favored the
soldiers so overwhelmingly that the capture of the Indians and their return to a reservation home
seemed all but certain. The battle commenced along a small stream and in the nearby woods.
Initially taken by surprise and outmanned, the Nez Perce slowly began to turn the tide of the
battle. How, against such odds, they were able to win the day and temporarily escape the
clutches of their would-be enforcers is instructive.</p>
<p>They did it by virtue of independent, responsible action; good judgment; and courage. It was
&#8220;their way,&#8221; when faced with challenge, to act on their own volition in the best interest of their
families and community. In short, they assumed personal responsibility for the eventual outcome
and they individually made a difference.</p>
<p>The soldiers also were trained to act&#8212;but only after they had been commanded. For the army,
there was a critical time delay between recognizing a need and acting to address it. Personal
judgment and skill were somewhat mitigated as they awaited instruction. This seemingly small
difference was a vital factor in the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>I reference this episode as a model for observations I wish to make relative to students, faculty,
staff, and administrators of Brigham Young University-Idaho. In November of 2004, this
institution lost its president for reasons that are well known and affectionately sustained. The
November devotional presented by the Bednars was a touching moment of departure.
Spontaneous singing occurred, tears were shed, and gestures of love and good wishes were
exchanged.</p>
<p>Following all of that, a long line of students formed for the purpose of greeting and welcoming
Estella and me to our recently appointed duties. We were grateful for the many expressions of
encouragement: &#8220;We will help you&#8221;; &#8220;We will do our part&#8221;; &#8220;We know we can make this work&#8221;;
&#8220;You can count on me&#8221;; &#8220;We will stand together, it will all work out.&#8221; They were unsolicited,
honest expressions from students who, like Chief Joseph&#8217;s Nez Perce, saw a need and were
prepared to respond. You knew you could make a difference, and you stepped forward willingly
and independently to do so.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that not only students, but the vast majority of those affiliated with this
institution have undertaken to act in the best interest of the BYU-Idaho community. Each of you
has contributed to our moving on by acting on issues and needs that were appropriately within
your purview to address&#8212;doing so on the basis of personal capacity and judgment. You,
students and employees alike, collectively willed the university to press forward on its charted
course. You had been trained to do so. And you did it for the cause you have embraced, the
cause to which you have committed your discipleship&#8212;of which this institution is a part.</p>
<p>Even more to the point, I trust you will carry these patterns of involvement with you as you
move to the next level of engagement with spouses, children, careers, and service. The pattern
will serve your future even as it serves the present and, in a related way, as it served the
historical past of Chief Joseph and his people.</p>
<p>Your positive and helpful response to the delay in appointing the next permanent president&#8212;and
the resulting interim period required&#8212;came as no surprise to Estella and me. We have known
you, and others like you, for most of our lives! We have seen you both under siege and on green
pastures. We know something of your hearts. We were confident that, as a family of learners and
teachers, you would move the school forward and not back. You persisted because you
understood that more was at stake than your own priorities and preferences. You were aware of
close parallels between the action called for and the patterns of the kingdom. Your response to
the change really was closely akin to the ways of the Lord. To 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">know,</span> to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">act, </span>and to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">do</span>&#8212;all
essential elements of a disciple&#8217;s identity. We learn from scripture:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And this is life eternal, that they might 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">know</span> thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent</i> (John 17:3, emphasis added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">act </span>for himself . . . .</i>
(2&#160;Nephi 2:16, emphasis added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">act </span>in the office in which he
is appointed, in all diligence</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 107:99, emphasis added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; . . . . Verily I say,
men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">do </span>many things of their
own free will . . . ; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto
themselves.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 58:26-29, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Estella and I commend you, as graduates, for 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">knowing</span>, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">acting</span>, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">doing</span>! We admire you for
your faith and for your sustaining and steadying influence on issues that matter to each of us,
both individually and collectively, and to the Lord. We compliment the mothers, fathers, and
families who gave you life and committed themselves to your happiness.</p>
<p>We testify that God is our Father, His only begotten son is our Savior, and Gordon B. Hinckley
is their prophet. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>My beloved young people&#8212;<span style="text-decoration: underline">even the very youth of Zion</span>, what a joy it is to be with you today
and speak to you about matters of importance. Do not take offence to being called the youth of
Zion, anyone under 40 to me is youthful. As I look over this congregation and know that many
more are listening in other locations, I tell you most sincerely that I take great comfort in the
strength of the rising generations who will be called upon to lead the church and Kingdom of
God in these last days.<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been blessed with the privilege in the last few years of sitting at the feet of Prophets and
Apostles while being taught the truths of the Kingdom. Today I wish to share with you how
those truths have effected my life, even my eternal life&#8212;and will effect your eternal life as well.
If you listen with real intent the spirit will prompt you by the words or scriptures we discuss.
You can receive answers or new insight to that which may be of concern to you. The spirit will
testify to you that which you should do. The most important note you take will not be what I say,
but what you are prompted to do as you listen to the Spirit. I pray for that Spirit to be with us.</p>
<p>This year we celebrate two very important events in the history of the Church. December 23<sup>rd</sup>
will mark the two hundredth birthday of the Prophet Joseph Smith and this past April 6<sup>th</sup> we
celebrated the 175<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the organization of the Church. Because of the important and
historical significance of these events, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
have designated 2005 as a &#8220;Year of Celebration.&#8221; </p>
<p>Reflecting on the life of the Prophet Joseph has given me focus for my remarks today, which is:</p>
<p>&#8220;Living to Receive Spiritual Promptings and Personal Revelation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Savior&#8217;s final days and hours of mortality were spent in teaching and preparing his disciples
for the time when He would no longer dwell among them in mortality. Perhaps His most
important instruction was that He would send them another Comforter. Let&#8217;s refer to a few
verses of scripture in John Chapters 14, 15 and 16. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But the Comforter, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">which</span><span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you</i> (John 14:26, emphasis added). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">even</span>
the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me 
		</i>(John
15:26, emphasis added). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go
not away, the Comforter will not come, but if I depart, I will send him unto you
		</i>(John 16:7)</p>
<p>The Savior wanted His disciples to rely on the Comforter for their spiritual guidance and
direction since He would no longer be with them in the flesh. As the Savior gave that direction to
his disciples, so He has given the same to each one of us. </p>
<p>As a young boy, Joseph needed and received spiritual guidance to find the truth. He listened with
interest to the doctrines taught by the ministers in several denominations in upstate New York.
But the more he heard, the more confused he became. </p>
<p>Continuing his desire to find the truth, he opened the bible and came upon a passage of scripture
in James 1:5 and read,<i> &#8220;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.&#8221;</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-right: -0.25in">The faith of this lad of 14 is nothing short of miraculous.<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>Joseph sought refuge in a nearby grove of
trees to courageously act upon a verse of scripture and utter words that are known as Joseph Smith&#8217;s
First Prayer.<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>The heavens opened, and he received a visitation of God, the Father and His Son, Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Joseph did four things that became a spiritually directed process: 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">First</span>, he investigated, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">second</span>
he studied, <span style="text-decoration: underline">third</span> he pondered and 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">fourth</span>, he inquired through prayer. His diligence brought forth
the single most significant event in this dispensation. What is learned from Joseph&#8217;s experience
is to the benefit of all of mankind. </p>
<p>There are requirements to receiving spiritual guidance in our lives. We must be worthy of the
Gift of the Holy Ghost and exercise faith. We may not have the same manifestation as the young
boy prophet, but in worthiness we are entitled to personal revelation and answers to our prayers
offered in faith. Even divine intervention pertaining to our own circumstances. 
		<i>&#8220;But, behold, I
say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it
is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">feel</span> that it is
right&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 9:8, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&#160;It is important to remember that the Holy Ghost communes through our feelings and spiritual
impressions. We must treasure with reverence this special gift. <i>&#8220;But if it be not right you shall
have no such <span style="text-decoration: underline">feelings</span>, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the
thing which is wrong;&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 9:9, emphasis added).</p>
<p>President Hinckley explains it this way:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit&#8212;that which
enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and
uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of
the Spirit of God</i> (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, 261).</p>
<p>You have enrolled at this magnificent institution of higher learning. It provides a proper
atmosphere to study, work and gain experience that when completed, will prepare you to
prayerfully pursue opportunities that come to you in the years ahead. Because of the important
decisions that are before you, both in temporal affairs and things of the Spirit, it will be crucial to
know what the Lord would have you do.</p>
<p>Quite truthfully, it doesn&#8217;t seem that long ago that I too had hair and was at a university
studying, working, dating, worrying about finals and my course of study and my future in
general. I had served a mission, spent time in the Army and was finally approaching graduation,
unfortunately, in a field that no longer held my interest. I was confused and not sure what I
should do. A friend at work told me that he had accepted a job with a major Auto Manufacturer
in Detroit. I surprised myself by asking him to inquire if they were accepting other applications
for employment and if possible to send me an application. He did. I filled it out, sent it in and
was called for an interview. </p>
<p>During the interviewing process, I felt an unusual peace and confidence in hoping that my minor
in business would be sufficient in place of an unrelated major. I was hired! It seemed they were
more interested in personal integrity than educational prowess. This was not a career path that I
would have chosen, or even thought of, without divine intervention. The Lord knew what was
best for me when I did not. He knew where I could best serve in the Kingdom and where I would
learn to rely more on the power of the Holy Ghost .</p>
<p>The story does not end there, however. Some 32 years later after many moves, enjoyable
experiences and golden opportunities, I was surprised to be called in for what became my final
interview with the company. Rumor was that top management in our Division would be asked to
voluntarily retire early, due to reorganization efforts. Apprehensive of what this would mean to
my family, with children on missions and some still in college, I decided that I could not end my
employment at that time. As the interview approached, I was ready with the reasons why I could
not accept their offer of an early out (as it was called). But once again the spirit was very strong
and I was filled with a familiar peace that was over whelming&#8212;I knew that everything would be
okay and I accepted their offer. Doctrine and Covenants 6:23 reads: <i>&#8220;Did I not speak peace to
your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?&#8221; 
		</i></p>
<p>Only a few weeks later, I was invited to yet another interview by an Apostle of the Lord. This
interview resulted in a call to serve as mission president. T<span style="text-decoration: underline">ruly the Lord knows the end from the
beginning</span>.</p>
<p>As we prepare for a profession or the choice of an eternal companion or the direction of our life
in the future, it is imperative that we do so under the influence of personal revelation and
spiritual promptings. And truly our ultimate goal in this life is to prepare to meet God and
achieve the promise of exaltation and eternal life, the greatest of all gifts. All else is ancillary to
that goal.<span style="font-weight: bold">&#160;</span></p>
<p>This is a new semester, a new beginning, if you will. What better time to seek for guidance by
following the counsel of God&#8217;s appointed leaders. This past general conference we had the
opportunity to listen to counsel from Apostles and Prophets, general authorities and other general
officers of the Church. They spoke plainly the words the Lord would have us hear. By the power
of the Holy Ghost, they gave warnings, counsel and direction. </p>
<p>I love their messages. I love to associate with them and call them my friends. As a body of
saints, we should emulate them, follow their example&#8212;these are not miserable men who bear
testimony of the divinity of the Savior and truthfulness of the gospel. They have a joy and peace
that passeth all understanding. They are loved of the Lord.</p>
<p>In listening to their counsel, I&#8217;m sure that you have noticed we live in perilous times, both
spiritually and temporally. Reference to this fact was mentioned in each session. It is advisable
that we read every talk again in the May Ensign or listen to a rebroadcast and write down the
spiritual promptings we receive while hearing the literal voices of warning.</p>
<p>While living in Asia during the mid 1990&#8217;s, we became a little too familiar with &#8220;natural
disasters.&#8221; We experienced long, dark hours of a category 4 Typhoon (Hurricane in this
hemisphere). Small earthquakes at times were a weekly occurrence and flooding was common
during the monsoon season. Disease and pestilence also took on new meaning. Last December
26<sup>th</sup> I was again reminded of natural disasters and that these are perilous times while watching in
disbelief the Indian Ocean Tsunami with wave after wave of death and destruction, which
destroyed cities, families and lives.</p>
<p>A descriptive passage of scripture of the time in which we live is found in Paul&#8217;s second epistle
to Timothy. As we read, let us ask ourselves, &#8220;are any of the undesirable traits identified in these
verses found in me?&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
despisers of those that are good, </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away
		</i>(2 Timothy 3:1-5). </p>
<p>As foretold, we witness natural disasters and the iniquity of the natural man. There are many
voices calling from every direction, many things that vie for our time and attention. There is
much that is good and much that is bad. And bad among the good and good among the bad and
sometimes a blurry line between the two. It is easy to become confused unless we are: 
		</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">living to receive spiritual promptings and personal revelation.</span></p>
<p>It makes one ponder the tragedy of: The loss of a man&#8217;s life in a natural disaster&#8212;and&#8212; 
		</p>
<p>The disaster of the life that is lost to the natural man.</p>
<p>Two corollary scriptures explain:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and
will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit . . .  
		</i>(Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>Mormon explains further in Moroni 7: 13-15: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;
wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God,
and to serve him, is inspired of God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren that ye do not judge that which is evil
to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good
from evil; and the way to judge is as plain . . . as the daylight is from the dark
night.</i></p>
<p>Having been called to the newly formed Young Mens General Board gave me renewed
responsibility to review the materials available to the youth of the church. Please remember, to
me that should be anyone under 40 and maybe even over 40.</p>
<p>I read through the revised edition of the booklet, &#8220;For the Strength of Youth&#8221; Fulfilling Our Duty
to God, several times. I believe it should be renamed &#8220;For the Strength of the Saints.&#8221; It is based
on prophetic counsel and &#8220;inviteth and enticeth to do good continually.&#8221; 
		</p>
<p>You should remember this booklet from your days in the young men and young woman
programs. And according to one of my teenage Granddaughters: &#8220;The booklet I keep forgetting
to read.&#8221; </p>
<p>The table of contents list 17 topics that concisely remind us how we should conduct our
life&#8212;outlines of appropriate behavior in daily activities. These topics are designed to provide
information with clarity and eliminate possible youthful misunderstandings of gospel principles.
Also included are the documents for further enlightenment: &#8220;The Living Christ, The Testimonies
Of The Apostles&#8221; and a prophetic and clearly defined document called &#8220;The Family, A
Proclamation To The World&#8221; which clearly defines the roles of men and women. Inherent in this
pamphlet is that we must have a desire to keep focused on things that matter most.

<p>As a Bishop, Stake President, Mission President and General Authority, I conducted possibly
thousands of worthiness interviews of young and old, brand new and longtime members alike.
There were many times where even a small lack of understanding of true accountability to the
Lord, affected worthiness.</p>
<p>Let me list at a few of the topics with one or more lines from the text. As we read, let us
contemplate in our minds how we <span style="text-decoration: underline">understood</span> these topics in years now past, how we 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">understand</span>
them now and what changes we should make in our future.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;You have been given the Holy Ghost to help you know good from evil . . . you are being proven

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Dress and Appearance</span>: 
		</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Lowering your dress standards sends the message that you are using your body to get attention
and approval and that modesty is important only when convenient&#8221; </i>(Page 15).</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>I wish to comment that it is of great concern that we are falling prey to the escalating disregard
for modesty in dress and appearance. Reverence to Deity is shown by our appearance, grooming,
choice of clothing, actions and choice of words from our very lips. The world would have us
believe that our bodies are for ornamentation, experimentation, advertisement and gratification.
All are in direct opposition to the counsel we are given. </p>

addictive. What may begin as a curious indulgence can become a destructive
habit that takes control of your life. It can lead you to sexual transgression and
even criminal behavior. Pornography is a poison that weakens your self-control,
changes the way you see others, causes you to lose the guidance of the Spirit, and
can even affect your ability to have a normal relationship with your future spouse.
If you encounter pornography, turn away form it immediately</i> (Page 17-19).</p>
<p>I want to add some rather direct counsel given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks in his April general
conference address: We can&#8217;t warn enough on this subject! <i>&#8220;Patrons of pornography lose the

<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley gave more excellent counsel during the Priesthood Session of
General Conference on gambling&#8212;possibly a topic to be listed in the next &#8220;For The Strength of
Youth.&#8221; This practice is very popular on high school and college campuses to the extent that is
becoming a favorite activity.</p>

it an intensity that actually shows on the faces of those who are playing. And in
all too many cases, this practice, which appears innocent, can lead to an actual
addiction. The Church has been and is now opposed to this practice. If you have
never been involved in poker games or other forms of gambling, don&#8217;t start. If you
are involved then quit now while you can do so</i> (Ensign, April 2005).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about,
seeking whom he may devour:&#8221; </i>(1 Peter 5:8).</p>
<p>These vices are not new, they have existed since the beginning of recorded history. But in these
last days, the adversarial onslaught is cunning and relentless. No deception or denial or cleverly
crafted lie on our part can take us beyond the watchful eye of our Savior and Redeemer&#8212;We are
His&#8212;He bought us with a price&#8212;He knows of our doings. His Prophets warn to remove all
misconceptions. But all too often, when Prophets give counsel, those who need it most
rationalize themselves into thinking that the counsel does not apply to them.</p>

<p>Remember the direction given to the Prophet Joseph Smith while incarcerated in Liberty jail as

<p>Needless to say, we could spend hours discussing this passage of scripture, but if you can only
remember one phrase, let it be:<i> &#8220;that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled
only upon the principles of righteousness&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 121:36).</p>
<p>The priesthood in its greatest manifestation of power is directed by spiritual revelation. I have
been a participant and a receiver of such and testify of that power. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, some may still contend with statements such as: &#8220;Everybody should just lighten
up and relax. I  need some time to find myself! I just want to live life to its fullest, do it all! I
want to have some fun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me from my vantage point of life and experience explain what fun 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">really and truly is</span>: </p>
<p>Fun is looking back into the rearview mirror of your life and seeing behind you miles of
accomplishment with a few tight turns of challenge curving into a straightaway of blessings
down a peaceful road less traveled.</p>
<p>And if you are seeking to find yourself&#8212;the Lord already knows where and who you are. Seek
His guidance for He also knows who you can become.</p>
<p>My young friends, lest I have painted a gloomy picture of our earthly existence in these last
days, remember that we shouted for joy in the preexistent realms for the opportunity to gain a
body and prove ourselves herewith. A marvelous and exciting life awaits you. It will be
enhanced time and time again as you learn to hear and follow the spiritual voices and tune out
those that would distance you from the Spirit.<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>And pray continually for the ability to know the
difference.</p>
<p>Now, I want to share with you another cute face from our family&#8212;the latest in our lineup of
extraordinary grandchildren. Fresh and clean and pure, this sprightly little spirit typifies the word
angel in every sense. She literally has her Grandpa wrapped around that precious, extended little
finger. I am assured that as she entered this earthly existence, she had no doubts about enjoying
life, living worthily, having fun and returning to her Father in Heaven at the appointed time. She
has such excitement for each new day and spends most of it with that same expression you see
on the screen. She seems thoroughly convinced that this is the greatest experience possible.</p>
<p>She just started to crawl and explore her new world and we are quick to go ahead of her and
remove anything dangerous in her path. Oh, that I as her grandfather, could do that for her the
rest of her life.</p>
<p>I leave you my testimony of the divinity of the Savior, that He lives. In the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</p>

<p>My dear Brothers and Sisters, it is extremely humbling and yet exciting to stand here today in
this devotional setting. I am deeply honored that I would even be considered to speak to you and
to let you know of my love for you and my love for the Lord. </p>
<p>I want you to know, too, that I have prayed and fasted much concerning what I am to say to you
here today. I hope that you have prayed to so that the spirit of the Lord will be here and we will
all be edified together. And I&#8217;m glad to see that you have brought your scriptures with you
because I intend to use them as well.</p>
<p>The scriptures teach, <i>&#8220;men are, that they might have joy&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 2:25). I have pondered that
scripture for most of my life! I have always felt that men should have joy. But you sisters should
know that that verse pertains to you as well!</p>
<p>So what does it mean to have joy? I hope you will forgive some personal experiences from my
life, but they are the ones that seem to teach the greatest lessons.</p>
<p>My father and mother were attending BYU when they fell in love and were sealed in the Manti
Temple. They were blessed to have six beautiful children! Okay, five beautiful children and one
really intelligent one. They taught their 3 sons and 3 daughters the precepts of the gospel by both
word and example. As each child grew in stature and testimony, all 6 of them became worthy to
go to the temple and to be called to serve the Lord on missions throughout the world.</p>
<p>I, like Nephi, was truly born of goodly parents. They taught me to be happy. But I think one of
the happiest moments of my life was to finally graduate from high school. Because of a
promotion for my father, our family moved from San Diego to Los Angeles. I ended up going to
three different high schools in my senior year. In my last high school, the school officials
weren&#8217;t even sure I was going to graduate because of the differences in requirements. All I knew
is that I had purchased my cap and gown and I was walking in that graduation, with or without
their approval! I did get their approval and I did graduate. And I was so happy! 
		</p>
<p>The reason why I was so happy was because now I could go on my mission! I couldn&#8217;t wait to
serve the Lord on a mission. I went to South America, the Kentucky-Tennessee Mission. That&#8217;s
south in America . . . Deep South. I even learned a new language! I loved serving the Lord and
those good people there. I never knew a happier time in my entire life than teaching the gospel
all the time! I knew that the mission was to last two years, and then I would graduate that part of
my life and return home to be with my family. Again, although sad to leave those good people of
my mission, I was very happy to hop on that plane and arrive at the Los Angeles International
Airport. The plane arrived nearly a half an hour ahead of schedule. My heart could hardly
contain itself as I waited for my turn to walk off the airplane and have that joyous reunion with
my loved ones! When I walked into the terminal, there was no one there to greet me!!! I was too
early! When I finally saw my family running into the terminal and being able to hug them all, I
felt as Alma, the younger, meeting up with the sons of Mosiah after their wonderful mission
experience. This had to be true JOY!!</p>
<p>After a short time at home, my father and I (mostly my father) decided that it was time for me to
pursue another chapter in my search for happiness. So I left home for the happy hunting grounds
of BYU in pursuit of an education . . . okay, an eternal companion. I must mention here that at
that time there was somewhere around 28,000 students in attendance there. Even with that many
people around, I never felt so alone in all my life. Was this joy? I knew that the Gospel was true
and I continued to follow the spirit the best I could. And I found joy in serving in serving in
church. </p>
<p>I found a good paying job that helped me buy a brand new car! This was joy!!! So I thought! I
continued to be happy, even though I had not yet found &#8220;the one&#8221;! I was so happy, in fact, that I
bought a license plate holder for my new car that expressed my joy. It read &#8220;Happiness is being
Single&#8221;.</p>
<p>The path I was traveling soon took me back home again. It was there that my license plate holder
had been seen by a member of my Stake Presidency. He extended a thorough interview and after
signing my temple recommend said there could only be one other piece of paper that would be
more valuable and bring more joy than the one he had just signed . . . that would be the one for
the living ordinance . . . meaning getting sealed in the temple. And to help me with this search
for &#8220;joy&#8221;, he would set up a series of interviews over the next six months. In the first two
months, I was to report to him with a list of ten young women and their finest attributes. The
following two months I would narrow that list down to three, and then the last two months I
would narrow the list to one . . . and he said, &#8220;You can tell her before you tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to him, I had started dating a young lady that was soon to be my bride! After six
weeks of intensive dating and car repairs . . . a whole other story . . . we were engaged to be
married, and I had to call that counselor in the stake presidency and cancel my interviews with
him. I now knew what joy was! I had fasted and prayed many days, even been to the temple, and
it had been confirmed to me that she was the one I was to marry!!! I only hoped that she had
experienced the same feelings!! You see, she was waiting for a missionary . . . had been for
nearly 18 months . . . just the wrong missionary!!! I convinced her that she deserved the best!!!
So after another long six weeks of waiting and preparation, we were sealed in the Los Angeles
Temple. Truly, this was joy!!! What could possibly bring more joy than this?</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before I found out I was to be a dad. More joy? You bet!! Our little family started
coming . . . first a daughter, then a son, then another daughter, then another son! It was just like
ordering out of the Sears catalog! We were blessed beyond measure, and our joy was full!!
We&#8217;ve watched our children grow and develop their own testimonies of the gospel. We&#8217;ve
watched them make choices and learn the consequences of those choices. We&#8217;ve laughed
together when times have been good, cried together when things have been bad. We&#8217;ve also
learned how different each one of them was from each other. Our two oldest children have both
served missions and have chosen, not only to marry wonderful companions, but to be sealed to
them in the holy temple. They now even have children of their own . . . yes, I&#8217;m a grandpa!! If
you think being a mom or dad is great, just you wait!!! When my first grandchild arrived, I could
hardly contain myself! I had to call my folks and let them know of the joy of this new arrival.
They asked how it felt to be a grandpa. I guess it made me feel a little old . . . not any less happy,
that&#8217;s for sure! Then I teased my dad, &#8220;How does it feel to be a great grandpa?&#8221; He replied,
without any hesitation, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been a great grandpa!&#8221;</p>
<p>As I think about the joy and happiness I have felt throughout my life, I&#8217;ve often wondered what
has made my life different than anyone else that has been single and happy, married and happy,
had children and grandchildren and been happy?</p>
<p>Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, quoting the Prophet Joseph Smith, said: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if
we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness,
faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . </i>(A)<i>s God has designed our happiness &#8211; and the happiness of all His
creatures, He never has &#8211; He never will institute an ordinance or give a
commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that
happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount
of good and glory to those who become the recipients of His law and ordinances</i>.</p>
<p>George Q Cannon wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Whence comes your enjoyment? Whence come the glorious feelings that you have
when you feel the best? Do they come from the outside? Do external
circumstances produce real happiness of the kind that I describe? Doubtless, they
contribute to happiness; but the purist joy, the greatest happiness, that which is
most heavenly proceeds from within. A man must carry the principles of
happiness and the love of God in his own heart or he will not be happy</i>.</p>
<p>Do you get the feeling that if we are to be happy, it is up to us? And depending on how really
happy we are depends upon our faith and obedience to the commandments?</p>
<p>President David O. McKay said, <i>&#8220;The first condition of happiness is a clear conscience. No man
who does wrong or who is unvirtuous will be happy . . .</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Turn with me in your scriptures to the great conversion story of Alma the younger. If you will
remember, he and several of the sons of Mosiah were going all over the place with a mission to
destroy the church. It seems that Alma the elder had done all that he could possibly do to stop
them, but found that he could do nothing more except to pray and leave it in the hands of the
Lord. The Lord heard the prayers of Alma and sent an angel to help persuade Alma the Younger
to do the right thing. The angel gave Alma the younger a choice &#8211; to remember the good things
that the Lord had done for him and to repent and join back with the church, or he would be cast
off and destroyed! I don't know about you, but if an angel appeared to me and gave me a choice,
I think I would go with the better part! Especially if it meant obtaining more joy in my life. In
the 36<sup>th</sup> chapter of Alma, we find Alma the younger recounting and testifying of his wonderful
conversion to his son, Helaman. Starting with the 16<sup>th</sup> verse we read: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of
a damned soul.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was thus
harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have
heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus
Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus,
thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am
encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I
was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled
with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter
as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand,
there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy </i>(Alma 36: 16-21). 
		</p>
<p>Then as we look over to verse 24:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I
might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the
exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be
filled with the Holy Ghost</i> (Alma 36: 24).</p>
<p>As we realize the difference between true happiness and pleasure, we begin to realize what
Alma, the younger meant when he said, <i>&#8220;Wickedness never was happiness&#8221;</i> (Alma 41:10).</p>
<p>True happiness and joy is conditional upon our obedience to the commandments. The fact that
we are striving to be as obedient as we can, and working hard on being the best that we can, does
not necessarily mean that we will be free from trials and discouragement. Sometimes those trials,
or what I like to call challenges, help to teach us things about ourselves that we would never
learn unless we were faced with them. Those challenges may test our deepest faith. They may
teach us that the Lord is closer than we could ever imagine, or we may hear &#8220;Old Scratch&#8221; telling
us that it&#8217;s okay to do our own thing. </p>
<p>If we listen to the adversary, we will find ourselves drifting in the opposite direction that the
Lord would want us to go and our search for joy will be interrupted. The Lord may take a step or
two back and let us make our own decisions, and let the consequences follow. If we continue to
follow Satan, the spirit of the Lord will continue to withdraw from us and we will be left to fend
for ourselves. We will lose our footings on that firm foundation and our grasp on the iron rod
will be lost. Even if it is only for a moment, we may find ourselves wandering away from that
path which is just and right and true, and our joy will begin to disappear. If we don&#8217;t realize
quickly what is happening, and turn back to that iron rod, we might find ourselves drifting
further and further away, with the possibility of never recognizing how far away we really are
and the chance of never finding our way back.</p>
<p>Satan has a way of clouding our minds and encouraging us to do things we would not normally
do! He may even get us to believe that we are too far away from that rod, our joy is lost, and we
might as well give up and not even try to return. This is one of Satan&#8217;s greatest tools. If he can
deceive us, get us discouraged and get us to go as far away from the gospel as he can, then he
feels a great victory. The less joy he can get you to feel, the happier he is.</p>
<p>As a bishop, I have had many opportunities to work with those that have seemed to have lost that
joy that we have been talking about. As a matter of fact, part of our ward boundaries includes the
local jail. I have had many chances to &#8220;teach the spirits in prison&#8221;. There is one example I would
like to share with you.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about a young lady who, even though she may have been raised in the church,
made some decisions and choices which took her away from the church. She found herself with
group of friends that did things that were not in keeping with the standards of the gospel. She
gave in to peer pressure and soon found herself doing the same things they were. 
		</p>
<p>She was arrested by the authorities and was sentenced to jail. She spent nearly 18 months
without any contact from her family or friends or even the church. While she was in jail, her
husband divorced her. Her son went with her ex-husband, and her daughter went to be raised
with her mother. Can you imagine what it must have been like to be all alone in that kind of
situation? Can you feel the loss of joy she must have experienced? You need to realize that in the
jail, there&#8217;s not a lot for you to do. The atmosphere is not necessarily conducive to the spirit of
the Lord. The feeling of joy does not abound there. Sometimes, when I visit, I feel the repentance
process in full swing. There are many there that have realized their mistakes and are paying the
price. Knowing that in order to have a fullness of joy, they need to repent for breaking those
laws. There are others that feel no remorse and as soon as they are out, they will probably do the
same thing all over again!</p>
<p>This young lady was beginning to understand what repentance was all about. She sensed the lack
of joy and happiness all around her. She was willing to accept the consequences of her choices.
When I was given the opportunity to meet with her and to feel of her spirit, much repentance had
been made. She told me that she wasn&#8217;t even sure whether she was still a member of the church
or not or if she could ever come back to the church. She did know that whether she was a
member or not, she could still pray. She found herself praying for changes in her life. Her heart
had softened. Even in jail, she was responding to the whisperings of the spirit. The Lord was
answering her prayers, too, even though she was still having a hard time feeling the spirit. 
		</p>
<p>She had been sentenced to serve out a term that included hard time in a federal prison up north,
but by some divine intervention, rather than going to the State Pen, she was transferred here to
do some of that time. She didn&#8217;t know exactly why the transfer was changed, but the Lord knew!
It just so happens that her mother, who had been taking care of her daughter &#8211; her granddaughter
&#8211; live close to this area, and they now have the opportunity of visiting her each week. Think of
the great joy it must have been for her to see them both after such a long time of being alone. She
mentioned how grateful she was to the Lord and His great blessing in sending her here to be with
her family. I felt blessed to be able to visit her and to see some of the joy of the gospel come
back into her heart. I wish I could say that she lived happily ever after and is now serving as a
Relief Society President in some ward, but the story isn&#8217;t over yet. She still must pay the rest of
her debt to society, but there is hope and joy that will come to her as she strives to be obedient to
the commandments. That is a promise that He gives to all of us. And I have never known the
Lord to ever renegotiate on His promises!</p>
<p>The most wonderful part about this great Plan of Happiness is the opportunity we have of
making the Savior&#8217;s atonement effective in our own lives. We know it is there, and may know it
works for others, but we must realize that it is there for each one of us on a personal basis. All
we need to do is the best we can, and then look to Him for the extra help we may need!</p>
<p>Listen to what James E. Talmage has said on this subject:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Happiness leaves no bad after-taste, it is followed by no depressing reaction; it
calls for no repentance, brings no regret, entails no remorse; pleasure too often
makes necessary repentance, contrition, and suffering; and, if indulged to the
extreme, it brings degradation and destruction.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>True happiness is lived over and over again in memory, always with a renewal of
the original good; a moment of unholy pleasure may leave a barbed sting, which,
like a thorn in the flesh, is an ever present source of anguish.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Happiness is not akin with levity, nor is it one with light-minded mirth. It springs
from the deeper fountains of the soul, and is not infrequently accompanied by
tears. Have you never been so happy that you have had to weep? I have.</i></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I felt that way not long ago as we waited in the sealing room of the Idaho
Falls Temple. A young couple came into that room all dressed in white. You could sense the joy
and happiness they felt just by looking at their countenances. After some inspired instruction by
one who had been called, set apart and given keys to perform these eternal ordinances, they were
sealed for time and all eternity. That in itself would have brought great joy to any couple! But
what brought even greater joy to them and to all of us was when the door was opened again, and
their children, all dressed in white, filed quietly into the room. They knelt beside their parents
and were sealed to them forever. Words cannot express the joy and happiness that we all felt. 
		</p>
<p>So how do we achieve true happiness? Is it a place we can go? Can we buy it in a store? What
does it take to get it and what does it take to keep it?</p>
<p>Some of you may remember the young actress, Shirley Temple. She starred in many movies, but
there is one particular movie called, &#8220;The Blue Bird of Happiness&#8221;. It&#8217;s a wonderful story of how
she goes in search for true happiness. She searches everywhere, but her search leads her right
back to her own home. She realized that the Blue Bird of Happiness was in her own heart! That,
my good brothers and sisters is where we can find true happiness . . . right in our own hearts!</p>
<p>Some seventy years after the Savior had visited the people in America, Mormon tells us in 4<sup>th</sup> 
Nephi chapter 1 verses 15 and 16:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love
of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings,
nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a
happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i></p>
<p>How do we become like that? Turn again with me in your scriptures to Alma chapter 48 and let&#8217;s
read about Captain Moroni. </p>
<p>Starting with verse 11:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of perfect
understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul
did joy in the liberty and freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage
and slavery;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many
privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor
exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, . . . 
		</i>(Alma 48: 11-13).</p>
<p>And now if you&#8217;ll jump over to verse 17: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would
be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken
forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of
men </i>(Alma 48: 17)<i>.</i></p>
<p>Even in his young age Moroni was prepared to serve the Lord and put Satan in his place &#8211; as far
away from him as he possibly could! His heart was right!</p>
<p>Young people, you live in the most chosen time of any in the scriptures! You are preparing to
usher in the Second coming of the Lord! Could you possibly live in a happier time?!? I tell the
young men in my ward that they are my Helaman&#8217;s Warriors. They are arming themselves with
the sword of the spirit and the breastplate of righteousness. They are doing things now that are
preparing them to be at the front of that great army that will help to usher in the 2<sup>nd</sup> coming of the
Savior. You young men here today can also be part of that great army if you will prepare
yourselves! Remember, &#8220;If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.&#8221; You young women can be a
tremendous influence for good! I know we talk much of Helaman&#8217;s Warriors, but it was their
mothers that deserve most of the credit. No matter what your calling is in this life, be sure that
your heart is right with the Lord and you will find that true joy that is promised in the scriptures.</p>
<p>How grateful I am to be alive in this day and age, to see each of you stand a little taller, be a little
better, do a little more for your spouse or room mates; when all around us, so many seem to be
getting away with a little more, being a little more dishonest, doing a little more to annoy your
spouse or room mates, making it harder to feel the spirit.</p>
<p>If you want real joy and happiness in your own life, raise your own bar. Make those decisions
that will bring you closer to Him. Pray a little more. Study a little harder. Bear your testimony a
little more often. Brethren, use your priesthood righteously more often. Go to the temple more
often. Prove to yourself that the Lord will bless you with increased joy and happiness. Don&#8217;t do
it for anyone else but you! Don&#8217;t deceive yourself into believing that when something special
happens; when you get your new car, when you finally find &#8220;the one&#8221;, when you get your
degree, when you have children or grandchildren, when you remodel the house, then you will be
happy . . . be obedient to His commandments and feel that great joy in your life now!</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 18:15 we read, <i>&#8220;And if it so be that you should labor all your days . .
. and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of
my Father!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>But if you haven&#8217;t saved your own soul, where will your joy be?</p>
<p>I want you to know that happiness is being married to the same wonderful woman I fell in love
with over 28 years ago. I love her. Happiness is having children that love the gospel, because
they want to, not because you want them to. I love them too. Happiness is having grandchildren!
Do I have to tell you that I love them too? I do! Happiness is knowing that the sealing powers are
eternal. Happiness is doing the right thing, for the right reason, even if you don&#8217;t want to. True
happiness and joy begins in our hearts as we strive to keep the commandments the very best that
we can. That is when we find true joy!!</p>
<p>I bear you my witness of the truthfulness of this gospel. It is God&#8217;s Plan of Happiness. I testify
that we will only be truly happy if our will comes in line with the Father&#8217;s will. If we will choose
wisely. I testify that as we do choose wisely, the spirit will speak peace to our souls. And in a
world where peace is hard to find, we will find the true rest that the scriptures talk about. I testify
that our Heavenly Father lives and loves us. He hears and answers our prayers. He loves you and
knows you by name! He would love nothing more than to bless you with that Eternal Joy that
only He can bless you with, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Diane and I are thrilled to be in Rexburg and to be edified by the spirit of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. Thank
you for your kindness and gracious hospitality and for what you will teach us during our brief
time with you.</p>
<p>I was born in Hawaii when it was a territory of the United States, ten years before statehood.
Raised in the islands in a multi-cultural environment, I left for higher education on the U.S.
mainland and a mission to England, and after marriage to a Canadian girl, returned to Hawaii to
raise our family.</p>
<p>My father first went to Hawaii in 1940 as a young missionary for the Church. He personally
witnessed the events of December 7, 1941 when the U.S. was violently drawn into war by the
attack on Pearl Harbor. He served three years as a missionary, went home to Salt Lake City, and
joined the Army. After boot camp and Officer Candidate School, he was stationed back in
Hawaii. I assume his knowledge of the islands and his fluent Hawaiian language skills
influenced that decision. On leave the next year, 1944, he went back to Salt Lake and married
my mother whom he knew from his university days prior to his mission. They spent the
remainder of the war on Oahu. In 1945, they returned to Salt Lake City, stayed nine months, and
returned to Hawaii to live. My mother has passed away, but my father still lives there, now
nearly 65 years since he first arrived. We love the uniqueness, the diversity, and the culture of
the islands. In Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p>
<p>Five years ago, after receiving a call to my current position, we were assigned to the Asia North
Area, supervising the Church in Japan and South Korea, and doing humanitarian work in North
Korea for three years. After two years at Church headquarters, we will leave this summer to
serve in another international assignment involving 23 different countries.</p>
<p>With this growing perspective, heightened by the purpose of my ecclesiastical responsibilities, I
have spent much time pondering how the gospel is established in an individual life, in a family,
in a country, and indeed throughout the world. The words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph
Smith often come to my mind. <i>&#8220;Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the
foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine
and Covenants 64:33). </p>
<p>The Lord, of course, understands the process of developing a testimony, and of the combined
force of sincere and righteous people necessary to build His Church in any area of the world.</p>
<p>There are two ways the Church grows: (1) by converts, of which there are hundreds of thousands
each year; and (2) multi-generationally, with children following the example of member parents.
Both are essential to the future of the Lord&#8217;s kingdom and complement one another, as the
conversion of today is the multi-generational growth of tomorrow.</p>
<p>In this audience, we have first generation members of the Church; also, second generation, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, and even those who represent the seventh generation of Church membership
in this dispensation. For each of you first generation members there is a unique and significant
story of how you came to your current place of spiritual understanding and commitment. For the
rest of us, we have been blessed by the courage and humility of righteous ancestors who
established a pattern for us to follow.</p>
<p>To amplify the doctrine that <i>&#8220;. . . out of small things proceedeth that which is great&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine
and Covenants 64:33) I tell you the story of Masako Kato. In 1951, when Masako was in her
early twenties, she met the missionaries in her hometown of Yokohama, Japan when she
attended an English conversation class being taught by them. When the missionaries began to
speak of spiritual things, she felt something and allowed them to begin teaching her about the
Church and the restored gospel. During this time, both Masako&#8217;s older sister and her mother
died, within 30 days of each another. She was emotionally devastated, but still attended the little
branch of our Church in the area; even the week after her mother passed away. When the
opening hymn was sung, the power of the Spirit brought her to tears and she understood for the
first time the eternal nature of life.</p>
<p>Masako wanted to be baptized, but her father would not give his permission. Although she was
of legal age, her respect for her father caused her to not proceed. However, she continued to
attend Church and participate like a member.</p>
<p>The missionaries suggested it would be good for her to share the glorious message she had come
to know. Seemingly unafraid, even though the Church had little presence in Japan in 1951, she
invited co-workers and even bosses at her company to come to Church with her. A few came to
some social activities; but one, Shozo Suzuki, a very new employee of the company, came to
Sunday meetings. He had a good feeling about what he heard and consented after a time to
receive the missionary discussions. Masako also joined in for her second time through the
lessons. After several months, Shozo accepted the challenge to be baptized. Masako again went
to her father to seek permission, which he then gave because of the devotion he witnessed in her.
On August 4, 1952, Shozo and Masako were baptized in the same service.</p>
<p>One day, a few months later, a young missionary approached Shozo and Masako and suggested
they think about marriage&#8212;to each other! This surprised them, especially Shozo as he had a
non-member girlfriend. However, it prompted him to think about Masako, the person who
introduced him to the gospel, in a different way than ever before. On April 29, 1953, they were
married in a civil hall in Tokyo by the mission president. In 1965, they came to the Hawaii
Temple to be sealed as there was no temple in Japan until 1980.</p>
<p>Brother and Sister Suzuki were blessed with nine children, six daughters and three sons. Seven
of their children served full-time missions for the Church. Of the nine, eight married, all in the
temple, and seven of their spouses served full-time missions. The Suzukis have 35
grandchildren, with all, eight years of age or older, having been baptized members of the Church.
Brother Suzuki has served as a branch president, district president, mission president, Japan
Missionary Training Center president, regional representative, and a patriarch in three stakes.
With the singular beginning of diminutive Masako (shown in the center of the photograph), and
now 54 righteous members of the Suzuki family, indeed <i>&#8220;. . . out of small things proceedeth that
which is great&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 64:33). </p>
<p>This same miracle is found everywhere in the world where the Church is established. It has
happened, or will happen, in your own family.</p>
<p>How does it happen? That question is answered in a companion verse to the one previously read.
		<i>&#8220;Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat
the good of the land of Zion in these the last days&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 64:34).</p>
<p>This doctrine is powerfully affirmed in the experience of Jesus with the Pharisitical lawyer who
asked him: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This is the first and great commandment</i> (Matthew 22:36-38).</p>
<p>So, from these and other prophetic words we understand that both the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">heart</span> and the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">mind</span> must be
fully engaged in this holy process. The conversion of our soul and the ongoing refinement of our
life, as we adopt the attributes of Godliness, is our earthly mission and is rewarded with 
		<i>&#8220;. . .
eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 14:7).</p>
<p>The heart is symbolic of love and commitment. Love is the most powerful motivator of all. We
will make sacrifices and bear burdens for those we love that we would not endure for any other
reason; not for money, not for recognition, not for power. If love does not exist, our commitment
will surely wane.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord with all our heart, we are willing to give Him everything we possess. Elder
Neal A. Maxwell said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The submission of one&#8217;s will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to
place on God&#8217;s altar . . . The many other things we give to God, however nice that
may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned
them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be
swallowed up in God&#8217;s will, then we are really giving something to Him . . . There
is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do
decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then
we&#8217;ve really given Him the one final thing He asks of us</i> (BYU January 12, 1999).</p>
<p>Having a &#8220;willing mind&#8221; connotes giving our best effort, our finest thinking, and seeking God&#8217;s
wisdom. It suggests that our most devoted lifetime study should be of things which are eternal in
nature. It says to me that there must be an inextricable relationship between hearing the word of
God and obeying it.</p>
<p>The first word in the Doctrine and Covenants is &#8220;hearken&#8221;. It appears repeatedly in this book of
scripture, which is a compilation of the <i>&#8220;. . . doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in
this dispensation&#8221; </i>(Preface to Doctrine and Covenants 1). The meaning of the word is even
explicitly given in Section 42. <i>&#8220;Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey the law which I
shall give unto you&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 42:2).</p>
<p>The Apostle James said in the same chapter as the sacred verse which was a catalyst to the boy
Joseph Smith before his profound experience in the Sacred Grove, <i>&#8220;But be ye doers of the word,
and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves&#8221;</i> (James 1:22).</p>
<p>Some of us &#8220;hear&#8221; selectively, and &#8220;do&#8221; when it is convenient. One whose &#8220;heart&#8221; and &#8220;mind&#8221;
are given to the Lord is consistent; whether the burden is light or heavy makes no difference.</p>
<p>As a part of one of my assignments at Church headquarters, I have been directly involved in the
making of a film honoring the life of Joseph Smith. This major production, to be shown in the
Legacy Theater of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is anticipated to be completed by the
end of this year&#8212;by the December 23<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of the Prophet&#8217;s birth. Recently, I was at the
Church&#8217;s Motion Picture Studio in Provo observing the filming of scenes portraying the
imprisonment of Joseph, his brother Hyrum, and others in the Liberty Jail.</p>
<p>Envision the setting&#8212;several innocent men incarcerated for months in the cramped, cold, filthy,
foul confines of this dungeon. More over his concern for the suffering Saints than for his own
safety and comfort, Joseph pleads with the Lord:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O God, where are thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from
the eternal heavens the wrong of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be
penetrated with their cries? </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions,
before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with
compassion toward them? </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all things that in
them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil . . . stretch forth thy hand;
let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be
covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels
moved with compassion toward us </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 121:1-4)<i>.</i></p>
<p>And then, the powerful, comforting words of the Lord: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 121:7-8).</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>In an epistle to the Saints written a few years later, it is clear Joseph has come to fully accept
God&#8217;s will for him:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small
thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days
of my life . . . God knoweth all these things, whether it be good or bad. But
nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become second
nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the
God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from
henceforth</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 127:2).</p>
<p>A consecrated heart and mind is demonstrated by consistency in following God&#8217;s
commandments no matter how difficult our earthly circumstances. President Gordon B. Hinckley
told the following story in 1982 in a general conference of the Church:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Later this month we shall dedicate a beautiful new building on the Brigham
Young University campus to the memory of a woman, Caroline Hemenway
Harman . . . At the age of twenty-two Caroline married George Harman. They
had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Then, at the age of thirty-nine,
her husband passed away and she was left a widow.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Her sister, Grace, had married her husband&#8217;s brother, David. In 1919, during the
terrible influenza epidemic, David was seriously stricken, and then his wife,
Grace, became ill. Caroline cared for them and their children as well as her own.
In the midst of these afflictions, Grace gave birth to a son, and then she died
within a few hours. Caroline took the tiny infant to her own home and there
nurtured it and saved the child&#8217;s life. Three weeks later her own daughter, Annie
passed away.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>By now Caroline had lost two of her own children, her husband, and her sister.
The strain was too much. She collapsed. She came out of that collapse with a
serious case of diabetes. But she did not slow down. She continued to care for her
sister&#8217;s baby; and her brother-in-law, the child&#8217;s father, came each day to see the
little boy. David Harman and Caroline were later married, and there were now
thirteen children in their home.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then five years later David suffered a catastrophe that tried to the very depths
those who agonized with him. On one occasion he used a strong disinfectant in
preparing seed for planting. This got on his body, and the effects were disastrous.
The skin and flesh sloughed off his bones. His tongue and teeth dropped out. The
caustic solution literally ate him alive.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Caroline nursed him in this terrible illness, and when he died she was left with
five of her own and eight of her sister&#8217;s children, and a farm of 280 acres where
she and the children plowed, sowed, irrigated, and harvested in preparing to
bring in enough to provide for their needs. At this time she was also Relief Society
president, a position she held for eighteen years.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>While caring for her large family and in extending the hand of charity to others,
she would bake eight loaves of bread a day and wash forty loads of clothes a
week. She canned fruits and vegetables by the ton, and cared for a thousand
laying hens to provide a little cash. Self-reliance was her standard. Idleness she
regarded as sin. She cared for her own and reached out to others in a spirit of
kindness that would permit no one of whom she was aware to go hungry,
unclothed, or cold.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>She later married Eugene Robison, who, not long afterward, suffered a stroke.

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Finally, exhausted, her body racked by the effects of diabetes, she passed away at
the age of sixty-seven. The habits of industry and hard work which she instilled in
her children rewarded their efforts through the years. Her sister&#8217;s tiny baby,
whom she nurtured from the hour of his birth, together with his brothers and
sisters, all acting out of a sense of love and gratitude, have given the university a
substantial bequest to make possible the beautiful building which will carry her
name </i>(Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference, April 14, 1982)<i>.</i></p>
<p>I wish to suggest five essential ways one can genuinely seek to give their heart and mind to the
Lord:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Gain and Constantly Nurture Your Own Testimony</span></p>
<p>A Latter-day Saint&#8217;s testimony should include a knowledge of, and love for, God the Father, the
Only Begotten Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. It would know of the glorious gospel plan and
the centrality of the Savior and His atonement. It would understand the <i>&#8220;marvelous work and the
wonder&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 27:26) of the restoration of the Lord&#8217;s Church in this last dispensation and the
role of apostles and prophets, from Joseph Smith to Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>
<p>If you do not feel the power and security that this knowledge brings, I ask you to study the
exhortation of Moroni, often quoted by the full-time missionaries of the Church, but not always
followed by investigators. We read:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God,
the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye
shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will
manifest the truth unto of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost </i>(Moroni
10:4).</p>
<p>Take note that there are three essential requirements: Faith in Christ; a sincere heart; and real
intent. Perhaps the least understood of these is &#8220;real intent&#8221;. In concert with the other conditions
to receiving an answer, real intent means you are willing to do as directed. Consequently, if you
are praying without a firm commitment to follow, it is unlikely that direction will come.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Honor Priesthood Ordinances and Covenants</span></p>
<p>To help us progress, God asks us to perform priesthood ordinances. Ordinances are sacred
ceremonies in which we make commitments to Him, and He confers upon us the potential to
receive the blessings of eternity. As covenant-children we have all that is required for eternal
success if we are true to our promises. Prepare for the ordinances yet to be performed in your life
and be guided in your life decisions by the covenants you have made. When you are evaluating
alternatives, ask yourself &#8220;Is this choice consistent with my covenants?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson recently said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this</i>&#8212;<i>if one does not
appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will
grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the
moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability
to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his
own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to
despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself </i>(CES Fireside
for Young Adults, November 7, 2004, BYU).</p>
<p>Follow the rallying cry of the early pioneers as they were organizing themselves for the
treacherous journey westward.<i> &#8220;And this shall be our covenant</i>&#8212;<i>that we will walk in all the
ordinances of the Lord&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Cevenants 136:4). </p>
<p>When we live by covenant and not convenience, our lives are directed toward our Heavenly
home.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Root-out Duplicity</span></p>
<p>Duplicity is acting one way in public and another way in private. The purpose of our deception is
to hide our sins; but, as Jonah learned when he fled to Joppa, you cannot hide from God. Even to
others, our deceit will be found out in time and the damage caused to those closest to us may be
irreversible.</p>
<p>One way to test whether we have <i>&#8220;an eye single to the glory of God&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
4:5) or a secondary eye to the evil of the world is to evaluate how we act when we are alone.
What sites do we visit on the Internet? What television programs or videos do we watch? What
kind of books and magazines do we read? Would we be comfortable in the same activities if
others were watching?</p>
<p>James taught, <i>&#8220;A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways&#8221;</i> (James 1:8). Our deceit will
affect every facet of our life, impairing our ability to progress in earthly and eternal
relationships.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Continually Study the Doctrine</span></p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer has said, <i>&#8220;The study of doctrine will change behavior more than the
study of behavior will change behavior.&#8221;</i> When we know the commandments of God from the
writings of the prophets and <i>&#8220;liken all scripture unto us, that it might be for our profit and
learning&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 19:23) it will change the way we think and act.</p>
<p>Studying and following the counsel of living prophets is vital. Having prophets of God on earth
has become so commonplace for us in this Church that their profound importance and role is
often woefully under appreciated.</p>
<p>Elder Henry B. Eyring stated: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with
strong faith. When a prophet speaks, those with little faith may think that they
hear only a wise man giving good advice. Then if his counsel seems comfortable
and reasonable, squaring with what they want to do, they take it. If it does not,
they consider it either faulty advice or they see their circumstances as justifying
their being an exception to the counsel.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Another fallacy is to believe that the choice to accept or not accept the counsel of
prophets is no more than deciding whether to accept good advice and gain its
benefits or to stay where we are. But the choice not to take prophetic counsel
changes the very ground upon which we stand. It becomes more dangerous</i>
(General Conference, April 1997).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Establish a Life of Service</span></p>
<p>The Lord simply stated <i>&#8220;If thou lovest me, thou shalt serve me . . .&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
42:29). Still in my twenties, I was called to be the bishop of an 850-member ward. Two weeks
prior, I, with a partner, founded a company that had just hired and was responsible for several
new employees. At the time, my wife and I had three active children ages one to seven. The
daunting responsibilities to properly care for my young family, the Saints entrusted to my
stewardship, and to create a viable business, seemed impossible.</p>
<p>As I now reflect on the events of the ensuing years, I am convinced that service to others, most
importantly to my family, has been one of the great blessings of my life. Without the continual
humility and life perspective that service engenders, the allure of the world could easily have
entrapped me.</p>
<p>Serving others emulates the ultimate act of service offered to each of us by the Redeemer of the
world. It is a way for us to make partial payment for the opportunity of salvation which comes
only through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Submitting our will&#8212;completely giving our heart and minds to God&#8212;is not easy. Is there
another way?</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was looking for a property in a valley above the city of Honolulu. I stopped
to look at a map and then glanced up to read the street sign. There it was; I found what many
spend their entire lives searching for. &#8220;Easy Street!&#8221; Right before me, the green and white sign
was enticing me to turn and follow. As I was musing on the moment, I looked at the pole upon
which the sign was mounted, and half way down a big yellow sign clearly announced &#8220;Dead
End.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is not another way. I would not want another way. I am comfortable with, and comforted
by, the <i>&#8220;great plan of happiness&#8221;</i> (Alma 42:8). I testify of He who&#8217;s plan it is, God the Eternal
Father; and He who is central to the plan, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. I witness of
apostles and prophets whose counsel I gladly follow. With all my heart and all my mind I
witness of these truths. They have made all the difference in my life.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for being here today. I&#8217;m grateful for that warm and personal welcome.
Students of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho: I am very humbled and happy to address you. For over forty years, my
wife and I have been blessed by the full life of the mind offered by involvement with Church
Education, first as we were students at Brigham Young University in Provo, and as we, for many
years, have both served on the faculty. She and I met in the library, and were married in the
Idaho Falls Temple 36 happy years ago. So, we hope you will go to the library and that good
things will happen there. </p>
<p>Actually, Sister Welch is an Idaho girl, a descendant of Idaho colonizer and apostle Charles C.
Rich. She grew up in Burley before going to study in Paris (France, that is). My own ancestors
on my mother&#8217;s side are Hatches and Woodlands, who settled in Franklin and near Downey,
Idaho; and my father was born in Jerome, while his father was working as a research agronomist
in the Idaho state department of agriculture. So, we, too, are happy to sing, &#8220;And Here We Have
Idaho.&#8221; </p>
<p>For over 25 years now I have taught at BYU and have been involved with scriptural research and
Mormon studies, for which I am very grateful.  During this time I have served in student wards
and stakes. My wife and I love teaching the youth of the Church. We know of your goodness,
your testimonies, and your deep commitment to the gospel; we also know of your challenges and
struggles. We encourage you to think clearly, to be wise, and be not deceived.
		</p>
<p>I thank each of you for coming and bringing&#8212;not just your scriptures&#8212;but also the Holy Ghost
with you. You may remember Brigham Young&#8217;s instruction to the original BYU faculty that they
should not teach even the multiplication tables without the Holy Ghost. There&#8217;s a crucial
corollary to that instruction: As students, you should not <i>learn</i> even the multiplication tables
without the Holy Ghost. It does the faculty little good to <i>teach</i> with the Holy Ghost if you aren&#8217;t
out there ready to <i>receive</i> with the Holy Ghost. I pray that you will listen attentively, and that
what I say may sink into your memory, so that the Holy Ghost may call these words back to your
memory in the moment in which you might need them. </p>
<p>Today, my talk is about loving God with your mind. When I began thinking about this topic two
years ago, I was surprised to find that the topic of loving God with the mind has not been
discussed very often. So, perhaps this subject will strike you as new and, I hope, will be
stimulating and thought-provoking. I feel what it means to love God with my heart and soul, but
what does it mean to love him with your mind? As I have asked this question to several people, I
get several different answers. How would you answer this question?</p>
<p>At the outset, let&#8217;s turn to a passage in Mark, chapter 12, which I find terribly important. You
may remember it. It begins with verse 28. A highly educated scribe, who had overheard Jesus
reasoning with some Sadducees, approached the Savior and asked, <i>&#8220;. . .which is the first
commandment of all?&#8221; </i>(Mark 12:28). Jesus answered, &#8220;<i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. . .</i>&#8221; (Mark
12:30). And giving the scribe a bonus he hadn&#8217;t asked for, Jesus added: &#8220;<i>And this is the second,
Love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no commandment greater than these&#8221; 
		</i>(paraphrased from
Mark 12:31). To which the scholar responded, &#8220;<i>Teacher, you speak very well and in truth, for to
love God with all of one&#8217;s heart and with all one&#8217;s understanding and with all one&#8217;s strength,
and to love one&#8217;s neighbor as oneself is more advantageous than all burnt offerings and
sacrifice</i>&#8221; (paraphrased fom Mark 12:32-33). Seeing that this person spoke discreetly (which in
Greek means &#8220;with discretion or intelligence), Jesus said, <i>&#8220;. . .Thou are not far from the kingdom
of God. . .&#8221; </i>(Mark 12:34).<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>Many things about this brief encounter should be deeply interesting to us. Since Jesus was
dealing here with a scribe, a craftsman of words, let me mention its notable vocabulary. When
Jesus stated the prime commandment, he carefully included the mind. The Greek word used in
Mark 12:30 for &#8220;mind&#8221; is <i>dianoia,</i> richly meaning to love God thoroughly (<i>dia-</i>) with all your
way of thinking and understanding (-<i>noia</i>). When the scholar answered, he used an even more
dynamic word, namely <i>synesis,</i> meaning the holding of things together, of comprehensive
comprehension, synthesis, and insight. And then, escalating a third step, Jesus told this man that
he was not far from the kingdom because he spoke <i>nounechos,</i> literally &#8220;having 
		<i>vous,&#8221; </i>the
highest term in the Greek philosophical pantheon for true, even divine, intelligence. All three of
these words in Mark 12, <i>dianoia, synesis</i> and <i>nounechos</i>, highly regard the mind, the last being
especially strong. </p>
<p>How many lessons can we draw from this exchange between the Savior and this educated scribe
who had devoted his life to the learning of words, texts, and ideas? Consider with me seven
dimensions of loving God with our all our mind. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1. This scripture tells us it is possible. 
		</span>We learn here with assurance that it is <i>possible</i> to get
near to the kingdom of God <i>with our intelligence intact.</i> This smart man was close to the mark,
and Jesus congratulated him for it. </p>
<p>Likewise, your faculty here at BYU-Idaho congratulates and encourages you. At this institution
and in this religion, I assure you, you don&#8217;t need to check your brains at the door. To be a
gospel-scholar, you&#8217;ll need all the brilliance you can muster, for we have the double challenge of
knowing not only the ways of the world but also the ways of the Lord, and then, getting the two
together. In this sense, the world actually has the lighter assignment, at least by half. Of course,
in another sense, our task is the easier. Because we have the scriptures and temple of the
Restoration, we have more pieces of the puzzle, as well as the advantage of the picture on the
box.</p>
<p>In your building years, you have the opportunity to make BYU-Idaho the preeminent place
where God is loved with all the mind. I hope you are excited and humbled to be a university
student in this LDS community. Latter-day Saints boldly affirm that intelligence is the glory of
God (Doctrine and Covenants 93) and that <i>&#8220;to be learned is good&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 9:29) so long as we
avoid the vainness, frailties and foolishness of the world, and <i>&#8220;hearken 
		</i>[instead] <i>unto the
counsels of God,&#8221; </i>as Jacob taught in 2 Nephi 9. </p>
<p>Have you thought of ancient and modern prophets who offer role models of highly intelligent
people who have loved the Lord with their minds? Isaiah was an amazingly brilliant writer. Paul,
both before and after his conversion, was clearly one of the most educated people of his day.
Alma, with profound articulation, went head on against the stubborn issues of his day. I
understand that until only recently, President Hinckley has enjoyed reading the Classics in Latin
and Greek, which he learned in college. It may not be easy, but as Ammon promised the people
of Limhi in Mosiah 7, <i>&#8220;if ye will serve </i>[the Lord] <i>
<span style="font-weight: bold">with all diligence of mind </span>. . . he will . . .
deliver you&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 7:33, emphasis added). This indeed is possible.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Notice that we&#8217;re dealing here with a commandment. 
		</span>The words of Jesus make it clear that
we are <i>commanded</i> to love God with our mind. Pondering this, I wondered:  Do I think of
keeping this commandment when I partake of the sacrament? Do you think of it when you
answer the recommend question about earnestly striving to keep the commandments? 
		</p>
<p>Like keeping any commandment, this will surely take conscious effort. We don&#8217;t keep the Word
of Wisdom by accident. We don&#8217;t keep the Sabbath day without planning and devotion. So, I
ask, What do you do to keep this commandment deliberately? Do you earnestly strive to love
God with all your mind? I doubt that a flimsy, &#8220;well, I guess so,&#8221; is going to be good enough.
Jacob exhorted the Nephites to <i>&#8220;look unto God with firmness of mind&#8221; 
		</i>(Jacob 3:1). And Alma
made it clear that God will reveal his mysteries only <i>&#8220;according to the heed and diligence&#8221; 
		</i>we
give unto him (Alma 12:9). </p>
<p>So what might you do to keep this commandment more diligently and deliberately? For starters,
do you begin your scripture study with a prayer of loving gratitude? Might you take better notes
and keep better files on important thoughts you wish to retain eternally? You might find
publications like <i>BYU Studies</i> helpful in strengthening both your mind and testimony.</p>
<p>Also, you might wonder, how can we be commanded to love God? Isn&#8217;t love voluntary and
freely given? So, isn&#8217;t it a contradiction in terms to be commanded to love God? Not if you
understand two things: First, how gentle God&#8217;s commands. How kind his precepts are. His
commandments are not orders, but invitations. The Hebrew that is translated &#8220;thou shalt not&#8221; is
better translated in a pleading sense: &#8220;please don&#8217;t&#8221; . . . &#8220;don&#8217;t steal&#8221;, &#8220;don&#8217;t covet&#8221;, &#8220;don&#8217;t
commit adultery.&#8221; And second, we&#8217;re not alone in this. God doesn&#8217;t command us to love him and
then leave us alone to make it happen. I know that God will help you keep this commandment,
for he gives no commandment save he shall prepare a way for us that we can keep it.   
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">3. It says, with <i>all</i> thy mind. 
		</span>The word &#8220;all&#8221; is all-important here. Keeping this commandment
requires genuine completeness. You are commanded to love God with <i>all</i> thy heart, with 
		<i>all</i> thy
might, and with <i>all</i> thy mind. We have a word, &#8220;wholeheartedly&#8221;. Maybe we should coin a word,
&#8220;wholemindedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell spoke often about discipleship, submissiveness and consecration, especially in an
intellectual setting. He has sensitized us to the dangers of what he calls &#8220;holding back,&#8221; of not
loving God with all the mind that we could. As he wrote in <i>BYU Studies</i>: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Whatever our particular fields of scholarship, the real test is individual
discipleship, not scholarship. . . . We usually tend to think of consecration in
terms of property and money . . . but there are so many ways of keeping back part
and so many things we can withhold a portion of besides property. All things</i>
[including our minds]<i> ought to be put on the altar</i></p>
<p>of sacrifice. Our minds must bend, as well as our knees.</p>
<p>Our mind is often the last thing we are willing to let go of. We are so proud of ourselves as we
latch onto certain ideas or slogans or trendy disciplines that become so all-important and
persuasive to us. But our pet ideas are often the beginning of our undoing. A wise drama teacher
once said, &#8220;Forget your best idea.&#8221; Clinging to it or becoming fixated on it will often block the
flow of even better ideas and more expansive inspiration. Our objective is not to see things
according to our minds and our inevitable personal biases but in accordance with God&#8217;s mind; to
say, Not my idea, but thine be thought.</p>
<p>Fortunately, each of us has been blessed with definite mental talents, with plenty to give forth. It
is true that some minds work better in one mode than in another, but that&#8217;s beside the point: you
can and must love God with your weakest mental abilities (be they in math or music), as well as
by playing to your strengths (be they in language or physics), for it says &#8220;with all thy mind.&#8221;
Surely, in any given setting, God cares less about what we give him, than if we have brought the
best we can, whatever that may be.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">4. There will be many ways to <i>love God 
		</i>with our minds. </span>Sister Welch and I have a pillow on
our bed. On it are words of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, <i>&#8220;How do I love thee? Let me count the
ways.&#8221; </i>With similar sincerity and fervor, let us count the ways we love God with our minds and
love him <i>&#8220;to the depth and breadth and height my</i> [mind] <i>can reach, when feeling out of sight
for the ends of Being and eternal Grace, . . . to the level of every day&#8217;s most quiet need, . . .
freely, . . . purely, . . . with passion put to use, . . . and, if God choose, . . . even better after
death.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If you love a person, you notice and admire the fantastic things he or she has done. In 1958,
Elder Howard W. Hunter said, <i>&#8220;He loves God with all his mind who . . . sees God in all things
and acknowledges him in all ways&#8221; </i>(CR Apr 1958). Thus you love God with your mind by being
observant of the things he has created&#8212;by appreciating the amazing things that he has given us
in the worlds of chemistry or geology, scriptures, or linguistics.</p>
<p>We love God with our minds by caring about the problems he cares about. How can you say to
your mom that you love her but at the same time say you don&#8217;t care about the things she cares
about? </p>
<p>We love God with our mind by embracing his work, giving it the best of our planning, research
and problem solving. Figuring out what you can say or do as a Home Teacher or Visiting
Teacher to help someone to repent is as challenging an intellectual tutoring task as exists
anywhere. Show me that you can do that and I&#8217;ll be truly impressed with your mind.</p>
<p>We love God with our minds by figuring how to forgive his children. It takes mental effort to
forgive other people, which always begins by thinking considerate, non-judgmental thoughts
about them. Nothing is more important than learning to forgive, the ultimate in human
understanding.</p>
<p>When we love God we want to be like him. And it takes careful thought to process all that we
can know of him. </p>
<p>Loving God means loving his words. I love the scriptures, although I admit that some chapters
are harder to love than others. You love God with the mind by memorizing scriptures, knowing
his words by heart. The conversation between Jesus and the Scribe was possible only because
both of them knew their Torah passages by heart. We rely too much on our books and hard
drives. Your mind can actually retain far more than you imagine. One of the best things I ever
did was to take a challenge from my leader in the MTC to memorize all of the Sermon on the
Mount in Matthew 5-7 in German. It&#8217;s not impossible, as any drama student will tell you. In an
Honors Book of Mormon class, I had my students memorize most of King Benjamin speech.
One of those students later recalled, &#8220;When we first got the assignment it was overwhelming, but
it was probably the most rewarding assignment I&#8217;ve ever had. That text has been my most
helpful scripture.&#8221; Why? Because it was known and deeply embedded in her remembrance bank. 
		</p>
<p>We love God with the mind by skillful analysis of problems. It is often said that God is in the
details. And, at the same time, don&#8217;t forget to love God with skillful synthesis as well, seeing
things as one great whole. When I go to the temple, I give mental attention to the tiniest details
and to the ceremonious choice of carefully deployed individual words; but at the same time, my
mind sees the temple as a template, as a pattern and as a grand cosmic roadmap that tells me
where I am and where I am going.</p>
<p>We love God with the mind by asking good and righteous questions. There is nothing wrong
with asking. In fact, we are commanded to ask, seek, and knock. Joseph Smith responded to the
invitation of James, <i>&#8220;let him ask of God&#8221; </i>(James 1:5). Our scribe in Mark asked Jesus a good
question, a much better question in fact than the unlikely hypothetical concocted by the
Sadducees about a supposed 7-time widow who had remarried six of her husband&#8217;s brothers (get
real! Did such a widow really exist?). We need to spend more time discerning between good
questions and bad ones. It won&#8217;t do to be knocking on the wrong door. As examples of good
questions, look at the fifty questions Alma asks in Alma chapter 5, or the many questions Jesus
asked people in Galilee or Jersualem.</p>
<p>We love God by listening better to him and to those who speak for him. A good measure of
people who love each other is how well they listen to each other. Listening is a mental process. It
involves attentively understanding and processing what we hear. Notice that the scribe repeated
back (a good communication strategy) what Jesus said, and then thoughtfully commented on its
implications. </p>
<p>How do I love God, let us count the ways. I am sure that we could count many more. Here at
BYU-Idaho you can learn to love God with your mind, as an integrated soul, with every fiber of
your being.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">5. With all thy <i>mind</i>.</span> Next, we learn from the conversation in Mark that Jesus cares very much
about our <i>minds.</i> Let&#8217;s think a minute about the mind. We can see here that Jesus saw no
irreconcilable conflict between the heart and the mind. Indeed, the restored gospel of Jesus
Christ exquisitely harmonizes traditional paradoxes by embracing both study and faith, reason
and revelation, truth and goodness, grace and works. The one is not without the other in the
Lord. I was involved with the recent bicentennial conference in honor of Joseph Smith at the
Library of Congress; among the presenters, some division arose over whether we should
understand the Prophet through the Enlightenment lenses of science, rationality, and objectivity,
or through the Romantic sensitivities of emotion, revelation, and subjectivity. Surely, again, the
answer must be &#8220;both.&#8221; The gospel transcends and thus can unify both. For Joseph Smith, the
gospel strives for completeness, abundance, and the fullness of eternal life, not just either half of
it.</p>
<p>Getting the heart and the mind together is a wonderful experience. It is not easy to describe the
collaborative workings of the two, but analogies can help. Getting the spirit and intellect together
is like seeing with two eyes allowing depth perception lacking through a single lens. I find it is
like playing a violin which requires two hands, each performing its own function to produce a
transforming, harmonious melody. Or as one of my students suggested, it&#8217;s like chocolate milk:
chocolate and milk taste fine alone, but even better together.</p>
<p>Just as Jesus carefully noticed that the Scribe answered with great intelligence, he also notices
and cares what you think, what is taught and thought in each of your classes. I know that God
cares and watches out for our intellectual endeavors. The surgical testimony of Elder Nelson
shows that God will help things happen that far exceed our human ability. Have miracles ceased?
No, in fact Mormon in Moroni 7 says that miracles are ministered <i>&#8220;unto them of strong faith 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">and
a firm mind </span>in every form of godliness&#8221; </i>(Moroni 7:30, emphasis added). 
		</p>
<p>I have a testimony that God helps us in our righteous academic pursuits, often through the help
of other people. </p>
<p>For example, one day with no appointment, I hoped to meet with a museum curator in Florence,
Italy, only to find that a faithful Church member of the local branch just happened to be
substituting for a friend at that museum that morning and I was able to learn what I needed that
day. </p>
<p>Another day, a person walked into my office with the precise skills I had been praying for, only
to tell me she didn&#8217;t know why she had come but that she had felt impressed not to stay with
another job and wondered if I needed any help.</p>
<p>Two months ago, as I hopelessly faced a delivery date two days away to send items to the
Library of Congress, a professional photographer called me out of the blue with exactly what I
needed&#8212;an answer to prayer.</p>
<p>Racing against a crucial year-end deadline after months of work, my staff at BYU Studies finally
downloaded a huge, unprecedented collection of scanned Church historical documents onto 74
DVD production masters; with that only set successfully in hand, they watched as our custom
designed system of linked hard drives crashed irrecoverably only a few hours later. 
		</p>
<p>I cannot believe that these things were mere coincidences. I know that God inspires us, but often
only after we have paid the price of study directed by the light of faith. As a missionary in
Germany in 1967, I attended a few lectures at a Catholic theological seminary on what we called
Diversion Day. There I heard about the writing style in the Bible known as chiasmus. My
companion and I purchased a book that the professor had mentioned. We studied the book
carefully and reread the entire gospel of Matthew with this tool of literary analysis in mind. Only
after this effort and careful study was I awakened early one morning by the words, &#8220;If it is
evidence of Hebrew style in the Bible, it must be evidence of Hebrew style in the Book of
Mormon.&#8221; I wondered why no one had ever seen this feature in the Book of Mormon before; yet
with faith that it might be so, I got out of bed and began reading where my companion and I just
happened to have left off the night before. In a few minutes I discovered the classic chiastic
passage in Mosiah 5:10-12, and soon after encountered several others. I never would have found
this on my own. I don&#8217;t know that the Book of Mormon is true because I find these things;
rather, I can find these things because I know that the record is true. As President Packer has
cautioned, we should not say <i>&#8220;I know the gospel is true, however . . . .&#8221; 
		</i>Rather, <i>&#8220;I know the
gospel is true, therefore . . . .&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I know that God will show us more than we can see by ourselves. I know that God rewards our
minds after long hours of service. Some of my favorite scripture insights, making sense of
intellectual and spiritual challenges throughout my life, have come at weary hours of the night
during my service as a bishop. Ironically, my most productive years as a scholar have been those
years when I have been busiest serving as bishop.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">6. Loving God is not just any commandment. It is the 
		<i>first</i> one. </span>What do we make of the fact
that loving God is the prime commandment? It is first because all else follows from it. Loving
God is the well-spring of all righteousness, and loving him with all your mind is the tap root of
true intelligence.</p>
<p>True unity of purpose flows from loving God with our minds. By reaching consensus, righteous
Saints echo the harmony of the Godhead itself. This is why contention and disputation are so
abhorrent to God, and why, if we are not one, we are not his.</p>
<p>True obedience flows from loving God with our minds. John 14:15 reads, &#8220;<i>If ye love me, keep
my commandments.&#8221; </i>The Greek can also be translated, <i>&#8220;if you love me, you 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">will</span> keep my
commandments.&#8221;  </i>Thus, when you love God with all your mind, you will mind him and mind all
his precepts. And in minding him always, you keep him always in mind. You think of him often.
You want to share with him your whole day, and every day, Sundays and Fridays, days and
nights, and everything you have said and done. </p>
<p>Likewise, love gives the benefit of the doubt. You do not believe false rumors or buy false
assumptions about those you love. When you love God with your mind, you think kind and
generous things about Him. These things flow from loving God first. </p>
<p>While you cannot talk yourself into loving God or anyone else, it is indeed possible to talk
yourself out of love, so give heed first to what you think of him. Joseph Smith said that a correct
understanding of God&#8217;s character and a reassurance that God approves of your conduct is
foundational to a living faith in God. Loving God generatively leads to all else that is of the
divine nature.</p>
<p>This is why the second commandment is like unto this, the first. When we love God first, we
love those whom he loves, namely his children. Surely, Joseph Smith taught this principle as
well. He embodied the love of God and of all mankind. On Oct 19, 1840, he said to the Twelve: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity, and ought to be manifested by
those who aspire to be the sons of God. A man filled with the love of God is not
content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world,
anxious to bless the whole human race. . . . Let every selfish feeling be not only
buried, but annihilated; and let love to God and man predominate and reign
triumphant in every mind.</i></p>
<p>Which brings me to my seventh and final point, a word of warning and encouragement: 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">It is
possible to break this commandment.</span></p>
<p>Because it is a commandment to love God with all our mind, we must also acknowledge that we
may break this commandment. How does this happen, and if it does, what must we do?</p>
<p>We break this commandment when we act contrary to the degree of knowledge that we have
received, for with increased knowledge comes an elevated duty to measure up to a higher degree
of accountability.</p>
<p>&#160;We break this commandment when we promote ideas that injure other people. As Jesus said, it
is inevitable that offense will come, but wo unto him by whom offense cometh.</p>
<p>You break this commandment when you harbor in your mind errors that implicitly deny the
existence, love, power, or knowledge of God. As a bishop, I&#8217;ve heard people say, &#8220;Everyone is
doing it.&#8221; But wait a minute, Is God doing it? They say, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t stop.&#8221; But this denies the
power of God. Couldn&#8217;t God help you stop? They say, &#8220;It&#8217;s my life, I can do what I want with
it.&#8221; But doesn&#8217;t your life also belong to God? When they say &#8220;Every point of view is equally
valid,&#8221; where does that leave God&#8217;s view? When you think, &#8220;No one will notice,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t God
notice everything? Or &#8220;I have no friends.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t this deny that He is your friend? These
excuses are wicked, not so much because they are logically flawed or psychologically unhealthy,
but because they deny God&#8217;s place in your life. They mentally reject the love of God, and thus
break the first and greatest commandment.</p>
<p>We break this commandment whenever we believe Satan, the enemy of all righteousness.
Beware: Satan is the father of lies. And he&#8217;s a good liar. I doubt that anything Satan ever says is
true. At most, it is a half truth. When he says to Eve or any of us, <i>&#8220;Ye shall not surely die&#8221;
		</i>(Moses 4:10), he is not telling the whole truth. And when he says, 
		<i>&#8220;All these things will I give
thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me&#8221; </i>(Matthew 4:9), he is making a hollow promise on
which he cannot possibly ever deliver. </p>
<p>Take his lie of pornography. Satan tells us we will find love and satisfaction by ogling enticing
but lifeless pornographic images. This is simply a lie. Virtual reality is neither virtuous nor real. 
		</p>
<p>And, even more than that, how can we possibly love God with <i>all</i> our mind, if even part of our
mind is filled with pollution? When I entered college as a freshman in 1964, the world was just
beginning to worry about environmental pollution. Previous generations had foolishly believed
that the oceans could absorb an endless amount of garbage and waste. We soon learned that
pollution didn&#8217;t just go away.</p>
<p>People are just as na&iuml;ve today. They think that the human mind can absorb an endless amount of
filth and violence, and that somehow we will just push a delete key in our brain and all that will
be erased. That simply will not happen. The brain has incredible powers of retention. Whether or
not you can recall information during a test, it is all still there. Old folks often find that their
brains remember things they haven&#8217;t thought of for decades. Mental pollution sticks; there are no
teflon brains. Just as it is true that <i>&#8220;whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life,
it will rise with us in the resurrection&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 130:18), so too, whatever
degree of unrepented smut or cynicism we attain unto, it will rise with us as well.</p>
<p>Thus, Moroni says, <i>&#8220;Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourself of all
ungodliness . . . and love God with all your . . . mind&#8221; </i>(Moroni 10:32).  Notice here that you
cannot perfect your mind without his help. We often think of the effects of the Fall on our mortal
bodies, but our minds are also in a fallen state. Our minds must also be redeemed from the Fall.
This happens by repenting of our bad or erroneous thoughts, submitting to the will of Christ, and
taking up the mind of Christ.</p>
<p>So, if you find that you have broken this commandment to love God with all your mind, as with
any other sin, you must repent and be redeemed through the atoning blood of Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>You must recognize your mental sins. All of us involved in higher education must take particular
care to repent of our academic pride. Pride is the main occupational hazard of scholars, who too
quickly suppose <i>&#8220;they know of themselves&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 9:28). </p>
<p>Next, you must feel remorse for your mental sins. Like Zeezrom, we must suffer spiritual
migraines over our intellectual mistakes (Alma 15:3, 5). In many ways, their effects are the
hardest to undo, but through Christ&#8217;s atonement, the human intellect can be transformed into an
instrument for loving God.</p>
<p>Relying on the grace and goodness of God, we must overcome our rebellious thoughts every bit
as much as our disobedient actions. We must pray, &#8220;and lead us not into intellectual temptation&#8221;
as much as any other kind of temptation.</p>
<p>So the question ultimately becomes, Has your thinking been redeemed? Has your mind been
justified and sanctified by the blood of Christ? Has your mind &#8220;yielded to the enticings of the
Holy Spirit&#8221;? Do you have no more disposition to think evil? Or, to use the words of Paul in
Romans 12, Have you been <i>&#8220;transformed by the renewing of your mind </i>(your 
		<i>nous</i>)&#8221; (Romans
12:2)? </p>
<p>If so, the Lord will cause your mind to expand, as Alma promised in Alma 32 (Alma 32:34). He
will write his laws and covenants upon your mind, as Jeremiah guaranteed (as quoted in
Hebrews 8:10). </p>
<p>And in the end, if you love God with all your mind, you will be fit for the 
		<i>kingdom,</i> as Jesus
declared to the bright young lawyer. And what a promise! In this life, we are playing for keeps,
		<i>&#8220;for as</i> [a man] <i>thinketh in his heart, so is he&#8221; 
		</i>(Proverbs 23:7), and in the day of judgment, even
our unrepented thoughts will weigh against us (Alma 12:14). But if you <i>&#8220;worship him with all
your might, mind, and strength,&#8221; </i>Nephi promises, <i>&#8220;ye shall in nowise be cast out&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi
25:29) and as Moroni assures, <i>&#8220;the hope of his glory and of eternal life 
		</i>[shall] <i>rest in your mind
forever&#8221; </i>(Moroni 9:25).</p>
<p>In conclusion, may I offer a blessing and testimony in your behalf? May you not just go through
BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho, but may BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho go through you. May you know, as I do know, that it is
possible to love God with all your mind, and may you let him help you to do so. May you love
God with invigorating questions. May you faithfully and intellectually discern between truth and
error. May your brain be keen and sharp, but may you never harm even the least intelligent of
God&#8217;s children. In the exercise of your academic freedom, may you intellectually choose to
spend time on subjects of <i>&#8220;liberty and eternal life&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 2:27), not captivity and death.</p>
<p>May you pray over your books, as you would bless food for thought. May you pray as you go to
class, and not just as you walk into a test. I testify that the love of God will give harmony and
value to all that you think and do. I pray that your mind may become perfected in Christ, and that
in all of this may you be found not far from the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.<span>&#160;</span></p>

<p>It is an honor to stand before you today. I come to you with a grateful heart. I am grateful for a
loving Heavenly Father and for his Beloved Son, whose grace and power have blessed my life. I
am grateful for President and Sister Wilkes and Elder and Sister Kerr and the kindness and
support they have given to Sue and me. I am grateful for my family, and for Sue, who is the love
of my life. In a week we will celebrate our thirty-fourth anniversary, and I thank God every day
for her. I am also grateful for this wonderful opportunity that has come to Sue and me. Thank
you for coming today to listen to us talk, to share with us your love of this university and your
faith and prayers. </p>
<p>I would like to share with you today some things I have learned from my experience and from
the scriptures about learning and about schools. I speak today from the heart about things that I
love.</p>
<p>From the time I was a little boy growing up in Salt Lake City, to this very day, I have loved
school. I love to learn, to discover new things. And I love to teach. Schools and education have a
special place in my heart and, I believe, a special place in the Restoration and in the Kingdom of
God.</p>
<p>I would like to begin with two of my favorite scriptures: the first is from the 88<sup>th</sup> section of the
Doctrine and Covenants; the second is from the 17<sup>th</sup> chapter of Alma.</p>
<p>The 88<sup>th</sup> section is one of the most important revelations of the Restoration about learning,
education, and the gospel. There is a phrase in verse 78 that I would like to talk about today. In
this section the Lord commands us to teach each other the doctrines of the kingdom and to seek
learning, by study and by faith. If we seek and teach with diligence, He gives us this marvelous
promise in verse 78:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed
more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all
things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to
understand;</i></p>
<p>The phrase I want to focus on today is <i>my grace shall attend you</i>. That marvelous promise
extends to all of the things you study at this university. Whether you are studying the gospel, or
mathematics, or music, or history, or computer networking, the Lord will bless you to learn by
study and by faith. We have in the Book of Mormon a great example of these principles in action
in the experience of the sons of Mosiah. Turn with me to the 17<sup>th</sup> chapter of Alma, verse 2. This
is Mormon&#8217;s description: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared
unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what
added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had
waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound
understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might
know the word of God. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting;
therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when
they taught, they taught with power and authority of God</i> (<span style="font-family: 'Times', serif">Alma 17:2-3</span>). 
		</p>
<p>The sons of Mosiah had sought knowledge of the truth, and they had obtained it in just the way
the Lord outlined for each of us. In fact, Mormon&#8217;s description of what they did provides a
pattern for all of us who seek learning by study and by faith. Here is the pattern:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">1. Make and keep sacred covenants with the Lord</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The sons of Mosiah had been set apart by their father to preach the gospel to the
Lamanites. When Alma met them fourteen years later they had been true to the
covenants they had made. They were still his brethren in the Lord.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. Search diligently</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The sons of Mosiah had searched the scriptures diligently. This means that they
had not only read them, but also pondered them. That is why they were men of
sound understanding. That is why they waxed strong in the knowledge of the
truth.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">3. Seek the Spirit through fasting and prayer</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The sons of Mosiah did more than study and think about what they read. They
sought the guidance of the Spirit through prayer. They went further and prepared
themselves to receive the ministry of the Spirit by fasting. Because they were
obedient and diligent, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ attended them. They
received the spirit of prophecy and of revelation; and when they taught, they
taught with power and authority of God.</p>
<p>This is the pattern the Lord has given us. It comes with a powerful promise; and I know that
when the Lord says, <i>&#8220;my grace shall attend you,&#8221;</i> He is giving us a 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">true</span> promise.</p>
<p>Let me share with you three personal experiences that have taught me about the Savior&#8217;s grace,
and about learning by study and by faith. I share these personal experiences in the spirit of Alma
26 (see Alma 26:11-12). Though they are personal, they are really about the hand of the Lord
and his strength in our lives.</p>
<p>The first story occurred many years ago when I was in graduate school studying economics. I
took a course from a very famous and prominent professor named John Dunlop. I studied hard in
that course, and I prepared diligently for the final exam. I also prayed for help and guidance. The
day for the exam came. The final exam in that course was unusual. Instead of giving us essay
questions or problems to work, Professor Dunlop simply gave us two recently published papers
and asked us to critique them. I began to read. As I read, I experienced something I will never
forget. I saw clearly, as though someone had laid it all out before me, exactly what the authors
were trying to do, where the weaknesses in their argument were, and what I should write about
their work. I began to write. I wrote and wrote and wrote. The words just flowed. It was like
there was a conduit running from my brain down my arm through my hand into the pen and onto
the paper. It felt like the words were just flowing down the conduit. I then picked up the second
paper, and the same thing happened. I knew as it happened that the Lord had blessed me beyond
my own ability. I experienced what the Prophet Joseph once called &#8220;pure intelligence&#8221; flowing
from the Spirit to teach me and help me. At the end of that exam I knew that what was written in
those blue books was beyond my own capacity.</p>
<p>It has been 31 years since that experience. I have had that experience many times since. I hope
and pray that I shall have it many times in the future. As I look back on the day of that exam, I
can see the hand of the Lord at work. Because of that exam Professor Dunlop opened many
doors for me. Those experiences bear witness to me of the truth of the promises of the Lord, and
of the importance of seeking knowledge and learning by study and by faith.</p>
<p>The first story was about the power of the Spirit in the individual mind and heart of the student.
The second story took place many years later. It is about learning and teaching in the classroom.
By the time of this story I had joined the faculty at the business school at Harvard and was
teaching a class on managing technology and operations. One day we taught a case on Honda.
The CEO of Honda, a man named Kawamoto, sat in on my class. The case that day dealt with a
very narrow, technical issue about the design of the engine for a new Honda car. The issue was:
should we choose an existing design with a small bore and a long stroke, or should we go with a
new design with a wider bore and a shorter stroke. There were a lot of data on the costs involved
and a lot of background on the internal debates and positions. It was a hotly debated issue in the
company. </p>
<p>Let me set the stage for you. There were 90 students in the classroom. I called on a woman
named Kim Coupanas to start the class. She was fabulous. She laid out the issues, made a
decision, and backed it up&#8212;all in about five minutes. I asked her a couple of follow-up questions
and then turned to the class for their reactions. There must have been 30 hands in the air. In that
moment, something truly remarkable happened. Over the next 75 minutes, the students in that
class tore that case apart. They went deeper and deeper into the implications of the choice. My
role was like that of an orchestra conductor. I called on students, asked an occasional question,
summarized, and managed some transitions. But the students carried the whole class. They made
comments, challenged each other, debated each other, taught each other, clarified, added to, and
kept taking us deeper. It became clearer and clearer that what appeared to be a technical choice,
with financial implications, was in fact a deeply strategic, fundamental choice for Honda. This
was a choice about the company&#8217;s character, about the integrity of its promises and what it stood
for. The stakes were high, and the students were really engaged. Remember this was a business
class about engine design. But I felt a good spirit in that room, and it was an exhilarating 80
minutes. At the end of the class, Kawamoto-san was stunned. He told me that he was absolutely
amazed that those students could get that deep with that much power. It was an extraordinary
learning experience.</p>
<p>What happened in that class was, I believe, a gift. It came in part through the Light of Christ that
is given to everyone. And it came in part because we were dealing with a true principle, i.e., 
		<i>&#8220;. . .
out of small things proceedeth that which is great&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 64:33). But I have
come to understand that it came in part as a gift to me, to teach me important principles that the
Lord wanted me to know. That experience reinforced for me in a very powerful way the fact that
we teach and learn on multiple levels. I can see at least three. At Level 1 we teach and learn
facts, techniques, theories, and concepts. At Level 2 we learn and teach how to solve problems,
how to make decisions, how to create new meaning and understanding by applying what we
learn at Level 1. But Level 3 is deeper. At Level 3 we teach and learn about ourselves, about our
strengths and weaknesses, about who we are, what we believe, what we stand for. We learn
about character, and values, and what matters most. In that class, we got way beyond Level 1,
deep into Level 2, and we began to address Level 3. Each student who walked out of that class
learned that principle&#8212;and one other: they learned that there is no limit to what we can
accomplish if we work together. The very smartest student in that class walked into that class
with, at most, one-quarter of what the class as a whole produced. And the teacher learned too. I
taught the case I had prepared. But what we experienced went far beyond what I had prepared. I
learned that day that the classroom can be a place where <i>&#8220;my grace shall attend you&#8221; 
		</i>as the
Savior promised.</p>
<p>The last story happened recently after I had become dean. It taught me the power of a
community and that the grace of the Savior often works through those around us to bless our
lives. One day I had a discussion with one of my faculty colleagues. She had not been doing
well, and she came to see me. She explained to me that there was a great deal of stress in her life
and many difficult demands on her time. Her mother was dying of cancer and had been released
from the hospital to spend her last few weeks with her family in my colleague&#8217;s house. On top of
her two teenage sons, this was a heavy load to bear. I thought about her situation over the next
few days. As I reflected, something our bishop had said about living the gospel in the community
came to my mind. I had the impression that I should talk to my colleague about the Relief
Society and visiting teaching. At the very same moment, I also had the thought that I should be
careful not to impose anything on her. But I felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. 
		</p>
<p>Not long after I had this impression, I ran into her on the sidewalk outside my office. I told her
that I had been thinking about our conversation and that I had the solution to her situation. She
said, &#8220;Really? What&#8217;s the solution?&#8221; I said, &#8220;You need visiting teachers.&#8221; She naturally asked
me, &#8220;What are visiting teachers?&#8221; I then explained the Relief Society and visiting teachers. Her
eyes lit up, and she said, &#8220;That is exactly what I need.&#8221; I told her that if she would like some I
could make it happen. She said she would be delighted. So I called up our inspired bishop (my
colleague lives in our ward) who readily agreed. Our Relief Society president, Melanie
Marcheschi, assigned herself and a woman named Charlene Miner. Charlene and my colleague
became dear friends. And Charlene was enormously helpful. Here&#8217;s one example: on the day that
the mother died, at the very moment she passed away, Charlene rang my colleague&#8217;s doorbell,
having come on an impression that she should stop by. Charlene is a physician. She just stepped
into the house and literally took over. She arranged for the mortuary, signed the death certificate,
and made all necessary arrangements. Over the next several days, Melanie and Charlene
arranged for meals, made sure the house was clean, and gave my colleague wonderful support. 
		</p>
<p>This was a wonderful story, but it was not over. Charlene and Melanie continued to visit my
colleague and continued to bless her life. Not long after her mother died, my colleague&#8217;s oldest
son committed suicide. He had been struggling with terrible depression and finally took his life.
In that time, Charlene Miner was literally a lifeline. She brought peace, and comfort, and
friendship and, ultimately, hope to one who was suffering deeply. All through these experiences
Charlene and Melanie taught my colleague gospel principles and brought the Spirit of the Lord
into that home. It is so clear to me now, that the Lord was watching over my colleague.</p>
<p>That part of the story was inspiring, but very sad. It gets better. Charlene married later in life and
began having children not long after she became my colleague&#8217;s visiting teacher. I believe that in
part through Charlene&#8217;s example, and through long discussions, my colleague decided to have
more children. About a year later she gave birth to twin girls. What a miracle has been wrought
in her life. She went through a dark, difficult period; but through the ministry of faithful visiting
teachers, she came through it and has been renewed. She has learned so much in this time. And I
can tell you today, that my colleague is not only happier, but also far more effective in her work
at the school. She has just blossomed. It is wonderful to see.</p>
<p>That experience, and many, many others, has taught me that the Savior&#8217;s grace may find
expression in a learning community&#8212;a community in which people care about and invest in
each other. But, of course, you already know this. You have the Spirit of Ricks at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho.
Sue and I look forward with great anticipation to becoming part of this community. There is a
yearning in our hearts to experience, and contribute to, and enjoy with you the Spirit of Ricks at
BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho.</p>
<p>As I bring my remarks to a close, I would like to speak specifically to the students who are here.
My dear young brothers and sisters, a great responsibility rests upon you to build the kingdom of
God. Look ahead for a moment with the eye of faith. The Church is growing and flourishing in
the world in a wonderful way. But if you could see its future the way the Lord sees it, if you
could just catch a glimpse of that future through His eyes, you would see that there is much,
much more to be done. And there is much for you to do. It is so important to see with the eye of
faith, to see what is possible and to comprehend the great work of the Lord in the earth, and what
is ahead for you in His kingdom. To help you remember to do that, I would like to leave with
you today something that my dad taught me. My father passed away in June of 2001. He was a
kind and gentle man, and a great leader. My dad was a cowboy. He grew up in Southern Utah; he
loved horses, and he loved to ride. There is a saying he taught us that captures much about the
land he loved, and much about the spirit of leadership that was such an important part of his life.
The saying is: ride the high country.</p>
<p>My dad knew that we live our lives in the valleys, but we don&#8217;t always have to ride there. We
can ride the high country where the light is bright, and the sky is deep and blue, and where it
seems you can almost ride forever. The meaning of this saying is: set your sights high. Get up
out of the valleys and the shadows of everyday life and ride the high country. Soak up the light
that is there, and let the wind blow in your hair, let your dreams soar, let your spirit for life, and
for living, and for making a difference run free.</p>
<p>Now, my dad knew that you have to come back down to the valley and get to work to make
those dreams come true. But it is good to ride the high country. It is good to have an eternal
perspective. It is good to see that we are part of the great unfolding work of the Lord Almighty.

<p>Listen to the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1842 as he described this great latter-day
work: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has
penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country and sounded
in every ear; till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the great
Jehovah shall say the work is done. </i>(Statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the
Wentworth Letter, written March 1, 1842; see 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">History of the Church</span>, Vol. 4,
p.&#160;540).</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, the great prophet of the Restoration who ushered
in the dispensation of the fullness of times. The Prophet Joseph saw our day&#8212;he saw you&#8212;and
he rejoiced at your faith and your righteousness. He prophesied that the Church would go
forward boldly, nobly, and independent, because he saw us. This university also will go forward
boldly, nobly, and independent. I believe this university was established by revelation. And it
will go forward as part of the building of the kingdom. We are the ones the Lord has called to
carry that work forward boldly, nobly, and independent. This is our day. This is our time to stand
for truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>I know that Jesus is the Christ. He is the light and the truth. He is the sure foundation on which
we may build and learn and grow. Truly, his grace will attend us, in our hearts and minds, in our
classrooms, and in our community. </p>
<p>I know the Church is true. I know that Gordon B. Hinckley is the prophet of God. May God bless
us to seek learning diligently by study and by faith. I know if we do so, the grace of the Savior
will attend us and the God of heaven will pour out knowledge upon us. I pray that we may all
seek that grace and that knowledge, that we may be trusted and faithful servants of the Lord all
the days of our lives. I know that if we do so, we will build this university, we will build the
Kingdom of God, we will find joy and peace in this life and eternal life in the kingdom of our
Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to be here today. Last evening we flew in over the Grand Teton Mountains and
had a beautiful view of the highest peaks. They are majestic. </p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>We have never been in Rexburg before, so we are feeling rather new. That&#8217;s good! It&#8217;s a treat for
an old couple in their 50s to feel a little bit new!</p>
<p>President Clark and I feel that we are here on an errand from the Lord, as are all of you.</p>
<p>I was born and raised on a small farm in Waterflow, New Mexico. In that desert climate it took a
lot of effort to make things grow. My father worked hard irrigating the orchard, garden, and hay
fields so that the family and the farm animals would have food to eat.</p>
<p>Because water turns were regulated, when it was our turn for taking water, Dad would spend
hours out with his shovel guiding the water through the ditches, letting it run for just the right
amount of time onto each thirsty piece of the farm. There was no extra time to turn the water
onto the yard for a lawn, so we had a yard of hard-packed dirt paths, sandstone, sagebrush, and a
few lilacs and hollyhocks that my mother watered by carrying water from the ditch. A few
cottonwood and elm trees grew beside the ditch in front of the house to provide us with shade. It
was a wonderful playground.</p>
<p>But . . . </p>
<p>I always dreamed that some day we would move into town where we could have a yard with
sidewalks and lawns. Then we could walk out of the house without getting our shoes muddy on a
rainy day, and my sisters and I could practice our somersaults and cartwheels in soft green grass
on sunny days.</p>
<p>One spring as we were playing in the yard, we could see off in the distance the alfalfa field
where the new grass looked just like the beautiful lawn of which we had always dreamed. That
field beckoned to us; so we found our way across the cattle pasture to the barbed-wire fence
surrounding the field, and with some effort we were able to work the wire back and forth until it
loosened enough so that we could squeeze through without ripping our clothes on the barbs.
There we were in that beautiful sea of grass!</p>
<p>We learned quickly, however, that it wasn&#8217;t what it seemed. One attempt at executing a
somersault revealed that the ground underneath that grass was uneven and full of ruts and
gullies. We investigated a little further into the field and were unable to find what we were
looking for. But we had a good romp in the grass there anyway. </p>
<p>That night when Dad came in for dinner we were in trouble. He had noticed a trampled corner of
the alfalfa field and on closer inspection discovered where we had loosened the fence. He
explained, not too calmly, that a trampled field of alfalfa would yield very little hay and that the
loosened fence might allow a breakthrough by the cows that would further trample the grass and
they would become very sick from eating the green alfalfa.</p>
<p>We said we were sorry and that we wouldn&#8217;t do it again. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; we said, &#8220;that field is all full
of ruts and gullies and is very bumpy&#8212;not at all good for playing in.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Dad chuckled at our naivet&eacute;&#8212;and was glad to know that his fields would be safe from
us in the future.</p>
<p>I understand now that he was grateful for and appreciated those ruts and gullies in the alfalfa.
They were absolutely essential to the health of the grass. They facilitated the efficient flow of the
irrigation water through the field, allowing it to pool at just the right places where the grass roots
could get their life-giving drinks. </p>
<p>I grew up and left the farm and went to BYU. There I found sidewalks and green lawns aplenty.
For four years I spent hours walking those sidewalks in every kind of weather without getting
my shoes muddy. Though I was tempted, I never did try somersaults and cartwheels on those
beautiful lawns, but I did often enjoy a relaxing rest there.</p>
<p>Had I found the home of my dreams? Well, not exactly. You see, life at BYU had some ruts and
gullies. In fact, I have found that every time I have passed on to the next stage of life I have
found ruts and gullies.</p>
<p>At BYU the field of marriage beckoned to me, and I soon found myself married to a poor student
who dragged me off to live in Boston. There were some ruts and gullies in adjusting to marriage
and living in the city far away from home.</p>
<p>Soon the pastures of motherhood called; and as I awaited the birth of our first baby, I anticipated
that it would be like a perfect dream come true! But guess what! You got it&#8212;ruts and gullies!
Our sweet baby had colic and cried for hours every day for the first nine months of his life.</p>
<p>By the time the youngest of our seven children (twin girls) were potty trained, the respite I had
looked forward to after 13 years of changing diapers (without disposables) was filled with the
whirlwind of teenagers.</p>
<p>Last summer we had a perfect summer planned. Two of our sons were getting married, and we
would fill our now empty nest with all of our children and grandchildren at each wedding. It
would be a perfect summer. And we truly did have two wonderful gatherings and two wonderful
weddings: the first in May in the Salt Lake Temple and the second in August in the Mesa
Temple.</p>
<p>But something else happened last summer. </p>
<p>One week after the first wedding, one of our twin daughters found a huge lump in her neck and
came home for tests. It was determined that she had Hodgkin&#8217;s disease, a type of cancer of the
lymph nodes. She began a regimen of treatment by chemotherapy on June 1.</p>
<p>Then in August, just a week before the second wedding, I found out that I would need to soon
have major surgery to remove cancer from my colon.</p>
<p>The timing of both illnesses allowed us to have our wonderful family gatherings at both
weddings, and Julia still had hair for the family pictures in August! What a blessing! In fact, the
wonderful blessings we have received and the growth we experienced individually and as a
family are immeasurable. </p>
<p>It was a perfect alfalfa field summer. The ruts and gullies facilitated the flow of the living waters
of our Savior Jesus Christ as we sought Him through our trials. </p>
<p>Let me refer you to the story in the New Testament where Jesus offers living water to the woman
of Samaria at Jacob&#8217;s well:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now Jacob&#8217;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat
thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me
to drink.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew,
askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is

would have given thee living water.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof
himself, and his children, and his cattle?</i></p>

the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
everlasting life </i>(John 4:6-14).</p>
<p>I know that as we are beckoned by the alfalfa fields of life, and only cross into those fields that
keep us on our errand from the Lord, we will find that our ruts and gullies facilitate the flow of
the living waters of our Savior Jesus Christ to nourish the way. </p>
<p>I bear you my testimony that I know our Savior knows us and loves us. In the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">June 23, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Robert C. Oaks </p>
<p>During the intense persecutions of the Latter-day Saints in Missouri in late 1833, the Prophet
Joseph Smith received the 101<sup>st</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants. This revelation explained
that the persecutions had been allowed to take place because there had been <i>&#8220;jarrings, and
contentions, and envyings, and strifes . . . among them;&#8221;</i> . . . and, 
		<i>&#8220;by these things they polluted
their inheritances&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 101:6)</p>
<p>After completing his list of grievances against the saints, the Lord offers words of consolation.</p>
<p>In verse 22: <i>&#8220;Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according
to mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in holy places&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 101:22).</p>
<p>This riveting phrase, <i>&#8220;stand in holy places&#8221; </i>is repeated in the 45<sup>th</sup> and the 87<sup>th</sup> sections of the
Doctrine and Covenants, with the additional, sweet characterization, <i>&#8220;and shall not be moved&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 45:32, 87:8). These verses relate to the last days, with the admonition
to <i>&#8220;not be moved&#8221; </i>by the storms and the destructions associated with the second coming of Jesus
Christ. This emphasis gives a special, powerful meaning to the idea of <i>&#8220;standing in holy places.&#8221;
		</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>We should stand in holy places for our physical and our spiritual protection. With the stakes so
high why would we not, each day of our lives, do our utmost to indeed, stand where the Lord
would have us stand?</p>
<p>I love the art piece on the front of your Education Week brochure. The home is shown, backed
up by the chapel, which is further backed up by the temple. And, with a little imagination, we
might say they are all backed up by the beautiful, blue skies of heaven. We certainly know
through modern scriptures and prophetic instruction, that heaven stands squarely behind the
home, the church and the temples.</p>
<p>I will address your Education Week theme, &#8220;Stand in Holy Places,&#8221; in the context of each of
these three structures, home, chapel and temple. </p>
<p>Regarding our homes, President James E. Faust pointed out in his April 2005 General
Conference talk, <i>&#8220;Surely a . . . holy place on earth ought to be our homes.&#8221;</i> We spend a great
portion of our lives in our homes, and we should strive to create an atmosphere that, &#8220;feels holy.&#8221;
Attitudes of love, service and spirituality promote such an atmosphere, while attitudes of fault-finding, selfishness and contention preclude the development of any possible sense of holiness in
our home or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<p>We and our families deserve such a sanctuary from the buffetings of the world. School, work and
even the playground can be places of most unholy circumstances. Walking in the front door of
our home should provide an immediate contrast to the rest of the natural-man world. This sounds
utopian, but it is possible, if there is concerted effort on the part of all family members to make
the home environment different from the outside world environment.</p>
<p>Smiling faces, encouraging words, expressions of love, expressions of sincere interest in the
other family members and good music are all elements of a home which will actually make it
feel holy. It can be very humble in appearance and circumstance, but that just doesn&#8217;t matter.
The most memorable parties of my youth were not held in the biggest and most expensive homes
in town, but rather in the smaller, even crowded homes where family love was the order of the
day, every day. I did not realize it then, but on reflection, I would call those homes &#8220;holy
places.&#8221; The others were just &#8220;nice houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five years ago, when we were selling our home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and preparing to
move to Africa for our assignment in the area presidency, we had an interesting experience. We
left for a few days and turned our house over to a real estate lady to sell. After she had sold the
house she told us that normally when she held an open house on a weekend, she could hardly
wait to lock up at the end of the day, and get out and go home. However, in the case of our
home, she found a special feeling, so she just closed up and sat there for a while in order to enjoy
the spirit present. </p>
<p>We had dedicated and blessed our home when we first moved in and had tried to keep contention
out of the house. Consequently, even when we weren&#8217;t home a special feeling prevailed. We like
to think that there was a bit of holiness present in that home, and that it was a holy place in
which we could stand and feel protected from the more grinding influences of the world about
us.</p>
<p>Satan hates holiness in homes. He assaults homes whenever he can. Several years ago when our
children were young we moved into a new home in Virginia, but we failed to dedicate it right
away. We built bedrooms for our two oldest sons in the basement, but they were not comfortable
downstairs. They heard strange sounds and were scared to go to bed at night. There was not a
good spirit about that house. </p>
<p>We belatedly dedicated and blessed our house, and immediately the atmosphere changed. That
house became a home. Our homes should provide our most available &#8220;holy place&#8221; in which we
can regularly stand.</p>
<p>Our chapels should certainly be &#8220;holy places&#8221; in which we can take refuge. This is why we build
attractive, inviting structures, and dedicate them to the Lord&#8217;s purposes. They provide places for
those to, &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">gather together</span>,&#8221; who would &#8220;worship the Lord according to the restored gospel.&#8221;
President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated, if he were a bishop, he would focus on developing the
spirituality of his ward, and one of the first items he would emphasize would be weekly
attendance at sacrament meeting. </p>
<p>Why would he put so much emphasis on being together in a church meeting? When we gather
together in worship services we draw strength from one another. This strength flows from shared
testimonies as well as from the gospel knowledge gained through shared lessons. We grow
spiritually as we accept and magnify callings, and we strengthen our Christian character as we
provide charitable service to one another. That is what &#8220;gathering together&#8221; is all about. 
		</p>
<p>People may attempt to grow spiritually in isolation from others, but I have found it to be virtually
impossible to do so. During one portion of my military career I had very little opportunity to
associate with other Latter-day Saints. I tried to read the scriptures and stay close to the Lord, but
I was amazed at the negative spiritual impact of an extended period of spiritual isolation. I
understand fully why it is the Lord&#8217;s will that we &#8220;gather together.&#8221; We draw immense spiritual
strength from just associating with one another.</p>
<p>That is why it is so important to reach out to members who are not attending church regularly.
They need to feel the warmth of being with fellow Latter-day Saints. If our chapels do not have a
sense of reverence and a spiritual warmth about them, we need to do all in our power to provide
such a feeling. Without an atmosphere of love of the Lord, as well as a love of the members,
there is little hope that our chapels will qualify as &#8220;holy places&#8221; in which we can stand. For those
unable to attend the temples, the chapels are probably the best they have in terms of a holy place
where they can go and enjoy shelter and sanctuary.</p>
<p>Several years ago before sisters married to non-members went to the temple, we had a very
spiritual sister in our ward who would talk about our chapel in special terms. When people were
noisy and irreverent, she would remark, &#8220;shh, this is my temple. I like to come here in reverence
and feel the spirit.&#8221; Our chapels are dedicated to the Lord and deserve respect and reverence. 
		</p>
<p>During our three years in Southeast Africa, Sister Oaks and I were constantly impressed with the
African saints&#8217; worshipful attitude in all church meetings. In three years in a wide variety of
meetings in some 21 different countries, we never witnessed irreverent behavior.</p>
<p>We went to Sitima Village in Malawi to meet with the branch president. Three hundred and
twenty six people showed up, so we held a fireside in and around their dirt floored, mud walled,
tin roofed building. It was very crowded. Our backs were to the wall and we had children sitting
on our feet, with sweat running down their bare chests. Although they didn&#8217;t understand a word
we said, they sat quietly for over an hour. They knew reverence.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles commented following a recent
trip to East Africa, <i>&#8220;those people come to church to worship.&#8221; 
		</i>Our chapels and those who come
to worship in them deserve our reverence.</p>
<p>A final comment on chapels; one Sunday morning Sister Oaks and I were traveling through
Eastern Colorado and planned to stop for church in Holly, Colorado. We did not expect any
problem locating the chapel. When we found it, it was a remodeled house with a small parking
lot. As we drove in to the lot, the spirit washed over us both, simultaneously but independently,
and we knew we were in for a special, spiritual treat in that humble chapel. We were not
disappointed. Our chapels are indeed holy ground on which we are blessed to stand.</p>
<p>Of course, any discussion of holy places must include and dwell on Latter-day Saint temples. In
fact, at the very top of the list of holy places to stand are the temples of the Lord. Have you
stopped and considered how fortunate you are to live in an age when the holy temples are more
numerous and more accessible than they have ever been in the history of the Church of Jesus
Christ?</p>
<p>Temples have often been the objects of great sacrifice, both in the matter of building them and in
the matter of attending them. President Hinckley has made it a life project to bring the temples to
the people, but there are still many cases where it takes real sacrifice for the saints to get to the
nearest temple. In East Africa, the saints in Tanzania rode 3 days and 3 nights each way in a bus
without air-conditioning in order to get to the temple in Johannesburg. They would stop on the
side of the road to cook their meals, and then they would get back on the bus and drive on. 
		</p>
<p>The Kirtland Temple is one of my favorite temples, even though it is not a functioning temple as
we understand them. In fact, the Church does not even own this temple. The Community of
Christ or the former Reorganized LDS Church owns it and conducts tours through it. But when
you stand in that temple and look at the pulpit where Jesus Christ stood before Joseph Smith and
Oliver Cowdery and restored critical keys, it is both humbling and uplifting.</p>
<p>One afternoon after we had gone through the Kirtland Temple on a tour, I asked the guide why
he did not tell the tour group about the appearance of Christ on the pulpit. He shrugged and said,
&#8220;no one would believe me if I said that.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t say anything, but I wanted to shout, &#8220;we
believe it!&#8221; We do believe it, and we glory in it. Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith in that
beautiful temple, along with Moses, Elijah and Elias. Grand, dispensational keys were restored:
keys for the gathering of Israel and keys for the redemption of the dead. On that spot and on that
day, Christ gave great impetus to the restoration process. That is what happens in the Lord&#8217;s holy
places.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>This first temple of the dispensation of the fullness of times was built at great sacrifice on the
part of the saints there in Kirtland. To this day when the sun hits it right, you can catch the
sparkle reflecting from the bits of china which the sisters donated to be ground up and placed in
the plaster walls. It is beautiful. The saints were deeply in debt. They were struggling to build
communities. Many had been sent on to Missouri. The Lord knew they wouldn&#8217;t be in Kirtland
long. Why did he direct them to such sacrifice? In fact, he directed them in strong words in the
95<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Verse two of that section reads: 
		<i>&#8220;Wherefore, ye must
needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face; for ye have sinned against me a very
grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in all things, that I have
given unto you concerning the building of mine house.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>What was the purpose of that temple? How many baptisms were done there? None. How many
endowments were performed for the living or the dead? Very few that we know of. Verse 4 of
the 95<sup>th</sup> section states, <i>&#8220;for the preparation wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune
my vineyard for the last time, . . .&#8221; </i>that is what that temple was built for. 
		</p>
<p>The Lord wanted it built so he could appear to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery along with
ancient prophets and restore dispensational keys and to prepare his apostles for their critical
pruning work.</p>
<p>The Lord proved in the sacred grove he doesn&#8217;t have to have a temple available in order to
appear to men. But he proved in Kirtland that he prefers for sacred, sanctifying events to occur in
dedicated, holy temples. Hence these edifices are being built around the world at a breath-taking
rate in order that the sacred events of baptism, endowment and sealing might be performed in the
appropriate way under the hands of proper priesthood authority in a holy sanctuary. 
		</p>
<p>The sacred grove was sanctified by the presence of the Father and the Son for their visit with
Joseph Smith. The temples are sanctified by the sacrifice required to build them, and by the
prayers of dedication, but most importantly, by the sacred, eternal ordinances that are performed
within their walls. Thus they become &#8220;holy places&#8221; in which we can stand. And we do much
more than stand. We, <i>&#8220;prepare for the revelation which is to come, when the veil of the covering
of my temple in my tabernacle, which hideth the earth, shall be taken off, and all flesh shall see
me together&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 101:23). What a marvelous promise, 
		<i>&#8220;we prepare for
revelation in the temple.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>We also store up eternal blessings which we cannot fully appreciate in this life. As we turn our
hearts to our fathers and perform for them ordinances of eternal import, ordinances which they
cannot do for themselves, having passed beyond the veil, we complete rites which are absolutely
critical to their eternal progress.</p>
<p>Elder Todd Christofferson, of the Seven Presidents of the Seventy, tells of a beautiful experience
which highlights the importance of these ordinances. While he was serving as the executive
director of the Church Family History Department, in response to fasting and prayer, it was
revealed to him that, <i>&#8220;conditions on the other side of the veil are less than desirable for even the
good people who have not received the priesthood ordinances within the temple.&#8221; 
		</i></p>
<p>Focus for a moment on what this means. You and I have the power, every time we go to the
temple to do work for the dead, to improve the conditions of existence for someone on the other
side. We do not know any further details, but we don&#8217;t need to know any more than what we
have stated above. We just need to go and &#8220;stand in these holy places&#8221; we know as the temples
of the Lord. In so doing, we provide relief for souls who have waited for many, many years. 
		</p>
<p>There are books full of beautiful stories of temple sacrifice, of the pain and privation people
endure to get to the nearest temple. I heard a sweet, sweet story just a few weeks ago down in
Panama. I was attending a stake conference with an Area Seventy, Elder Luis Duarte, and he was
talking about the importance of temples when making our decisions regarding where to be
married. He was very poor when he and his wife were planning to get married. They lived in
Honduras, and the nearest temple was in Mexico City. Together, they had $90.00, just barely
enough to fly to Mexico and to return. They had no money for a wedding dress, a wedding ring,
or a wedding reception. A friend donated a cake that said, &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; on the top, and that
was it. But they had taken care of the most important matter, they had sacrificed enough to be
married in the temple. All of the other frills would be added on later. They stood in the most
important holy place on a most important day. They stood in the house of the Lord. 
		</p>
<p>We stand in these places to bless those who have gone before through the vicarious ordinances
we perform, but we also bless ourselves in dramatic fashion. First we perform our own temple
ordinances for our own eternal security and peace, but also we bring upon ourselves blessings of
inspiration, peace and even revelation by being obedient to promptings of the spirit of Elijah. 
		</p>
<p>There is one final aspect of holy places upon which I would like to briefly dwell. In this era
known as the last days, there are satanic influences all about us, waiting to draw us in and tar us
with dark, earthy stains. We cannot go into places of suggestive, seductive music, and
entertainment, or places of mind bending refreshments without being affected in unholy ways. 
		</p>
<p>Elder Henry B. Eyring related an instructive story during a visit to South Africa for an area
training meeting. While he was working in an office, some acquaintances came by and asked
him to go to lunch. He agreed, and en route they walked into a small shop that was much less
than he expected, with foul, offensive pictures on every wall. Although he immediately turned
and walked out he, could not get the corruptive images out of his mind, despite his fervent
prayers. After a few days the spirit spoke to him, saying, <i>&#8220;you did not pray to be led not into
temptation.&#8221; </i></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>In this world of evil and designing men, we are surrounded with disreputable places from which
we should pray every day to be led. There are innumerable combat stories of men and women
being miraculously led to safety on the battlefield. This life is a war, with eternal consequences,
and we should pray constantly to be led by the holy spirit through its minefields and pitfalls.
Avoiding unholy places is an important part of putting on the whole armor of God, and securing
his divine protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite our prayers and best avoiding efforts, sometimes our work, our schooling
or other circumstances may necessitate our being in conditions of language and images that are
less than we would desire. In such cases, the whole armor of God is of utmost importance. We
can, in fact, take our &#8220;holy place&#8221; with us. By our own high standards of language, entertainment
and general behavior we can actually raise the decency level of some less desirable places. We
should not seek these places out, with the hope we can lift them a bit. That is dangerous. But
when there is no choice, we can cloak ourselves in the Lord&#8217;s protective shielding and survive.</p>
<p>The best way I can explain this principle is to consider Arnold Friberg&#8217;s painting of Abinadi in
King Noah&#8217;s court, Chained and destined for death, but standing with great dignity, commanding
courage and even holiness in an unholy place, Abinadi&#8217;s conduct and preaching played the key
role in one of the greatest missionary moments in recorded scripture. Alma the senior, was
converted by Abinadi&#8217;s words and conduct and thus launched on his lifetime course of teaching,
baptizing and leading saints on gospel paths. </p>
<p>As we are raised up and frequently stand in the holy habitats of home, church and temple we can
build a holy, Christ-like character that will protect us and insulate us from the ungodly assaults
of Satan. By standing in holy places, thinking virtuous thoughts and doing our utmost to abide by
the eternal laws of the gospel, we can prepare ourselves to, &#8220;not be moved,&#8221; by the tumults of the
world. We can endure &#8220;until the day of the Lord come, to ever, &#8220;worship the Lord, according to
his everlasting gospel,&#8221; and even to, &#8220;receive revelation.&#8221; 
		</p>
<p>These lofty goals are attainable and certainly worthy of our diligent, lifelong pursuit. May we
ever be so engaged, I humbly pray, in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, of whose life and death
and life I testify, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Will Ye Now Come Unto Me&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Education Week Devotional</p>
<p style="text-align: center">June 24, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Interim President Robert M. Wilkes</p>
<p>We are focusing today on the idea of where we might stand that would be, or could become, a
holy place. My premise will be as follows: any place we stand that is on the pathway leading to
Christ becomes holy. Therefore, the issue of locating and following that path becomes of
essential significance to each of us. &#8220;<i>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that
when ye are assembled together ye shall <span style="font-weight: bold">instruct</span> and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">edify</span> each other, that ye may know how to
		<span style="font-weight: bold">act</span> and direct my church, how to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">act</span> upon the points of my law and commandments, which I
have given&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants&#160;43:8, emphasis added). This Doctrine and Covenants
reference contains three words of instructive significance, leading to what appears to be the
essence of the message: <span style="text-decoration: underline">instruct</span>, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">edify</span>, and 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">act</span>.</p>
<p>We do much to <span style="text-decoration: underline">instruct</span>. Most who do so have serious intention that their efforts will indeed
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">edify</span>, which we understand to imply that the one being instructed is being strengthened or
improved spiritually through the process (see 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Webster&#8217;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span>,
p.&#160;396). And then we trust that instruction which leads to edification will become both the
catalyst and the resource for the resultant action. I assume it is within the mark to observe that
not always do these elements occur in perfect sequence. It is no doubt true that not all instruction
results in edification, and not always does instruction and edification result in appropriate or
adequate action. But we who instruct typically pray that some linkage will occur. In any case, it
is of such matters I wish to visit with you today.</p>
<p>There would be few, if any, in this congregation who would not know at least the spiritual basics
of how one would proceed with coming to Christ. Most would have some understanding of the
requirement for faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. The great issue almost
always comes down to acting on what we know&#8212;to doing. Jesus made this eloquent plea to the
Nephites: <i>&#8220;O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now
return unto me </i>[<span style="text-decoration: underline">act</span>]<i>, and repent of your sins 
		</i>[<span style="text-decoration: underline">act</span>]<i>, and be converted 
		</i>[<span style="text-decoration: underline">be edified</span>]<i>, that I 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">may</span> heal
you?&#8221; </i>(3&#160;Nephi&#160;9:13, emphasis added). We sometimes do not fully grasp the truth that our
failure to act on what we know binds the Lord. Perhaps we count so much on His love for us and
His merciful atonement that we may be led to a groundless conclusion that in the end He will
simply not choose to deny us. We may miss the significance of the phrase <i>&#8220;. . . that I 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">may</span> heal
you.&#8221; </i>The fact that He may want to and yet not be able to is illustrated in these passages:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people
of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem . . . yea, how oft would I have
gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">ye would not</span></i> (3&#160;Nephi&#160;10:5,
emphasis added).</p>
<p>He was willing to heal them; but they, by their failure to be edified, their failure to act in certain
specific regards, would not let Him do it! And this is Israel with whom He is pleading. The
invitation is to those who had been spared.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that it appears to be the almost universal plight of men and women to, at least in
some degree, <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>know</i></span> more than we 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>do</i></span>. Perhaps then, creating a link between 
		<i>instruction</i> and
<i>edification </i>becomes the essential component in the process of coming to Christ.</p>
<p>It is upon certain elements of that link that I wish to center my remarks. There are, of course,
many elements&#8212;some of which will be unique to given individuals as per their own personal
relationship with the Savior. However, some of those elements of linkage would seem to be
rather universal in application. It is of those I wish to make observation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Believe That We Can Come Unto Christ</span></p>
<p>We must be believing! We must believe that we can come unto Christ. The importance of this
element is emphasized in 1 Nephi chapters 10 and 11. Having been taught the beauty of his
father&#8217;s vision, Nephi exclaimed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I . . . was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things . . .
which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him . . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen,
and <span style="font-weight: bold">believing</span> that the Lord was able to make them known unto me&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . the Spirit said unto me: 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Believest</span> thou that thy father saw the tree of which he
hath spoken? </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">believe</span> all the words of my father.</i></p>
<p>Then, only after making determination of Nephi&#8217;s level of belief, did the Spirit say to him<i>:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . blessed art thou, Nephi, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">because thou believest</span> in the Son of the most high
God; wherefore, <span style="font-weight: bold">thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired</span></i>. (1&#160;Nephi
10:17; 11:1, 4-6, emphasis added)</p>
<p>Then followed one of the most beautiful accounts in all of scripture relative to the Savior&#8217;s birth,
life, mission, death, and atonement.</p>
<p>Believing we can come to Christ necessitates our overcoming what, for many, is a natural feeling
of personal inadequacy. Typically, we tend to be amazed when our name is called for something
we judge to be beyond our mark. We do not think of ourselves as Relief Society presidents,
bishops, stake presidents, General Authorities, etc.</p>
<p>Our souls tend to resonate with that of David, who said when brought before the Lord: 
		<i>&#8220;.&#160;.&#160;. Who
am I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?&#8221; 
		</i>(2&#160;Samuel 7:18).
We might be encouraged in dealing with our inadequacies&#8212;real or imaginary&#8212;by a teaching
from Elder Joseph Fielding Smith given while he was serving as the President of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Salvation does not come all at once; we are commanded to be perfect . . . [but] it
will take us ages to accomplish this end. . . . That will not come all at once, but
line upon line, and precept upon precept, example upon example, and even then
not as long as we live in this mortal life . . .</i> (Bruce R. McConkie, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Doctrines of
Salvation</span>, Vol. 2, pp. 18-19)</p>
<p>An exaggerated awareness of our weaknesses and limitations may lead us to make comparisons
with others whom we esteem to be better qualified, better trained, or more naturally gifted. Of
such comparisons Elder Marvin J. Ashton said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I am also convinced of the fact that the speed with which we head along the
straight and narrow path isn&#8217;t as important as the direction in which we are
traveling. . . . There is a natural, probably a mortal, tendency to compare
ourselves with others. Unfortunately, when we make these comparisons, we tend
to compare our weakest attributes with someone else&#8217;s strongest. For example, a
woman who feels unschooled in the gospel may take particular note of a woman
in her ward who teaches the Gospel Doctrine class and seems to have every
scripture at her fingertips. Obviously these kinds of comparisons are destructive
and only reinforce the fear that somehow we don&#8217;t measure up and therefore we
must not be as worthy as the next person. . . . I feel that one of the great myths we
would do well to dispel is that we&#8217;ve come to earth to perfect ourselves, and
nothing short of that will do. . . . we will not become perfect in this life, though we
can make significant strides toward that goal</i> (<i>On Being Worthy</i>, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>,
May&#160;1989, pp. 20-21).</p>
<p>On another occasion, in personal conversation that occurred while Estella and I were on
assignment to a stake conference with him, Elder Ashton shared with us his significant concern
for parents who appear to claim undue credit for successful families while other parents tend to
assume undue blame for children who struggle in one way or another. He told us that, in his
view, most parents who rear great children <i>&#8220;. . . simply had great children to raise.&#8221; 
		</i>He thought
it conceivable that parents with challenging children might, in fact, be the better parents and, if
not for their parenting skills, their children may have had even greater challenges. He later
referenced this same notion during his April 1990 conference address:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Consideration for the feelings of others should always be important to worthy
Latter-day Saints. Rightfully we may be happy about the number of children with
which we have been blessed, the missionaries who have served, the temple
marriages of our offspring, and the accomplishments of family members; but
others who are not so fortunate may have feelings of guilt or inadequacy. They
may have been praying long and hard for the same blessings about which we are
boasting. These people may feel that they are out of favor with God</i> (<i>Neither
Boast of Faith Nor of Mighty Works</i>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, May 1990, p. 65).</p>
<p>Over the years, I have found his observations to be extremely comforting and a source of
encouragement for parents burdened with self-doubts concerning their acceptability and/or their
capacity.</p>
<p>Further evidence for the value of patience with self and the processes of edification was
indicated by President Gordon B. Hinckley at the 1995 Mission Presidents Training. He
explained that presidents would not know how effectively they had discharged their stewardship
until 25 years after their missionaries returned home. Only then would it be known how much
good their missionaries had done for others or how well they were doing personally and with
their own families, marriages, church service, and spiritual development (taken from Robert M.
Wilkes&#8217; personal notes). Such counsel seems to apply across much of the process of productive
living.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Have a Cause for Christlike Action That is Greater Than Our Own Self-Interest</span></p>
<p>For some of us to successfully bridge the gap from instruction to edification it will be helpful, if
not essential, for us to have a <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>cause</i></span> for Christlike action that is greater than our own self-interest. Joseph F. McConkie touched the essence of this idea when telling, as follows, an
incident in his own family history:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Many years ago in a small town in the southern part of the State of Utah, my
great-grandmother was called to be the President of the Relief Society. During
this period of our Church&#8217;s history there existed a very bitter and antagonistic
spirit between the Mormons and the Gentiles.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In my great-grandmother&#8217;s ward one of the young sisters married a Gentile boy.
This, of course, did not please either the Mormons or the Gentiles very much. In
the course of time, this young couple gave birth to a child. Unfortunately, the
mother became so ill in the process of childbirth that she was unable to care for
her baby. Upon learning of this woman&#8217;s condition, great-grandmother
immediately went to the homes of the sisters in the ward and asked them if they
would take a turn going into the home of this young couple to care for the baby.
One by one these women refused and so the responsibility fell completely upon
her.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>She would arise early in the morning, walk what was a considerable distance to
the home of this young couple where she would bathe and feed the baby, gather
all that needed to be laundered and take it with her to her home. There she would
launder it and then return with it the next day.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Great-grandmother had been doing this for some time when one morning she felt
too weak and sick to go and perform the service that had become her custom.
However, as she lay in bed, she realized that if she didn&#8217;t go the child would not
be provided for. She mustered all her strength and went. After performing this
service she, and I suppose only with the help of the Lord, was able to return to
her home, and upon entering her living room collapsed into a large chair and
immediately fell into a deep sleep. She said that as she slept she felt as if she were
consumed by a fire that would melt the very marrow of her bones. She began to
dream and dreamed that she was bathing the Christ child and glorying in what a
great privilege it would have been to have bathed the Son of God. Then the voice
of the Lord spoke to her saying, &#8216;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of
these ye have done it unto me&#8217; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">My Errand from the Lord</span>, A Personal Study
Guide for Melchizedek Priesthood Quorums 1976-77, pp. 154-55)</p>
<p>In its simplicity, this account becomes a remarkable reflection of how one might approach
edification on the wings of people and causes esteemed to be of greater importance than our
narrow self-interest. It is the heart and soul of the disciple&#8217;s way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Rise Above the Temptation to Self-Design Our Pathway to Edification and Discipleship</span></p>
<p>One who would successfully come to Christ would necessarily rise above the temptation to self-design his/her pathway to edification and discipleship. Paul taught that Christ, 
		<i>&#8220;. . . being made
perfect, . . . <span style="font-weight: bold">became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him</span>&#8221; 
		</i>(Hebrews&#160;5:9,
emphasis added). Moroni taught the doctrine as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and
cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people
of the church of Christ, and their names were taken, that they might be
remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">right
way</span>, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">relying alone upon the
merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith</span></i> (Moroni&#160;6:4,
emphasis added)</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;right way,&#8221; and it is Christ&#8217;s way. It is of His own authorship and design. To follow it
may require us to frequently, and sometimes for lengthy periods of time, employ a patience that
can only be born of faith. I recall the account of a young woman convert whose parents
disowned her when they discovered that she had been baptized. In fact, they went one step
further&#8212;announcing that they were &#8220;trying to forget she ever existed.&#8221; The young woman loved
her parents dearly and could hardly bear the cost of membership being imposed upon her. Yet
she persisted. She had been instructed, and she knew the right way! She patiently wrote weekly
letters assuring her parents of her love for them and avowing the correctness of her decision. For
many months she had received no response from them. She began to wonder if she could hold
out absent their love and support. One Sunday evening her phone rang. It was her mother. &#8220;We
cannot forget you ever existed,&#8221; the mother declared. &#8220;You are our daughter; we miss you, we
need you, and we love you. Could you possibly come home for a weekend? There are some
things we wish to say to you.&#8221; Eagerly the girl responded: &#8220;There are some things I wish to hear.
I&#8217;ll be home this weekend.&#8221; Her faith in the decision she had made was vindicated. The path
required for her personal edification had not been easy, but it 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">was</span> the &#8220;right way.&#8221; She had
followed the Savior&#8217;s path. It was not the path she would have designed for herself! But, in the
newness of her convictions, she found the strength to pursue the path Jesus had designed. It was
the path He had authored. Perhaps through her trial, she, like so many others, had come to know
something of the connective spiritual tissue that ties true instruction to genuine edification and
the attendant capacity to act.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Press Forward By Backing Off</span></p>
<p>Sometimes instruction contains counsel that surprises us. If not carefully understood, it may
almost seem to contradict itself. The fact is that, at times, pressing forward may require us to
back off or change our pace. On one occasion following a relaxing dinner and evening of
pleasant conversation with President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the stressful and critical
happenings of World War II, Prime Minister Winston Churchill observed that <i>&#8220;. . . it was the
nicest evening he had had! . . . <span style="text-decoration: underline">How easy it is really to do big things if you can get an hour off!</span>&#8221;
		</i>(Jon Meacham, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Franklin and Winston</span>, pp. 120-121, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Perhaps Nephi knew something of the spiritual benefit &#8220;an hour off&#8221; could have when he
described events prior to his astounding vision. He <i>&#8220;. . . sat pondering in 
		</i>[his] <i>heart&#8221; </i>and was
consequently<i> &#8220;. . . caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain,
which </i>[he]<i> never had before seen, and upon which </i>[he]<i> never had before set [his] foot&#8221;
		</i>(1&#160;Nephi&#160;11:1). Big things, indeed! His pondering prepared him for one of the greatest visions
ever recorded.</p>
<p>Enos also came to a vital self-realization and remembrance concerning the pathway to Christ
when he <i>&#8220;. . . went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which 
		</i>[he] <i>had often heard </i>[his]
<i>father speak concerning eternal life . . . </i>[sank] <i>deep into </i>[his] 
		<i>heart&#8221; </i>(Enos 1:3). Perhaps Enos,
too, pressed forward by stepping back through his &#8220;hour off&#8221; in the forests.</p>
<p>It may be the case that in part, at least, moving forward on the pathway to Christ, the path
referred to by Moroni as the right way, requires time&#8212;time to do big things, time to do
important things, time to:</p>

sponsors . . . and willing learners attend . . . Education Week. We all hope to instruct and to be
instructed. We have heard much and will yet hear more of things pertaining to faith, repentance,
baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost; of disciples and discipleship; of Coming&#8212;and of being
healed. We pray there will be, for each of us, glimpses of insight and discovery, even if fleeting
and incomplete. We speak of glimpses that, if reflected upon, prayed about, and pondered, could,
over time, take on qualities of strength and maturity . . . even understanding.</p>

unacknowledged capacities to:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;Some Thoughts About Standing in Holy Places&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Education Week Devotional</p>
<p style="text-align: center">June 24, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Estella W. Wilkes</p>
<p>I would like to share some thoughts with you about how we can stand in holy places through the
service we render to others. We tend to regard temples as models of holy places. The essence of
the temple is a place of service to others, particularly to those who cannot provide the specific
service for themselves. As is true with temples, we make other places holy through the unstinted
giving of ourselves to others. Our homes have the potential to be the holiest places of all through
the devotion that is manifest by caring and dedicated families. </p>
<p>When I was a little girl, I loved to walk beside my father and hold onto his hand. His hand was
so strong and warm, and his very large hand covered my tiny one entirely. My father grew up on
a farm in the Uintah Basin in Eastern Utah. As a young man he became a laborer and worked
hard all of his life. When I looked at his hands, I wondered why there were cuts and scrapes, and
why some of his fingernails were purple. I would hold tightly to his hands, trusting completely to
go wherever he guided me.</p>
<p>My Grandmother Petersen, my mother&#8217;s mother, lived one block from us. She spent a lot of time
in our home with our family. Her hands fascinated me. They were very wrinkled with veins
standing out on the top of them. The skin was work worn, and the knuckles on her right hand
were larger then those on her left. I didn&#8217;t ask anything about her hands. I was busy thinking
about other things. But I frequently noticed and thought about them.</p>
<p>My mother had pretty hands. They were very tiny and petite&#8212;so much smaller than mine are as
an adult. As I was growing up, I would think how much my mother&#8217;s hands were beginning to
resemble those of her mother, my grandmother. The skin was becoming wrinkled, and the veins
stood out on the tops of them. At the time I could not fully appreciate what the 
		<i>telltale signs</i>
meant. I understand better now&#8212;through the eyes of my own learnings, gained from both the
joys and challenges of living.</p>
<p>Years passed, and I became a bride. How I loved and still love to hold my husband&#8217;s hands. His
love, understanding, and guidance have always been felt in his gentle touch. </p>
<p>As a child I often felt a little sad when I saw the hands of my mother, my father, and my
grandmother. Now I see my own hands becoming engraved with lines. As the years of caring for
babies, growing children, parents, grandchildren, and my husband carve their own inevitable
creases in my hands, I am discovering an awareness and a gratitude for what caused their hands
to look as they did. As I picture in my mind my mother&#8217;s hands, my father&#8217;s hands, my
grandmother&#8217;s hands, my husband&#8217;s hands, and my hands, a smile comes because I realize why
all of our hands look so much alike. A combination of time, experience, and service marks them
with a beauty that only much of doing, in behalf of others, can so artfully design.</p>
<p>President Heber J. Grant once said, <i>&#8220;The real secret of happiness in life . . . is service&#8221;</i>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Heber J. Grant</span>, 15: Labor for the Happiness of Others,
From the Life of Heber J. Grant, p. 139). Happiness, as well as holiness, really is a by-product of
helping others. We have been taught that no one ever finds happiness by thinking of his or
herself.</p>
<p>A woman came to Elder S. Dilworth Young at a time he was caring for his invalid wife. The
woman said, &#8220;I am coming to your house every Friday night from six until ten. You can count on
it, so plan to . . . find relief for those four hours.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;What can I do to help you?&#8221;
because she knew President Young would say, &#8220;I&#8217;m handling everything just fine.&#8221; But rather,
she decided what would be helpful and took action. President Young later commented about this
experience: &#8220;How blessed she was to me. How good! She blessed both me and my wife with new
cheer, new smiles, and new ideas&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Love That Never Faileth</span>, Barbara B. Smith, p. 21).</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father has given each of us the opportunity to make a difference in the life of
someone else. In Doctrine and Covenants 81:5 we read: <i>&#8220;Wherefore, be faithful; . . . succor the
weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.&#8221; 
		</i>Perhaps this
reference will bring to each of our minds people who need our love, people who need our
kindness, and people who need our help.</p>
<p>When I was five years old, my mother and her sister lived in homes located next to each other. I
had been playing at my aunt&#8217;s home and left to walk across the field to my own home. I became
frightened as I saw black smoke and fire coming out of the roof and windows of our home. A big
red fire engine was on our driveway, and so were a lot of people. I began running. When I
reached our home, I saw my mother wrapped in a quilt. She was badly burned. She was placed in
an ambulance and taken to the hospital. In the middle of the excitement and confusion, a hand
reached out and took mine. It belonged to our neighbor, Hazel Haslam. She took me home with
her and cared for me for nearly a month. My two older brothers were taken into the homes of
relatives. My father spent all of his time at the hospital. As soon as it was known that mother
would be all right, dad began repairing and rebuilding our home. Friends, neighbors, and ward
and family members joined in to help Dad. I will always remember those who brought us meals,
bottled fruit, and loaves of homemade bread; they gave encouragement, help, support, and love
to our family. I will never forget the hand of our neighbor, Hazel, as she reached out and took
my little hand in hers.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball has told us: <i>&#8220;God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is
usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each
other . . .&#8221; </i>(<i>Small Acts of Service</i>, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, December 1974, p. 5.) Participation in the answering
of such prayers may consist of words that encourage or help with an everyday task essential to
the relief of one in need. President Kimball further indicated, <i>&#8220;When we are engaged in the
service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a
fresher perspective.&#8221; </i>He continued, <i>&#8220;When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less
time to be concerned with ourselves&#8221; </i>(Ibid, p. 2). There are many acts of kindness and words of
compassion that are given when no one but Heavenly Father is aware of the doer or the act.
Nevertheless, He does see and He does know.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my message, I shared something of the hands I love&#8212;my mother&#8217;s, my
father&#8217;s, my grandmother&#8217;s, and my husband&#8217;s. I&#8217;m grateful for the beautiful, tender service that
each of those hands has given to me through the years.</p>
<p>The time may come when we will even be privileged to see our Savior&#8217;s hands, with their
inherent evidence of His supreme love and sacrifice. His sacred nail-scarred hands may then
gently touch ours, as they did those of the Nephite faithful:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and
also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye
may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have
been slain for the sins of the world</i> (3 Nephi 11:14).</p>
<p>Truly then, we will stand, as it were, in holy places. I am grateful to Him for His life of atoning
service&#8212;for showing each of us how better to live, how better to love, and how better to serve
one another. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I appreciate being here on this wonderful campus and to stand before you outstanding faculty
and students. May I recognize the acting President, Robert Wilkes, and commend him for his
service rendered during the interim following the call that came to President Bednar to the
Counsel of the Twelve. I congratulate your new President, Kim Clark, and I know he will enjoy
the privilege of serving here at BYU-Idaho. A call from the Prophet is a call inspired from the
Lord and we are sure he is well qualified for this important commitment. We know this school
will continue to move forward and be recognized as the outstanding university that it is.</p>
<p>This year we celebrate the 175<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the organization of the Church. It is also the 200<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the Prophet Joseph Smith&#8217;s birth on December 23, 1805. As we have occasion to
celebrate his life this year, we will each recognize more fully the contributions he made on
behalf of each of us.</p>
<p>In late May, the Mississippi River runs swift and high past Nauvoo, Illinois, sparkling and
bubbling in the mid-day sunlight. Some eleven miles to the east, across the farmlands away from
the Great Mississippi, stands the small town of Carthage, Illinois. It was here on June 27, 1844,
161 years ago that Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the Restoration, and Hyrum Smith, Patriarch of
the Church were martyred as they gave their individual lives for the sake of their testimony of
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In the fifth hour after noon both suffered multiple shots. It is interesting, and I think even
important, that in Jewish symbolism, the number five denotes sanctification and/ or purification.
Five hours after noonday Joseph and Hyrum died. </p>
<p>Neither brother sought death, but it was not unforeseen. Joseph had forebodings as early as April
1829, when the Lord told him, <i>&#8220;And even if they do unto you even as they have done unto me,
blessed are ye, for you shall dwell with me in glory&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 6:30). Joseph
went to Carthage, in his words, <i>&#8220;like a lamb to the slaughter&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 135:4).
The ruthless death of these brothers was their final witness of the Savior whom they served. As
John Taylor wrote of Joseph:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . Like most of the Lord&#8217;s anointed in ancient times, 
		</i>(he)<i> has sealed his mission
and his works with his own blood. . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 135:3,5)</p>
<p>In sealing his testimony with his blood, he followed the pattern of the Savior. It was in reference
to the Savior, the <i>&#8220;mediator of the new testament,&#8221; </i>that Paul taught, 
		<i>&#8220;For where a testament is,
there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are
dead&#8221; </i>(Hebrews 9:15-17).</p>
<p>Both the Savior and the Prophet Joseph gave their lives in a divine cause. Yet President David O.
McKay once wrote, <i>&#8220;I confess that </i>(Christ&#8217;s shedding His blood) 
		<i>has moved me less than the
realization that in His life He <span style="text-decoration: underline">lived</span> for His fellowmen, and in His death, He triumphed over all
earthly elements&#8221; </i>(Instructor, March 1959).</p>
<p>Similarly, I am more inspired by Joseph Smith&#8217;s 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">life</span> than by his death. Quoting John Taylor
again, <i>&#8220;He left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants
135:3). It is vital to commemorate the Prophet&#8217;s death; we must never forget. Yet his 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">life</span> is a
model of one possessed of mighty faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord asked the Nephites,<i> &#8220;What manner of men ought ye to be?&#8221; 
		</i>He answered his own
question, <i>&#8220;Even as I am&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 27:27). The Lord is our model and guide, or, in Joseph
Smith&#8217;s words, <i>&#8220;the prototype or standard of salvation&#8221; </i>(Lectures on Faith, l7:9).</p>
<p>To be saved is to become like our Savior. We measure our spiritual progress against this
standard. Joseph Smith so faithfully emulated the Master that he too becomes a model, a
standard by which we can gauge our spirituality.</p>
<p>Because Joseph patterned his life after the Savior, whom he knew so well, we can better follow
the Savior&#8217;s pattern. Joseph Smith taught:<i> </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When men begin to live by faith they begin to draw near to God; and when faith is
perfected they are like him; and because he is saved they are saved also; for they
will be in the same situation he is in, because they have come to him; and when he
appears they shall be like him, for they will see him as he is </i>(Lectures on Faith,
7:8).</p>
<p>Nephi wrote, <i>&#8220;Unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the
living God, he cannot be saved&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 31:16). By looking at some of the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Savior&#8217;s</span> divine
attributes we can compare them with Joseph Smith&#8217;s life to see how he imitated his Lord. This
can be a powerful reminder of what we must do to be saved, or to become like the Lord.</p>
<p>The beloved disciple John stated simply, <i>&#8220;God is love&#8221;</i> (1 John 4:8). Kindness and compassion
flowed from The Only Begotten Son&#8217;s soul as pure water from a pristine spring. Sacrifice and
service were as natural to Him as eating and sleeping are to us.</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples of the Lord&#8217;s love is his raising of Lazarus, the brother of Mary and
Martha. Lazarus was sick, and his sisters sent for the Lord, saying,<i> &#8220;he whom thou lovest is sick&#8221;
		</i>(John 11:3). We are also told that, <i>&#8220;Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus&#8221; 
		</i>(John
11:5). Jesus had perfect faith that he could restore Lazarus to health, as he had on numerous
occasions with others. In this instance, he had both temporal and spiritual purposes in mind. He
had tarried two days, and Lazarus had died. He said, <i>&#8220;I am glad for your sakes that I was not
there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him&#8221; </i>(John 11:15). When Jesus
arrived in Judea, Lazarus had lain in the grave for four days. His sisters were sorrowful Martha
said, <i>&#8220;If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.&#8221; </i>But they were also trusting. 
		<i>&#8220;But I
know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.&#8221; 
		</i>Jesus taught
Martha, <i>&#8220;I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live&#8221; </i>(John 11: 21-25). When Jesus arrived at the grave, he saw Mary, Martha, and
others weeping. Seeing their grief, Jesus, the Creator and Redeemer of the world, 
		<i>&#8220;groaned in
the spirit, and was troubled.&#8221; </i>And then, <i>&#8220;Jesus wept&#8221; 
		</i>(John 11:30-35). Lazarus was restored to
his family, and many believed on Jesus.</p>
<p>The scriptures elegantly capture the spirit of this experience. Jesus himself mourned for his
friend Lazarus. He grieved, it seems, to fulfill the law of mourning: <i>&#8220;Thou shalt live together in
love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants
42:45). The Lord deeply felt Mary and Martha&#8217;s anguish along with his own. This gives us hope
that we can indeed, one day, be like him, for we have glimpsed him as he is.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith also taught this principle of love, as he said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity, and ought to be manifested by
those who aspire to be the sons of God. A man filled with the love of God, is not
content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world,
anxious to bless the whole human race</i> (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.
174).</p>
<p>Joseph exemplified the principle of love and said,<i> &#8220;I love your soul, and the souls of the children
of men, and pray and do all I can for the salvation of all&#8221; </i>(Teachings of the Prophet Joseph
Smith, p. 22).</p>
<p>Let us sample the sentiments of some who knew him.</p>
<p>A nineteen-year &#8211;old young man named William Taylor spent two weeks with the Prophet
Joseph. He said of the experience, <i>&#8220;I have never known the same joy and satisfaction in the
companionship of any other person&#8221; </i>(Young Women&#8217;s Journal, 17:548).</p>
<p>It was said of Joseph that, <i>&#8220;He did not like to pass a child, however small, without speaking to
it&#8221; </i>(Juvenile Instructor, 27:109). There are stories of Joseph picking flowers for children, or
drying their tears, or wiping mud from their shoes. Thus, Joseph humbly followed his Savior&#8217;s
lead in loving and blessing little children.</p>
<p>At the funeral of Lorenzo Barnes, he exclaimed, <i>&#8220;O that I had the language of the archangel to
express my feelings once to my friends! But I never expect to in this life&#8221; 
		</i>(History of the Church,
5:360-63).</p>
<p>As mayor of Nauvoo, Joseph was called upon to render judgment on Anthony, a black man, who
had not only been selling liquor in violation of the law, but had been doing it on the Sabbath.
Anthony implored Joseph for leniency, stating that he needed money to buy the freedom of his
child held as a slave in a southern state. Joseph said, <i>&#8220;I am sorry, Anthony, but the law must be
observed, and we will have to impose a fine.&#8221; </i>The next day Joseph gave Anthony a fine horse to
purchase the freedom of the child (Mary Frost Adams in Young Women&#8217;s Journal, 17:538).</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s largeness of soul is legendary. <i>&#8220;It is a duty which every Saint ought to render to his
brethren freely-to always love them, and ever succor them. To be justified before God we must
love one another&#8221; </i>(Teachings of the Prophet Joseph h. p. 76).</p>
<p>To show love in this same spirit is a decision each of you can make today, even at this moment.
President Spencer W. Kimball, another great prophetic example of love, taught: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>One can learn to be loving. If one patterns his life in the mold of love-if he
consciously and determinedly directs his thoughts, controls his acts, and tries to
feel and constantly express his love, he becomes a person of love, for &#8220;As he
thinketh in his heart, so is he&#8221; (Proverbs 23:7)</i> (Teachings of Spencer W.
Kimball, p. 245).</p>
<p>You could, at this moment, think of someone, picture a face, think of a name and connect it with
some act of service you could perform. If you try this, with real intent, you will be inspired. You
will know what to do. Of course, then you must 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">do it.</span> Act on the inspiration you receive, find joy
and make this joy habitual. You will become a loving person after the pattern of the Savior and
Joseph Smith. </p>
<p>Love, then, is an attribute developed by choice, a deliberate decision to follow the Lord. I remind
you, however, that even Jesus experienced obstacles to love, just as we do. For example, he
suffered <i>&#8220;hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer&#8221; 
		</i>(Mosiah 3:7) but he
served anyway. All of the kind, compassionate, loving things the Christ did were done in the
shadow of the cross.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well. Jesus and his
disciples were journeying from Judea to Galilee. The record states that he stopped at Jacob&#8217;s
well, <i>&#8220;being wearied with his journey,&#8221; </i>and his disciples went to buy meat (John 4:6,8). Despite
his weariness, he took time to teach the woman of Samaria some gems of eternal truth.</p>
<p>The record does not state whether he was ever able to rest. Apparently, he did not, because the
Samaritans <i>&#8220;besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. And
many more believed because of his own word&#8221; </i>(John 4:40-41). We can be grateful that he
sacrificed rest for responsibility. His words about living water have refreshed multitudes
throughout centuries.</p>
<p>In a comparable way, all that Joseph Smith did was in the shadow of Carthage. Persecution of
the darkest hue began the first time he accounted his experiences of the First Vision as a mere
youth.</p>
<p>Four months after the Church was organized, he was told, <i>&#8220;Be patient in afflictions, for thou
shalt have many&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 24:8). On the one hand, picture Joseph Smith
ministering to the Saints, directing the affairs of an infant Church, sending missionaries abroad,
building temples, and leading his family.</p>
<p>On the other hand, picture Joseph hiding from false accusers; dealing with contrived legal
charges; enduring unjust imprisonment; hearing news of the murder, rape, and torture of his
beloved Saints; coping the venom of apostates; suffering beatings, attempted poisonings, and
other mob lunacy.</p>
<p>He once wrote, <i>&#8220;My family was kept in a continual state of alarm, not knowing, when I went
from home, that I should ever return again; or what would befall me from day to day&#8221; 
		</i>(Times
and Seasons, 1:3). His burdens were beyond our comprehension. To paraphrase Isaiah, it is a
vexation of the spirit just to hear the report of his troubles (Isaiah 28:19).</p>
<p>The Prophet was not averse to introspection, even when prompted by scurrilous tales. Stories
about Joseph, many of them twisted or blatantly false, circulated constantly. Yet the Prophet
said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When I have heard of a story about me, I sit down and think about it and pray
about it, and I ask myself the question, &#8220;Did I say something or was there
something about my manner to give some basis for that story to start?&#8221; And . . .
often if I think about it long enough I realize I have done something to give that
basis. And there wells up in me a forgiveness of the person who has told that
story, and a resolve that I will never do that thing again</i> (Quoted in Hyrum L. and
Helen Mae Andrus).</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s soul was enlarged through suffering. Too many in our day, even among Church
members, become contracted through trials or ill fate. Rather than forgetting themselves in
service, they withdraw into shells of bitterness and self-pity. All of us have trials and temptations
adapted to our capacity. This is mortality. It does no good to ask, &#8220;Why me?&#8221; Rather we should
concede, &#8220;Why not me?&#8221; and give ourselves to the Savior&#8217;s cause.</p>
<p>President Kimball also had profound counsel in this area: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Only when you lift a burden, God will lift your burden. Divine paradox this! The
man who staggers and falls because his burden is too great can lighten that
burden by taking on the weight of another&#8217;s burden. You get by giving, but your
part of giving must be given first </i>(Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 251).</p>
<p>Both the Lord and the Prophet Joseph gave and gave and gave. Both were ministers of salvation.
Their service and sacrifice extended to all mankind in love.</p>
<p>To Moses, the Lord said, <i>&#8220;For behold, this is my work and my glory-to bring to pass the
immortality and eternal life of man&#8221; </i>(Moses 1:39). The Savior&#8217;s mission was centered on others&#8217;
spiritual and temporal welfare. President J. Reuben Clark said that the Savior left as a heritage
for his Church the carrying on of two great activities: <i>&#8220;Work for the relief of the ills and
sufferings of humanity, and the teaching of the spiritual truths which should bring us back into
the presence of our Heavenly Father&#8221; </i>(Conference Report, Apr. 1937, p.22).</p>
<p>Thus, we see the Savior healing the lepers, giving sight to the blind, causing the infirm to leap to
their feet, and bringing comfort to all who would believe. He set a precedent of service. He went
about relieving the ills and sufferings to which mortals are natural heirs.</p>
<p>In addition, the Savior taught gospel principles. His Sermon on the Mount repeated and
amplified among the Nephites, is unparalleled. His teachings concerning the bread of life and the
living water are transcendent truths. When some of his disciples murmured because of his
teachings, the Savior said, <i>&#8220;The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life&#8221;</i>
(John 6:63). The Lord invited all to believe in him and to be born again, <i>&#8220;changed from their
carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons
and daughters&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 27:25).</p>
<p>Joseph emulated the Savior&#8217;s devotion to the salvation of all mankind. As President of the
Church, he organized the United Order to bless the Saints temporally. He taught: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We must visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction, and we must keep
ourselves unspotted from the world: for such virtues flow from the great fountain
of pure religion, strengthening our faith by adding every good quality that adorns
the children of the blessed Jesus, we can pray in the season of prayer; we can
love our neighbor as ourselves, and be faithful in tribulation, knowing that the
reward of such is greater in the kingdom of heaven. What a consolation! What a
joy! Let me live the life of the righteous, and let my reward be like his! </i>(Teachings
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 76).</p>
<p>He ministered in power to relieve the considerable suffering experienced by the Saints. On the
&#8220;day of God&#8217;s power,&#8221; July 22, 1839, Joseph lay stricken with a vile disease, as were many of
the Saints. Neighbor cared for neighbor, parents for children, and children for parents. There
were so many ill that the caregivers were overwhelmed and exhausted. Moved upon by the
Spirit, Joseph rose from his sick bed and went across the river to Montrose, Iowa. Dozens were
immediately healed on that day. He states in his journal, <i>&#8220;Many of the sick were this day raised
up by the power of God&#8221; </i>(History of the Church 4:3)</p>
<p>He also followed the Savior in teaching the gospel of salvation. Through Joseph were revealed
startling yet comforting and fascinating doctrines. The Lord told him, <i>&#8220;This generation shall
have my word through you&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 5:10). In 1841 the Prophet told the
brethren that <i>&#8220;the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone
of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other
book&#8221; </i>(HC 4:461). Plain and precious truths were restored through Joseph Smith&#8217;s inspired
translation of sacred records, bringing generations to an understanding of their Lord and Savior.
We measure our fidelity to God&#8217;s word through the principles revealed in the Book of Mormon.
Who besides Joseph has offered the world such a saving book? </p>
<p>He set doctrinal precedents that established the basis for God&#8217;s Kingdom on earth. We measure
our fidelity to God&#8217;s word through Joseph Smith&#8217;s teachings. </p>
<p>Who in this dispensation has surpassed the King Follet Discourse, for example? Where can we
find a greater statement on faith than the Lectures on Faith, which were prepared under his
tutelage? Who has mastered the ordinances and principles of temple worship better than he
through whom the keys were restored? Joseph Smith was indeed, a teacher of supernal truths.
Brigham Young said of him:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The excellency of the glory of the character of brother Joseph Smith was that he
could reduce heavenly things to the understanding of the finite. When he
preached to the people . . . he reduced his teachings to the capacity of every man,
woman, and child, making them as plain as a well-defined pathway </i>(Journal of
Discourses, 8:206).</p>
<p>We too are to minister to the needs and wants of others, both temporally and spiritually. Joseph
Smith taught, <i>&#8220;Let the Saints remember that great things depend on their individual exertion,
and that they are called to be co-workers with us and the Holy Spirit in accomplishing the great
work of the last days&#8221; </i>(Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp.178-79).</p>
<p>President Gordon Hinckley taught us our responsibility: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We are all in this great endeavor together. We are here to assist our Father in
His work and His glory, &#8220;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of
man&#8221; (Moses 1:39). Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility
as is my obligation in my sphere. No calling in this church is small or of little
consequence. All of us in the pursuit of our duty touch the lives of others. To each
of us in our respective responsibilities the Lord has said: &#8220;Wherefore, be faithful;
stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the
hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees&#8221; (Doctrine and
Covenants 81:5) </i>(&#8220;This Is the Work of the Master,&#8221; Ensign, May 1995, p. 71).</p>
<p>Your life, as President Stephen L. Richards used to say, is a mission, not a career. If you are
wise, you will prepare for a life of service. </p>
<p>One reason for the Prophet&#8217;s serenity in distress was his total, unflinching commitment to God&#8217;s
will. A dictionary definition of faith is &#8220;belief and trust in and loyalty in God.&#8221; Joseph Smith
loved God with a fervor born of personal experience, for he had seen him. He knew his power
and glory. His trust was complete; his loyalty was unquestioning.</p>
<p>Jesus was the greatest person ever to walk this earth. He had infinitely greater wisdom and
power than any man. He had power over life and death. He could command the elements. Yet he
said, <i>&#8220;I can of mine own self do nothing . . . because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the
Father which hath sent me&#8221; </i>(John 5:30). </p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith saw in vision <i>&#8220;the hosts of the dead . . . who had offered sacrifice in
the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 138:11-13).
How can our sacrifices be in the similitude of the Savior&#8217;s great infinite and eternal sacrifice?
Very simply, we can submit our wills to the Father&#8217;s. Rather than persisting in our 
		<i>&#8220;carnal wills
and desires&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 16:11), our wills, like the<i> &#8220;will of the Son,&#8221; 
		</i>should be <i>&#8220;swallowed up in
the will of the Father&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 15:7). This is how Christ lived, and this is how Joseph Smith
lived. Such submission to God led ultimately to death. Joseph&#8217;s martyrdom was indeed in
similitude of the Lord&#8217;s great sacrifice, for he went where he was sent and did what he did
knowing full well where it would lead.</p>
<p>Brigham Young said, &#8220;I heard Joseph say many times, <i>&#8220;I shall not live until I am forty years of
age&#8221; </i>(Discourses of Brigham Young, p.715). Yet Joseph also stated confidently, 
		<i>&#8220;God will
always protect me until my mission is fulfilled&#8221; </i>(Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.366)</p>
<p>The chance that you and I will be called upon to die for our convictions is remote. How then can
we offer a sacrifice &#8220;in similitude&#8221; of the great sacrifice of the Son of God? President Marion G.
Romney said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I decided in my youth that for me the best approach to the solution of problems
and the resolving of questions would be to proceed as Jesus proceeded: foster an
earnest desire to do the Lord&#8217;s will; familiarize myself with what the Lord has
revealed on the matters involved; pray with diligence and faith for an inspired
understanding of his will and the courage to do it </i>(Marion G. Romney, &#8220;What
Would Jesus Do?&#8221; The New Era, Sept. 1971, pp 4-6).</p>
<p>The Savior concluded his mortal life as he began it-in purity and innocence. Judas painfully
recognized that he had <i>&#8220;betrayed the innocent blood&#8221;</i> (Matthew 27:4), and Pilate called the Lord
a <i>&#8220;just person&#8221;</i> (Matthew 27:24). Jesus was a lamb without spot or blemish. He was the sinless
Son of God. And he chose to die at the hands of evil men so that salvation could come to all who
believe and obey.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith also concluded his life as it began, humble and obedient. He had fulfilled his
mission. He said, <i>&#8220;I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall
die innocent&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 135:4). Joseph submitted to death at the hands of evil
men so that salvation could come to all who believe and obey. </p>
<p>By personally following Joseph&#8217;s example, we will also follow the example of the Son of God,
who was Joseph&#8217;s model. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Prophet Joseph Smith, of course, was not a perfect man. There has been only
one such-Jesus Christ. But Joseph Smith was a special witness for Jesus Christ.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We do not, as some occasionally charge, worship Joseph Smith, nor place him on
a par with Jesus. But we do venerate him, remembering, hopefully, that the
highest and best form of veneration is emulation</i> (The Prophet Joseph Smith:
Spiritual Statesman&#8221;, Annual Joseph Smith Memorial Sermons, Logan, Utah,
January 1975, p. 12).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the
salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
135:3).</p>
<p>Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah. Jesus anointed that prophet and seer! Joseph
knew Jesus. He communed with him in our behalf. He was a chosen vessel of the Lord to whom
angels ministered, thus preparing <i>&#8220;the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that
the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts&#8221; </i>(Moroni 7:29-32).</p>
<p>May we also, come to know the Lord, commune with him, and learn to be like him by showing:
love, compassion, faith, service and sacrifice. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>When President Hall called me to meet him in his office and &#8220;invited&#8221; me to speak at a
devotional, I was very surprised &#8211; panicked actually, and thought of every way possible to
refuse. As I contemplated this invitation while driving home that afternoon, and convincing
myself that &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t do this task,&#8221; the thought came to me, &#8220;Of course I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; A
calm, reassuring feeling came upon me that this opportunity was not about me, but rather about
the message the Lord would have you hear through &#8220;me&#8221; and he would bless me. Brother Hall
insisted that this would be a &#8220;great growing experience&#8221; for me and since I am only 5&#8217;3&#8221; tall, I
am really excited for this opportunity to &#8220;grow&#8221; with you today.</p>
<p>Those of you who know me, realize what a difficult task this is for me today. I prefer to be the
&#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; person, making sure things run smoothly. Not only is my wonderful husband
a GREAT teacher here on campus in the Geology Department, but he has a tremendous gift for
speaking and I would very gladly defer to him today. I told him if I happen to pass out or hyper-ventilate, he could take over for me. 
		</p>
<p>If you listen closely to the many devotionals given here on campus, you will hear an open
invitation for the Holy Ghost to be present. I also invite the Holy Spirit to be in attendance this
afternoon and pray that you will have ears to hear and hearts open and receptive to my message
today and that you will ponder on what the Lord would have you learn during our time together. 
		</p>
<p>During the past few months as I have been preparing this talk, I have been so grateful to our
Heavenly Father for the promptings that have come and the &#8220;fine-tuning&#8221; I have been privileged
to experience as I have listened more intently to talks and lessons heard in various meetings and
paid greater attention to what I have read in the scriptures. Sometimes it is hard to remember all
we read and study but it&#8217;s our job to put the information in, and the Holy Ghost&#8217;s job to pull it
out when needed. I pray that will be the case here today. I am also very grateful to you students
who have come up to me and said, &#8220;Sister Lovell, I see you are speaking at Devotional. I just
want you to know that I am praying for you.&#8221; Thank you, thank you, thank you for your prayers.
I have felt them and been strengthened in my preparation.</p>
<p>First, I want to share with you my love for BYU-Idaho. I was a student here at Ricks College 30
years ago. I loved being here on this campus attending classes, working in the Library, living in
an apartment with five other girls, and being an active participant in all that was happening here.
After I graduated with my associate degree, I continued to work in the library while pondering
where to go next. (This may sound familiar to some of you here today.) </p>
<p>I was in the library working one day, when I met my husband. He had just returned from serving
a mission, enrolled in a communications class, and was checking out a book from the reserve
area at the circulation counter when we met. I always tease him that he came in to &#8220;check out a
book and checked me out instead.&#8221; We dated through the fall semester, married at the break in
December (as many of you have done), and while Brother Lovell continued his schooling in
Geology here on campus, I worked as a secretary in the Athletics Department. </p>
<p>After Brother Lovell graduated from Ricks College, we attended the University of Utah and later
BYU. We then ventured off to Houston, Texas with our four small children to work for an oil
company. We loved the eight years we spent in Houston, living in the &#8220;mission field&#8221;, having
great &#8220;growing experiences&#8221; working and serving in the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;southern Texas&#8221; Kingdom and
adding two additional children to our family. </p>
<p>With a chance to return to the family farm in Ririe and raise our six children in the same
environment and setting we had been raised, we returned to Idaho. We marvel at the &#8220;tender
mercies&#8221; of our Heavenly Father in blessing us with the opportunities we have had being away
and new opportunities to be back in Idaho these past 15 years. The many lessons learned while
being away have truly blessed our lives and helped prepare us to be here at BYU-Idaho. As we
come to campus together each day, we truly cherish the opportunity of being employed here. 
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">An Instrument in the Hands of the Lord</span></p>
<p>As I prayed for inspiration as to what the Lord would have me teach you today, I received a very
strong impression of the topic, &#8220;An Instrument in the Hands of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the past 10 years while working on campus, I have watched and learned a great deal from the
students and employees. While working in the Austin building, I marveled at the amazing
creations and works of art the welding students created with their torches &#8211; projects such as
trailers, bakers racks, and even a delicate rose; engineering students used techniques, skills, and
modeling tools to solve problems; automotive students disassembled vehicles and with tools and
equipment reassembled them to a proper working order; students studying architecture and
construction management learned to draw plans, design buildings, and build homes; students
studying electronics worked with circuit boards and various tools as they learned valuable skills
for employment as technicians. </p>
<p>Coming to work in the Activities Program has shown me another tool or instrument &#8211; that of
developing one another here on our campus. It has been an amazing experience to work with the
student officers and directors each semester. They are also using skills and techniques as they
invite other students on campus to &#8220;act&#8221;, &#8220;get involved&#8221;, &#8220;grow&#8221;, and enhance their Academic
experience through the various opportunities in the Activities Program. </p>
<p>Whether in Academics, Activities, or other areas of campus, as students each of you require
various instruments, tools, and knowledge specific to your area of expertise to accomplish what
is needed for a grade or to be successful. </p>
<p>Right now, you have different career interests, different ward callings, and different talents. You
will travel many different paths in life. Each of you will progress at a different rate. There are,
and will be in the future, many different ways for each of you to serve our Heavenly Father and
to be the most effective instrument you can be in building his Kingdom here on the earth.</p>
<p>I am sure there are many returned missionaries here today who have experienced the sweet joy
of being an instrument in the hands of the Lord similar to what Ammon and his brothers must
have felt in bringing the knowledge of Christ to the Lamanites. In Alma 26, verse 3 we read:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest
abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of
God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">we have
been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work</span>
</i>(Alma
26:3, emphasis added)<i>.</i></p>
<p>As many of you accept internship assignments and then jobs around the world, you too will &#8220;be
made instruments in the hands of God&#8221; in bringing the knowledge of Christ to those you come in
contact with. </p>
<p>During this past winter semester, it was an exciting time for our daughter, Dianna, along with 10
other interns from campus, who filled accounting internship assignments in New York with a top
accounting firm. Eyes were opened and hearts were touched as these interns demonstrated that
BYU-Idaho students are leaders, knowledgeable, and as worthy of employment as other
prominent universities across the United States. In the devotional address, &#8220;A Steady Upward
Course&#8221;, Elder Eyring shared the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You can imagine the joy of an employer or a Church leader when such a graduate
arrives. The graduates will be at personal peace by having kept the
commandments. They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to
learn. They will have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more
of what money can buy. Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become&#8212;and this is
a prophesy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly&#8212;those graduates of
BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around
them and to add value wherever they serve </i>(&#8220;A Steady Upward Course,&#8221; BYU-Idaho Devotional Address, September 18, 2001, 11).</p>
<p>As you are hired by various companies throughout the world, you will become &#8220;instruments in
the hands of the Lord&#8221; not only at the workplace but in the wards and stakes of the church as you
help build the Kingdom of God. </p>
<p>In every aspect of our lives, the Lord needs us to embrace our eternal callings, and look for ways
to serve others as we help build the Kingdom. We have come to earth precisely when we were
needed. We must be in tune to the promptings of the spirit to know when, where, and how the
Lord can use us as his instruments.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain
assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks.
While we do not now remember the particulars, this does not alter the glorious
reality of what we once agreed to. </i>[We]<i> are accountable for those things which
long ago were expected of </i>[us]<i> </i>(&#8220;The Role of Righteous Women,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign,
</i>November 1979, 102).</p>
<p>Our assignment is not an easy one. There are times when we may feel overwhelmed or
inadequate and that we have been asked to deal with impossible tasks, that too much is asked of
us. So how do we do it? With all that is happening in our busy lives, how do we become the most
effective instruments we can be in the hands of the Lord?</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father, in his infinite wisdom, does not allow us to work alone. The Holy Ghost
will guide us, and prayers will be answered. We have been given many attributes which will help
us do what we have been sent here to do and I would like to share four with you today. 
		</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">1) First, we need to have Faith.</span>
</p>
<p>Faith that the Lord can help us, and will help us. From the moment of his conversion, John
Taylor was committed to giving his all to the Lord&#8217;s work. Through his decades of service, he
placed his trust in the Lord, knowing that if he served faithfully, the Lord would sustain him and
enable him to accomplish His will. On one occasion when Elder Taylor was preaching the gospel
on the Isle of Man near England, he had arranged for the printing of some tracts he had written in
response to the false accusations against the Church and the Prophet Joseph Smith. However, the
printer refused to deliver the tracts until he was paid in full. Anxious to distribute the tracts as
soon as possible, Elder Taylor prayed to the Lord for help, which was soon given. 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>A few minutes after his prayer was offered, a young man came to the door, and
upon being invited to enter handed Elder Taylor an envelope and walked out. The
young man was unknown to him. The envelope contained some money and a little
note which read: &#8216;The laborer is worthy of his hire,&#8217; and no signature was placed
thereon. A few minutes later a poor woman engaged as a fish vendor came to the
house and offered a little money to assist him in his ministerial labors. He told
her there was plenty of money in the world and he did not wish to take her money.
She insisted that the Lord would bless her the more and she would be happier if
he would accept, whereupon he received the offering, and to his surprise the poor
woman&#8217;s mite, added to what the young man had given him, made exactly the
amount sufficient to pay the printer the balance due him </i>(Andrew Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 4 vols. (1901-36), 1:16).<i><sup>
</sup></i></p>
<p>As with John Taylor, we must ask in faith for inspiration to know what we are to do. Answers
will come when the Lord is sure that we will act on the promptings. Each challenge and brush
with adversity strengthens our faith and &#8220;grows&#8221; us to prepare us for the next experience or
challenge. Each time our faith is stretched, our testimony of the Savior, Jesus Christ, increases
and we will be able to do what we have been sent here to do.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">2) We must have Charity &#8211; The Pure Love of Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>As we become increasingly more pure &#8211; in thought, word, deed, and motive &#8211; we will eventually
be led to those needing our help, those we can care for, guide, love, and teach. When we have the
&#8220;pure love of Christ&#8221; we stop worrying about how the world sees us and we are free to focus our
attention on others. </p>
<p>Elder Eyring instructed that, <i>&#8220;You are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify
becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands&#8221;</i> (&#8220;Rise to Your Call,&#8221;
Ensign, November 2002, 76). </p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father knows us and he knows the needs of his children. He works through us,
giving us those promptings to help one another. When we act on those promptings, we are
allowed to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord and a way will be opened to serve as his
instrument to accomplish the task. President Heber J. Grant shared the following incident: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>One day while sitting in my office an impression came to me to go to Sister Emily
Woodmansee and loan her fifty dollars. I did so, and found that she was in
absolute need of the necessities of life . . . There is nothing I desire more than to
have my mind susceptible to impressions of this kind </i>(Letters from Heber J. Grant
to N.L. Nelson, 1 April 1914, Family and Church History Department Archives,
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).</p>
<p>President Grant goes on to say:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That every kind word spoken gives you greater ability to speak another. Every act
of assistance rendered by you, through the knowledge that you possess, to aid one
of your fellows, gives you greater ability to aid the next one. Good acts grow
upon a person. I have sometimes thought that many men, judging from their utter
lack of kindness and of a disposition to aid others, imagined that if they were to
say or do a kind thing, it would destroy their capacity to perform a kind act or say
a kind word in the future. If you have a granary full of grain, and you give away a
sack or two, there remain that many less in your granary, but if you perform a
kind act or add words of encouragement to one in distress, who is struggling
along in the battle of life, the greater is your capacity to do this in the future.
Don&#8217;t go through life with your lips sealed against words of kindness and
encouragement, nor your hearts sealed against performing labors for another.
Make a motto in life: always try and assist someone else to carry his burden
</i>(&#8220;Have a Purpose in Life,&#8221; Improvement Era, February 1902, 289-90).</p>
<p>One of the best ways to be an example of the Pure Love of Christ is in our Visiting Teaching and
Home Teaching. In one of our recent devotional messages, I appreciated hearing that these are
not &#8220;callings&#8221;, but rather &#8220;assignments&#8221;. When asked to accept an assignment to be a Visiting
Teacher or a Home Teacher are we willing to do so? By not accepting and striving to serve those
we are assigned to visit, nurture, and love we are in essence telling our Heavenly Father, &#8220;No
thanks . . . I don&#8217;t want those blessings right now.&#8221; We can be instruments in the hands of the
Lord as we follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost to know how to serve those &#8220;assigned&#8221; to
us. </p>
<p>A sweet sister and friend in our ward recently lost her mother-in-law. I had visited with her on
several occasions as funeral plans were being prepared, but at work one afternoon the day before
the funeral, I had the distinct impression to give her a call. I was working on a project that I
wanted to finish and tried to push the thought away. But the prompting came again, and I
stopped, dialed her number and had a very special visit with her over the phone. She later told
me that she was feeling especially low and just needed someone to talk to. </p>
<p>I think these are the kinds of &#8220;promptings&#8221; the Lord gives us quite often, if we have our &#8220;ears
tuned&#8221; to hear. Our Heavenly Father knows each one of us and gives us that &#8220;comforting hug&#8221;
through one of his children who are his &#8220;instruments&#8221; here on the earth. I would encourage you
to record these special occasions in your journals to reference and share with your posterity at a
future time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">3) We need to Know Who We Are</span>.</p>
<p>None of us came to this earth to gain our worth; we brought it with us. President Wilford
Woodruff said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Lord has chosen a small number of choice spirits of sons and daughters out
of all the creations of God, who are to inherit this earth; and this company of
choice spirits have been kept in the spirit world for six thousand years to come
forth in the last days . . . to build . . . up and to defend the Kingdom of God 
		</i>(Our
Lineage [course of study for genealogy classes, 1933], pt. 1, p. 4).</p>
<p>There is not a man or woman in this Church who doesn&#8217;t have a specific mission to perform in
helping build up the Kingdom of God. It is humbling to think that you are here now, at this time,
for a specific purpose. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Believe in yourself. Believe in your capacity to do great and good and worthwhile
things. Believe in the nature within you, the divine nature, that you are in very
deed a son or daughter of the living God. There is something of divinity within
you, something that stands high and tall and noble. Get above the dirt and the
filth of the earth and walk on a higher plane with your heads up, believing in
yourselves and in your capacity to act for good in the world and make a
difference</i> (Stand a Little Taller, 160).</p>
<p>My father-in-law, Rendon Lovell, served as a Stake Patriarch in the Ririe Stake for a number of
years. I had the wonderful blessing and opportunity to assist my mother-in-law in transcribing
the blessings given to the youth in our stake. He gave close to 600 blessings during the time he
served. I could not specifically tell you what any one of them said today, but I can testify to you
that this &#8220;army of valiant young people from the Ririe Stake&#8221; includes some of the most
trustworthy of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s children. So it is with stakes throughout the world as
patriarchal blessings are given. I challenge you to read, study, and ponder your blessings to know
who you are and where the Lord needs you to be his instrument in building the Kingdom. 
		</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">4) We need to have Courage.</span>
</p>
<p>The courage to be obedient and fearless; the courage to stand alone if need be; the courage to
open our mouths when prompted; the courage to be ready to &#8220;act&#8221; when called upon to be an
instrument in the hands of the Lord. </p>
<p>In General Conference, October 1991, then first counselor in the first presidency, Gordon B.
Hinckley taught that in the fall of 1856, the saints who were trapped and dying along the trail
were at least four hundred miles from their destination. When Brigham Young was finally made
aware of what was happening, the next morning, on the Sabbath, he said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I will now give this people the subject and the text for the Elders who may speak .
. . It is this. On the 5th day of October, 1856, many of our brethren and sisters are
on the plains with handcarts, and probably many are now seven hundred miles
from this place, and they must be brought here, we must send assistance to them.
The text will be, &#8220;to get them here.&#8221; That is my religion; that is the dictation of
the Holy Ghost that I possess. It is to save the people . . . I shall call upon the
Bishops this day. I shall not wait until tomorrow, nor until the next day, for 60
good mule teams and 12 or 15 wagons. I do not want to send oxen. I want good
horses and mules. They are in this Territory, and we must have them. Also 12 tons
of flour and 40 good teamsters, besides those that drive the teams&#8230;I will tell you
all that your faith, religion, and profession of religion, will never save one soul of
you in the Celestial Kingdom of our God, unless you carry out just such
principles as I am now teaching you. Go and bring in those people now on the
plains </i>(<i>Handcarts to Zion,</i> Glendale, Calif.: Arthur H. Clark Co., 1960, pp.
120&#8211;21).</p>
<p>President Hinckley goes on to state: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now, I am grateful that today none of our people are stranded on the Wyoming
highlands. But I know that all about us there are many who are in need of help
and who are deserving of rescue. Our mission in life, as followers of the Lord
Jesus Christ, must be a mission of saving . . . It is not with those on the high
plains of Wyoming that we need be concerned today. It is with many immediately
around us, in our families, in our wards and stakes, in our neighborhoods, and
communities . . . Let us never forget that we have a marvelous heritage received
from great and courageous people who endured unimaginable suffering and
demonstrated unbelievable courage for the cause they loved. You and I know
what we should do. God help us to do it when it needs to be done </i>(&#8220;Our Mission
of Saving&#8221;, Ensign, November 1991, 52).</p>
<p>Just as those earlier saints who helped bring their brothers and sisters to Salt Lake, we too can be
instruments in the Lord&#8217;s hands to bring about his purposes among his children today. As we
teach and reach out to others, Heavenly Father will multiply and magnify our efforts to bless the
lives of his children.</p>
<p>In Mark 8:23 it reads, <i>&#8220;And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town</i>.&#8221; 
		</p>
<p>Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley shares this thought:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>How simple it is, really, to extend a kindness when we see the need. Jesus set the
example on many occasions. He led the blind man out of the town. Just a small
kindness, but a powerful example. God helps us to recognize the opportunities we
have every day to touch lives in small and simple ways </i>(<i>Small and Simple Things</i>,
Marjorie Pay Hinckley, 2003, pp.98-99).</p>
<p>Recently, Brother Lovell had the opportunity to travel to Paraguay with a group from our
campus as part of a humanitarian effort. Through working with the missionary couple there, they
received word of items to bring that would be so appreciated by sweet members of the Nivalcle
tribe, who have little to nothing. There was a devastating flood a few years back that destroyed a
large part of their town, resulting in many moving closer to the larger towns of the area and
establishing a new settlement. While there are a few families who have made some economic
progress, most are struggling with average earnings of less than the equivalent of $250 dollars
per year. </p>
<p>One of the suggestions was for the group to bring some sports equipment for the children to play
with&#8212;soccer balls preferably, but anything that could be found would be greatly appreciated.
We contacted Trent Shippen and some of the coaches in the Activities Sports area and they
willingly gave some equipment. I happened to mention what was taking place to Brother Shaum
one day and the next morning he excitedly showed me the campus surplus sale with listings for
basketballs, volleyballs, and soccer balls. I quickly called Gayle Weatherston at the surplus
office and explained what was needed, being hopeful that these items were still available. She in
turn contacted Larry Wickham at Continuing Education whose office placed the items on the
surplus list. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brother Lovell wrote an e-mail to Brother Wickham explaining the need for this
equipment for the children in Paraguay and before the end of the day; he had more basketballs,
baseballs, soccer balls, footballs donated than he could take with him. A coincidence? I don&#8217;t
think so. As I marveled at the sequence of what had taken place, it occurred to me, that yes, we
could have gone and purchased this equipment or even collected funds to purchase what could
be taken to Paraguay, but these employees were allowed to play a role as &#8220;an instrument in the
hands of the Lord&#8221; to bless the lives of His children in a far-away village in Paraguay. 
		</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales taught, <i>&#8220;We came to this life with a purpose and that the greatest joy we
will receive will be those acts of love and service that we do for others . . . There is none too
great to need the help of others. There is none so great that he can &#8216;do it alone&#8217;&#8221;

It Alone,&#8221; Ensign, November 1975, 93).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Building the Kingdom</span></p>
<p>In JST, Matthew 6:38 we read, <i>&#8220;Seek ye first to build up the Kingdom of God, and to establish
his righteousness&#8221; </i>(JST, Matthew 6:38).</p>
<p>We need to be valiant in our commitment to build up Zion. We are children of our Heavenly
Father and made covenants at the time of our baptism as we read in Mosiah 18:8-11:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his
people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that
stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all
things, and in all places . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in
the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a
covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he
may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for
joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</i></p>
<p>It really is possible to do what we came here to do and do it with &#8220;joy&#8221;. There is no greater joy
and no greater work than helping the Lord with His work, with being instruments in his hands.
We are part of the true, restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We have a work to do. As we find ways
to serve in our Heavenly Father&#8217;s Kingdom, our testimony grows, and we are strengthened to
fulfill our divine mission. </p>
<p>Just before Christmas, Brother Lovell and I were very content serving in the nursery in our ward.
We loved it!! We were able to teach the gospel to these sweet spirits through short little lessons
and songs. The children were a sweet reminder of our own grandchildren and Brother Lovell
enjoyed the much relaxed pace of the nursery after serving as the bishop of our ward &#8211; plus there
was the added bonus of &#8220;snack-time&#8221;!! </p>
<p>I was grateful to the Lord for the blessing of serving with my husband. Heavenly Father decided
to continue &#8220;growing us&#8221; as Brother Lovell was called to serve on the High Council and I was
invited to serve as our ward Relief Society President. During the past few months, I have so
appreciated the many acts of kindness and service the sisters in our ward have shown to others.
So it is with each of you in your respective callings. </p>
<p>President Hinckley stated: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>No calling in this church is . . . of little consequence. All of us in the pursuit of our
duty touch the lives of others . . . Whatever your calling, it is as fraught with the
same kind of opportunity to accomplish good as is mine . . . Our work is to go
about doing good as did </i>[the Master]<i> </i>(&#8220;This Is the Work of the Master,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign,</i>
May 1995, 71).</p>
<p>Remember that the work you are doing, the calling that you have is the Lord&#8217;s work and when
we are on the Lord&#8217;s errand, we are entitled to the Lord&#8217;s help. Be prayerful as you seek
guidance and direction from the Lord as you serve in his Kingdom.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Right Place at the Right Time</span></p>
<p>Earlier, I told you of a time when John Taylor was prompted to help Sister Emily Woodmansee
by giving her $50. Let me share with you the rest of her story. </p>
<p>When Emily was 12 years old she heard LDS missionaries preaching the gospel in her
neighborhood and quickly became convinced of the truth of their words. Emily&#8217;s family and
friends were less than thrilled with her enthusiasm for the Church. She was told by her father that
if she joined the Church she would not be welcome in their home. Despite this opposition Emily
was baptized when she was 20 years old and immediately left England for the United States with
her older sister, Julia, who had also converted. Upon their arrival in America, Emily and Julia
traveled from New York to Iowa where they joined a handcart company to make the Mormon
trek west to Utah. Their company experienced many difficult trials and may not have made it to
Utah except for the timely rescuers sent from Salt Lake City by Brigham Young. 
		</p>
<p>Emily entered into the covenant of plural marriage in 1857 in Salt Lake City. The couple had one
child before her husband left on a mission for the Church. He had been gone three years when
Emily received a message from him stating that he would not be returning to Utah and severed
their relationship. Following this difficult trial Emily married Joseph Woodmansee in 1864 in
Salt Lake City and bore him eight children&#8230;Emily was well-known for her abilities as a poet.
Many of her poems were published in various magazines, journals, and used as text in our
hymnbook (http://marialouisapickett.homestead.com/Emily_Hill_Mills_Woodmansee.htm).</p>
<p>She wrote the text for one of my favorite hymns, &#8220;As Sisters in Zion&#8221;. If we change the word
&#8220;sisters&#8221; to &#8220;members&#8221;, this song is very applicable to all of us as we strive to be &#8220;instruments in
the hands of the Lord&#8221; in building his Kingdom.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>1. As </i>[members]<i> in Zion, we&#8217;ll all work together;<br />The blessings of God on our labors we&#8217;ll seek.<br />We&#8217;ll build up his Kingdom with earnest endeavor;<br />We&#8217;ll comfort the weary and strengthen the weak.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>2. The errand of angels is given to 
		</i>[members]<i>;<br />And this is a gift that, as</i> [members]<i>, we claim:<br />To do whatsoever is gentle and human,<br />To cheer and to bless in humanity&#8217;s name.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>3. How vast is our purpose, how broad is our mission,<br />If we but fulfill it in spirit and deed.<br />Oh, naught but the Spirit&#8217;s divinest tuition<br />Can give us the wisdom to truly succeed</i> (&#8220;As Sisters in Zion&#8221;, Hymnbook, 309). 
		</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, as with Emily Woodmansee, the Lord truly knows each of us,
blesses us abundantly, and works through us to further his work in the Kingdom. When we
moved to Texas 23 years ago, I never expected to return to Idaho, let alone be employed at Ricks
College, now BYU-Idaho, and I certainly never expected to be asked to speak at a Devotional.
As you prepare now to chart your course, if you never leave the dock, you will never know
where the Lord will use you as his instruments in building the Kingdom. </p>
<p>While serving here in the Rexburg Kingdom, Elder Bednar truly was an instrument in the hands
of the Lord at the right time and here in the right place to implement that which the Lord desired
for this university. President Wilkes has kept us on a steady course while preparations were
made for our next president. Now during this exciting time of change on our campus with the
coming of President Clark, he too will be an &#8220;instrument in the hands of the Lord&#8221; as he fulfills
his assignment and makes innovative contributions here at BYU-Idaho. </p>
<p>It is my prayer that each of you will have the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">faith</span> to know what the Lord would have you do;
the <span style="text-decoration: underline">pure love of Christ </span>to serve others; the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">knowledge</span> of who you truly are and why you are here
at this time and place; the <span style="text-decoration: underline">courage</span> to be obedient to &#8220;act&#8221; and &#8220;speak&#8221; when prompted; for when
we do these things, we are better able to be instruments in the hands of the Lord in building his
Kingdom. </p>
<p>I leave you my testimony that I know that our Heavenly Father truly hears and answers prayers
and works through each of us to build his Kingdom. I know our Savior lives; I know the Prophet
Joseph Smith was indeed an instrument in the hands of the Lord to restore the Gospel to the
earth; I know that President Gordon B. Hinckley is the true prophet, the instrument of the Lord
to serve at this time in building the Kingdom. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When I learned that you bring your scriptures to devotionals, the promise of the Lord came to
mind that by studying the scriptures <i>&#8220;you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my
words&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 18:36). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">He also said, <i>&#8220;What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken . . . Whether by mine own voice or by
the voice of my servants, it is the same&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 1:38). 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Do we realize what marvelous blessings only we enjoy? No one else in all the world can claim
the blessing of hearing the voice of the Risen Lord through the scriptures of the Restoration and
from the lips of His living prophets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When we accept and live the gospel, we have a great desire to change and improve our character.
We want to be like the Master, and love that which the Lord loves. The Lord loves the scriptures
and he loves His prophets. His earthly ministry was scripturally-based in two wonderful ways.
He taught from the recorded word of God and He was the Word of God and the greatest of all the
prophets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">John Taylor&#8217;s inspired statement after the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his
brother Hyrum emphasized the importance of the scriptures of the Restoration to the work of this
final dispensation: <i>&#8220;The reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and
this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century
to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 135:6). I
suggest you read President Boyd K. Packer&#8217;s Conference addresses in the November 1982, and
May 1990 Ensigns to see the Lord&#8217;s hand in bringing forth the new Latter-day Saint Edition of
the scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">May we study, listen, and hear the voice of the Good Shepherd 
		<i>&#8220;who giveth his life for his
sheep&#8221; </i>and who said <i>&#8220;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me&#8221; 
		</i>(John
10:11, 27). We do hear His voice by the Spirit as we study and ponder the scriptures and as we
heed the counsel of the living prophets. I pray that the scriptures may bring us closer to Him and
increase our capacity to love one another as He has loved us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I will speak today about charity which 
		<i>&#8220;is the pure love of Christ&#8221; </i>(Moroni 7:47). The charity
about which I speak is not restricted to helping the needy or being kind. The charity of which I
speak is a divine love which fills the heart and soul and moves one to obey and act and serve and
love as Jesus did. Having charity means we love those things which the Lord loves with a pure
and perfect love. I will rely on the scriptures and the words of the prophets to help us understand
what charity is, and how we can develop it in our own lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Love is a divine attribute of God. Throughout His earthly ministry, Jesus testified that 
		<i>&#8220;my
Father is greater than I&#8221; </i>(John 14:28) and that He did the things He saw His Father do.
Consequently, Jesus developed His pure love through the loving example and tutelage of
Heavenly Father. </span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my
Father&#8217;s commandments, and abide in his love </i>(John 15:9-10). </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We are commanded to do the same because God loves all His children and desires their eternal
happiness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The gospel of Jesus Christ empowers us, by ordinances, gifts, and obedience, to become perfect
in character and holy as the Father and the Son are holy. This process is sometimes called the
&#8220;power of godliness&#8221;. Possessing charity and having it possess us is an essential attribute of the
divine nature. It is a spiritual gift, a heavenly endowment. The essence of the Father&#8217;s plan of
salvation and eternal happiness is the development of a godly character in His children. To
understand what that means we must first consider the Father&#8217;s divine love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When Phillip asked the Lord to 
		<i>&#8220;shew us the Father&#8221;</i> Jesus said <i>&#8220;he that hath seen me hath seen
the Father&#8221; </i>(John 14:8-9). The Beloved Son&#8217;s perfect life and ministry among men revealed
God&#8217;s divine nature, holy character and His perfect love to the Israelites and to us. Jesus said, 
		<i>&#8220;I
speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works&#8221; 
		</i>(John 14:10).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As God is endless and eternal so 
		<i>&#8220;God is love&#8221; </i>(1 John 4:16). His eternal plan is an expression
of the perfect love of Heavenly Father for His children.<i> &#8220;For God so loved the world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life&#8221;</i> (John 3:16).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We learn from the scriptures that the love of parents for their children is sometimes like a two-edged sword which brings both great joy and intense sorrow. That is especially true when agency
is involved. We see evidence of that in Father Lehi&#8217;s family. We also see the evidence of God&#8217;s
love for His children as His plan unfolded in mortality. Enoch beheld the loving God of heaven
weeping because of the wickedness and rebellion of His wayward children (Moses 7:28, 37).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Elder Melvin J. Ballard helped us to understand the personal anguish and great love of God as
He watched His Beloved Son suffer and atone: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Father looked on with great grief and agony over His Beloved Son, until there
seems to have come a moment when even our Savior cried out in despair: 'My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8217; In that hour I think I can see our dear
Father behind the veil looking upon these dying struggles until even He could not
endure it any longer; and . . . so He bowed His head and hid in some part of His
universe, His great heart almost breaking for the love that He had for His Son.
Oh, in that moment when He might have saved His Son, I thank Him and praise
Him that He did not fail us, for He had not only the love of His Son in mind, but
He also had love for us. I rejoice that He did not interfere, and that His love for
us made it possible for Him to endure to look upon the sufferings of His Son and
give Him finally to us, our Saviour and our Redeemer </i>(Melvin J. Ballard,
Crusader for Righteousness, pp. 135-37). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Some say that love is the most powerful force in the universe. The love manifested by both the
Father and the Son during the atoning sacrifice is evidence of that truth. Now that we have
considered the perfect love of God, as reflected in His great plan, and in the life and sacrifice of
His Beloved Son, let us turn our attention to Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Charity is a word which represents the love of the Son of God. Mormon defined charity as the<i>
&#8220;pure love of Christ&#8221;</i>. He also referred to charity as <i>&#8220;perfect love&#8221; 
		</i>and <i>&#8220;everlasting love&#8221;
</i>(Moroni 8:17). Alma referred to it as <i>&#8220;redeeming love&#8221;</i> (Alma 5:26).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is this perfect love which actuated the ministry, suffering, death and resurrection of the Holy
Messiah. Because of His love for the Father, Jesus was perfectly obedient to His will and said, 
		<i>&#8220;I
do always those things that please Him&#8221; </i>(John 14:29). It was the Son&#8217;s love for His Father and
for mankind which moved Him in the heavenly council to say <i>&#8220;Here am I, send me&#8221; 
		</i>(Abraham
3:27) and ages later in the agony of Gethsemane to utter <i>&#8220;nevertheless, not my will, but thine be
done&#8221;</i> (Luke 22:42).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Moroni defined this love as charity when he said to the Lord: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I remember that thou hast said that thou hast loved the world, even unto the
laying down of thy life for the world. . .</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the children of men is
charity </i>(Ether 12:33-34). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The gospel of Jesus Christ is the gospel of love and He and His Father are the personification of
love. If we are to become like them, pure love must possess us. The Lord commanded us to
		<i>&#8220;Love one another as I have loved you&#8221; </i>(John 15:12). President Ezra Taft Benson instructed us:
		<i>&#8220;If we would truly seek to be more like our Savior and Master, then learning to love as He loves
should be our highest goal&#8221; </i>(Ensign, November 1986).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President David O. McKay said that we radiate to others what we really are. In the scriptures, we
get a sense of the power of the divine love which radiated from the Savior. In the Book of
Mormon, it was not fear but love which moved the saints to fall <i>&#8220;down at the feet of the
Resurrected Jesus and worship Him&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 11:17). They had been touched by the pure love
of the Divine Redeemer. A similar thing occurred when the Lord appeared to the valiant saints in
the Spirit World while His body was in the tomb. They rejoiced in His presence and in their
redemption and <i>&#8220;Their countenances shone, and the radiance from the presence of the Lord
rested upon them&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 138:24).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President George F. Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve was touched by the Lord&#8217;s love in a
dream: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>The Lord has revealed to me, by dreams, something more than I ever understood
or felt before about the love for God and the love for fellow men . . . I had a
dream, which I am sure was from the Lord. In this dream I was in the presence of
my Savior as he stood in mid-air. He spoke no word to me, but my love for him
was such that I have not words to explain. I know that no mortal man can love the
Lord as I experienced that love for the Savior unless God reveals it unto him. . . .
As a result of that dream I had this feeling, that no matter what might be required
at my hands . . I would do what I should be asked to do, even to the laying down
of my life . . . If only I can be with my Savior and have that same sense of love that
I had in that dream, it will be the goal of my existence, the desire of my life
		</i>(Conference Report, October 1946).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The effect of these supernal personal experiences with the Son of God, and the pure love of
Christ which they felt, was overwhelming to them. Could dwelling in His presence be a partial
realization of Paul&#8217;s statement that <i>&#8220;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him?&#8221; 
		</i>(1 Corinthians
2:9).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Understanding the wonder of this pure love, we may ask how one develops charity. The gospel is
the process and power by which the saints may obtain a Christlike character and 
		<i>&#8220;dwell in the
presence of God and His Christ forever and ever&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 76:62). Mormon
taught the importance of God&#8217;s assistance in becoming like Jesus Christ: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this
love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus
Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall
be like him, for we shall see him as he is</i> (Moroni 7:48).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We learn from that scripture that charity is a gift which God bestows on members of the Church
of Jesus Christ that they may become like Him. The Doctrine and Covenants is very clear about
the necessity and power of priesthood ordinances which aid us in our quest to obtain eternal life
and become perfect <i>&#8220;even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect&#8221; 
		</i>(3 Nephi 12:48).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">That process of perfection is implied in this scripture:</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 84:19-22).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Thus we realize that to develop a divine character we need to receive the bestowed aid of the
Father including the exalting ordinances of the gospel. The Lord said He gave those who
received his gospel <i>&#8220;power to become my sons&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 39:4). 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In addition to the ordinances, we must also live a life of self-mastery and continual repentance
which moves us toward perfection by <i>&#8220;denying yourselves of all ungodliness&#8221; 
		</i>and loving <i>&#8220;God
with all your might, mind and strength&#8221; </i>(Moroni 10:32). By doing these things we are truly
converted and are filled with the pure love of Christ. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">There is a relationship between love and joy. The Spirit taught Nephi that the love of God was
		<i>&#8220;most desirable above all things . . . and the most joyous to the soul&#8221; 
		</i>(1 Nephi 11:22-23). The
Risen Lord taught the same principle as He promised the Three Nephites that <i>&#8220;your joy shall be
full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even
as the Father&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 28:10).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Christlike attributes listed in Preach My Gospel are faith, hope, charity and love, virtue,
knowledge, patience, humility, diligence, and obedience. They are all to become a part of our
nature, of our eternal character. The acquisition of all of them seems to be part of the process of
enduring to the end. Yet, as the prophets have taught, acquiring the attribute of charity or pure or
perfect love is a key to that process. It enables us to develop the other attributes. With that
perspective, Paul wrote that if he spoke with the tongues of angels and had the gift of prophesy
and had faith to move mountains<i> &#8220;and have not charity, I am nothing&#8221;</i> (1 Corinthians 13:2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The attributes of the Savior comprise his divine character with charity being its central feature.
		<i>&#8220;The reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness . . . is that charity,
&#8216;the pure love of Christ&#8217; is not an act but a condition or state of being&#8221; 
		</i>wrote Elder Dallin H.
Oaks. <i>&#8220;Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in conversion. Charity is
something one becomes&#8221; </i>(With Full Purpose of Heart, p. 42).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We have now been reminded that God is love and that Jesus Christ possesses that same pure and
perfect love. His gospel has the atonement as its central feature &#8211; which sacrifice was the single
greatest act of love in the history of mankind. We know that the Father&#8217;s plan and the Son&#8217;s
atonement, which are great evidences of their love for us, are primarily focused on bringing
immortality and eternal life to all men and women. We also know that the perfection of man and
his acquisition of the divine character including attributes of godliness are bestowed, by the
grace of God, through gospel ordinances and righteous living. Let us now consider some of the
evidences of charity to be seen in the lives of the faithful saints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">First, we must have charity to keep the two great commandments and to love God with all our
hearts and souls and minds as the Savior did. President Gordon B. Hinckley provided this
wonderful insight into why loving God first is so important to keeping all other commandments:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Love of God is basic. It is the very foundation of true worship . . . It leads to
obedience to the second great commandment, love of neighbor . . . </i>[Love]<i> is of the
very essence of our faith . . . To love the Lord is not just counsel. It is the first and
great commandment incumbent upon each of us because love of God is the root
from which spring all other types of love; love of God is the root of all virtue, of
all goodness, of all strength of character, of all fidelity to do right </i>(Teachings of
Gordon B. Hinckley, 318-319).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Second, to have charity is to love Jesus Christ so profoundly that we become like Him. Those
who have charity and are converted become <i>&#8220;partakers of the divine nature&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Peter 1:4) so
that <i>&#8220;Christ liveth in </i>[them]<i>&#8221;</i>. This means that <i>&#8220;Christ 
		</i>[is] <i>formed in you&#8221; </i>(Galatians 2-4) and
that one attains <i>&#8220;the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&#8221; 
		</i>(Ephesians 4:13). The Lord
outlined the path to a Christlike character clearly for the Nephites saying, <i>&#8220;Ye know the things ye
must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do&#8221; 
		</i>(3 Nephi
27:21).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Elder Melvin J. Ballard recounted a manifestation in this regard where he was embraced by the
Savior and felt his love grow: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>He put His arms around me and kissed me, as He took me into His bosom, and He
blessed me until my whole being was thrilled . . . with deep joy swelling through
my whole being, I felt that I was in heaven indeed. The feeling that came to my
heart then was: Oh if I could live worthy . . . so that in the end when I have
finished I could go into His presence and receive the feeling that I then had in His
presence, I would give everything that I am and ever hope to be </i>(Melvin J.
Ballard, Crusader for Righteousness, p. 66).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Third, those who have charity love the Lord&#8217;s anointed servants, the First Presidency and the
Twelve, and<i> &#8220;give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to
minister unto you, and to be your servants&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 12:1). They know that 
		<i>&#8220;he that receiveth
my servants receiveth me&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 84:36) Those with charity pray for the
Brethren for they know that they are to be <i>&#8220;upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the
church&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 107:22).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">If we have charity we love the Prophet Joseph Smith 
		<i>&#8220;who has done more, save Jesus only, for
the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 135:3). Charity moves us to love the Prophet Joseph of whom Brigham Young said,
		<i>&#8220;Jesus Christ excepted, no better man ever lived or does live upon this earth&#8221;</i> (Discourses of
Brigham Young, 459).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Fourth, those who have charity love their neighbor. Charity is to realize that the all-seeing Lord
truly considers our acts of neighborly service and love as demonstrations of our personal love for
Him. Elder Bruce R. McConkie told this story: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>My grandmother Emma McConkie was a widow at the time she was president of
the Moab Relief Society. A nonmember who opposed the Church had married a
Mormon girl. They had several children . . . and a new baby. They were very poor
and Mother was going day by day to care for the child and to take them baskets of
food. Mother herself was ill. One day she returned home especially tired and
weary. She slept in her chair. She dreamed she was bathing a baby which she
discovered was the Christ Child. She thought, &#8216;Oh what a great honor to thus
serve the very Christ!&#8217; As she held the baby in her lap she was all but overcome . .
. Unspeakable joy filled her whole being . . . Her joy was so great it awakened her
. . . and these words were spoken to her, &#8220;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&#8221; Now I think the Lord
first tried her faith. When she had proved worthy by manifesting that charity
which never faileth, he gave her a glimpse within the veil</i> (Sermons and Writings
of Bruce R. McConkie, p. 388).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Fifth, if we have have charity we love our husband or wife in perfect fidelity and purity and<i>
&#8220;with all thy heart, and . . . cleave unto her and none else&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 42:22). We
make any sacrifice necessary that we might enter into<i> &#8220;the new and everlasting covenant of
marriage&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 131:2). Those with charity multiply and replenish the earth
through the sacred and godly power of procreation in spite of worldly intolerance and
opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President Boyd K. Packer said of marital love: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Participation in the mating process offers an experience like nothing else in life.
When entered into worthily, it combines the most exquisite and exalted physical,
emotional, and spiritual feelings associated with the word love . . . That part of
life has no equal, no counterpart, in all human experience. It will, when
covenants are made and kept, last eternally </i>(The Things of the Soul, p. 107).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President Spencer W. Kimball gave these two examples of marital love: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>For many years, I saw a strong man carry his tiny, emaciated, arthritic wife to
meetings and wherever she could go. There could be no sexual expression. Here
was selfless indication of affection. I think that is pure love. I saw a kindly woman
wait on her husband for many years as he deteriorated with muscular dystrophy.
She waited on him hand and foot, night and day, when all he could do was blink
his eyes in thanks. I believe that was love </i>(The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,
p. 245).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Sixth, if we have have charity we lead our families in love so that 
		<i>&#8220;the Holy Ghost shall be thy
constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy
dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto
thee forever and ever&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 121:46). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Those who have charity do what the Savior did for the human family when for their sakes He
sanctified himself that <i>&#8220;they also might be sanctified through the truth&#8221; 
		</i>(John 17:19).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Next, if we have have charity we are pure in heart and to 
		<i>&#8220;be purified even as Christ is <span style="font-weight: bold">pure</span>&#8221;</i>
(Moroni 7: 48, emphasis added). For <i>&#8220;the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure
heart&#8221; </i>(1 Timothy 1: 5). Charity is to <i>&#8220;ascend unto the hill of the Lord&#8221; and &#8220;to stand in his
holy place&#8221;</i> (Psalms 24:3) for <i>&#8220;all the pure in heart that shall come into 
		</i>[the temple]<i> shall see
God&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 97:16).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Eighth, those possessed with charity are saviors on Mount Zion for their deceased relatives. The
work of salvation for the dead is one of the greatest evidences of God&#8217;s love for all of His
children. President Gordon B. Hinckley recognized temple work as a labor of love: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Most of the work done in this sacred house is performed vicariously in behalf of
those who have passed beyond the veil of death. I know of no other work to
compare with it. It more nearly approaches the vicarious sacrifice of the Son of
God in behalf of all mankind than any other work of which I am aware </i>(Ensign,
March 1993).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Next, those who have charity obey the Savior&#8217;s command to 
		<i>&#8220;love your enemies&#8221; </i>(Matthew
5:43-45). A wonderful example of this is the missionary work of the sons of Mosiah among the
Lamanites who had <i>&#8220;an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi&#8221; 
		</i>(Mosiah 10:17). The sons
of Mosiah labored, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and
convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure
them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to
rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another
		</i>(Mosiah 28:1-2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In 1946 President George F. Richards of the Twelve recounted a dream in which he and other
brethren were surrounded by armed German soldiers led by Adolph Hitler who seemed to be
preparing to execute them. Then, the circumstances quickly changed and the Germans were
surrounded by the brethren. President Richards approached Hitler and said, <i>&#8220;I am your brother.
You are my brother. In our heavenly home we lived together in love and peace. Why can we not
so live here on the earth?&#8221; </i>He felt a brotherly love for Hitler that the German dictator
reciprocated. They embraced. President Richards said, <i>&#8220;I think the Lord gave me that dream.
Why should I dream of this man, one of the greatest enemies of mankind, and one of the
wickedest, but that the Lord should teach me that I must love my enemies, and I must love the
wicked as well as the good?&#8221; </i>(Conference Report, October 1946).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We should love service as did He who was the greatest among us and the Servant of all. Elder
Dallin H. Oaks explained the connection between service and charity: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Even the most extreme acts of service &#8212; such as giving all of our goods to feed
the poor &#8212; profit us nothing unless our service is motivated by the pure love of
Christ. If our service is to be most efficacious, it must be accomplished for the
love of God and the love of his children </i>(Ensign, November, 1984).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President Marion G. Romney said: 
		<i>&#8220;Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can
earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in
the celestial kingdom is made. . . Service is what godhood is all about&#8221;</i> (<i>Ensign,</i> June 1984, p.3).
When we serve as the Master did, we do so less as a duty and more as a joyous opportunity to
serve and help others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Loving truth as the Lord does means that we will love the principle of repentance, 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>For behold, the Lord your Redeemer . . . suffered the pain of all men, that all men
might repent and come unto him . . . And he hath risen from the dead, that he
might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance. And how great is his
joy in the soul that repenteth! </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 18:11-13).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">How understandable it is that the Lord, who paid an infinite and eternal and incomprehensible
price to rescue the sinner, would have joy when one embraces His sacrifice by repentance. The
parable of the Prodigal Son portrays that truth in such a personal and beautiful way. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Again, if we have have charity we love those things mentioned in the 13<sup>th</sup> Article of Faith: 
		<i>&#8220;We
believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men . . . If
there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things&#8221;
		</i>(Articles of Faith:13).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Latter-day Saints are to be pure as the Lord is pure and love virtue, and righteousness and
truth and goodness as the Lord does. He instructed, that <i>&#8220;Zion must increase in beauty, and in
holiness . . . yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 82:14).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Also, if we have charity we have 
		<i>&#8220;the mind of Christ&#8221;</i> (1 Corinthians 2:16) and <i>&#8220;let this mind be
in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&#8221; </i>(Philippians 2:5). Charity is to 
		<i>&#8220;Sanctify yourselves that
your <span style="font-weight: bold">minds</span> become single to God&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:68, emphasis added). We obtain
the mind of Christ by personal revelation and as it is declared by the living prophets and the
scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Those with charity will be numbered among the people of Zion who 
		<i>&#8220;were of one heart and one
mind, and dwelt in righteousness&#8221; </i>(Moses 7:18). Having charity is to realize the prayer of the
Master that the saints <i>&#8220;may all be one; as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that they also may
be one in us&#8221; </i>(John 17:21).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Again, if we have have charity we are submissive to the will of God. King Benjamin taught his
people to become <i>&#8220;a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child,
submissive, . . . full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon
him, even as a child doth submit to his father&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 3:19). </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">For true followers of the Lamb of God, The Savior&#8217;s words of submissive obedience ring loudly
in our ears, <i>&#8220;Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but
thine, be done&#8221; </i>(Luke 22:42).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">If we have charity we love virtue and are pure in thought and 
		<i>&#8220;Look unto me in every thought&#8221;</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 6:36) and <i>&#8220;Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 121:45). Charity means that we <i>&#8220;Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ&#8221; </i>(2 Corinthians 10:5). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Those who have charity gladly receive correction and chastisement from the Lord and His
servants and repent as Proverbs states: <i>&#8220;My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither
be weary of his correction: For whom the Lord loveth He correcteth; even as a father the son in
whom he delighteth&#8221; </i>(Proverbs 3:11-12). Even at times of divine correction, how reassuring it is
to know that our omniscient Heavenly Father cares enough to chastise and correct us out of his
perfect love for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In conclusion, may our understanding of charity help us prepare for eternal life. Elder Neal A.
Maxwell said: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>The living Church helps us to do and to be that which is needed for admission to
the upper realms of God&#8217;s celestial kingdom. Certain things are essential in order
for us to obtain eternal life. Developing charity is clearly just as essential for
admission to the upper realms of the celestial kingdom as is baptism! We are to
be more than merely nice; rather, we are to be &#8216;full of love&#8217; </i>(If Thou Endure It
Well:32-34).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">May the words of Moroni ring in our ears: 
		<i>&#8220;And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be
saved in the kingdom of God&#8221; </i>(Moroni 10:21). May we follow Mormon&#8217;s counsel to<i> &#8220;pray unto
the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love&#8221; 
		</i>(Moroni 7:48). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President David O. McKay related this dream which he had while in the Pacific Islands: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I then fell asleep, and beheld in vision something infinitely sublime. In the
distance I beheld a beautiful white city . . . I then saw a great concourse of people
approaching the city. Each one wore a white flowing robe, and a white
headdress. Instantly my attention seemed centered upon their Leader, and though
I could see only the profile of his features and his body, I recognized him at once
as my Savior! The tint and radiance of his countenance were glorious to behold!
There was a peace about him which seemed sublime &#8211;  it was divine! The city, I
understood, was his. It was the City Eternal; and the people following him were
to abide there in peace and eternal happiness. But who were they? As if the
Savior read my thoughts, he answered by pointing to a semicircle that then
appeared above them, and on which were written in gold the words: &#8216;These Are
They Who Have Overcome The World - Who Have Truly Been Born Again!&#8217;
</i>(Cherished Experiences from the Writings of President David O. McKay, p. 102)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I pray that we may live to obtain charity and develop a Christlike character that when he appears
we shall be like him and be filled with pure love and a fulness of joy (Moroni 7:48).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I thank the Living God for the flood of truth which is the restored gospel including His never
failing love, patience, and for His Beloved Son who is the head of the Church. In the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. I want you to know that I count it as one of the grand
blessings of my life to be a part of this great institution. I love BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. I embrace its
mission. One can&#8217;t love this place without having a love and respect for its students, faculty,
staff, and administrators. I want to pay particular tribute to president Robert Wilkes, our interim
president. Words cannot express the love, gratitude, and admiration I have for him.</p>
<p>You are to be commended for your desire, and your preparation that have made it possible for
you to be here. You have been chosen for a marvelous work here on earth. You are among the
noble and blessed and in turn will be called upon to serve and strengthen others. It is for this
reason that I have felt to talk with you today about the doctrine of Stewardship. Understanding
this doctrine will help us to better know our place in God&#8217;s eternal plan and what He expects of
us, today, tomorrow, and forever.</p>
<p>In the world, stewardship is to hold something in trust for someone else. Centuries ago,
stewardship was a means to protect a kingdom while the king was away or otherwise unable to
govern because of age or illness (Peter Block, <i>Stewardship</i>, Preface).</p>
<p>In the Church and Kingdom of God, we talk of stewardship in sacred terms. Divine gift,
hallowed trust, and consecrated service come to mind. This is what our second estate is all about. 
		</p>
<p>Elder Wirthlin said your <i>&#8220;most important stewardship is the glorious responsibility your Father
in Heaven has given you to watch over and care for your own soul&#8221;</i> (<i>An Eternal Stewardship</i>, by
Joseph B. Wirthlin, Ensign, May 1997, <i>True To The Faith</i>).</p>
<p>How we see ourselves, and how we care for our own souls are so important, not only to
ourselves but also to those who love us. The quality of our efforts to reach out and serve others
can generally be measured by how we see and feel about ourselves. For this reason it should not
surprise us that the Lord gave us this warning: <i>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">Beware concerning yourselves</span>&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 84:43, emphasis added). </p>
<p>Let me illustrate: Serving as a sealer in the temple, I often see couples standing before the alter
gazing into the mirrors on two opposite walls and looking into what appears to be eternity. When
asked what they see, they will say something like this, &#8220;We see each other, and beyond us we
can see forever.&#8221; They will often try to move from side to side so they can see without
obstruction. They become aware that they themselves are the only obstacles to clearly seeing the
things of eternity, meaning the things of God. Thus the warning <i>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">Beware concerning
yourselves</span>&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 84:43, emphasis added). </p>
<p>To see means to understand. One of the reasons we come to worship at devotionals such at this is
that we might receive His Spirit that we might better see the things of God and understand our
role in His great plan of happiness.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Stewardship</span></p>
<p>Years ago, while conducting a class discussion on stewardship, something remarkable happened.
I posed the question, &#8220;Who captains your stewardship?&#8221; After considerable open, thoughtful, and
sometimes invigorating discussion the class was clearly divided. Some answered &#8220;the Savior&#8221;
while others countered by saying, &#8220;We are the captains&#8221; of our stewardship. The class-time
ended without a clear resolution to the question. </p>
<p>The next morning as I entered my office I noticed on my desk a picture painted by Warner E.
Sallman, entitled <i>Christ the Pilot</i>. On the back of the picture, one of my students wrote a note
that read: &#8220;Brother Price, who captains my stewardship? Hopefully it is as the picture indicates.&#8221; 
		</p>
<p>Though I had seen the picture many times, it was at that moment that insights flowed into my
mind and soul as never before. A thoughtful student&#8217;s initiative and the Spirit of the Lord taught
me that day. For the next few hours I recorded my thoughts, observation, feeling, scriptures and
words of living prophets on the subject of stewardship, while gazing at this picture.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m going to do now is unrehearsed, Just before this devotional I asked Heath Becker if he
would be willing to help me. I showed him a copy of this picture and asked him to study it for a
few moments and take just a minute to share his observations with us. </p>
<p>Let us review Heth&#8217;s observations and add a few from other students. We note that the</p>
<p>1) Conditions are stormy, not unlike life</p>
<p>2.) The speck of blue sky is a ray of hope</p>
<p>3) The Savior is near</p>
<p>4) He is showing (pointing) the way</p>
<p>5) The young man is attentive and alert</p>
<p>6) He appears calm and confident</p>
<p>7) The young man&#8217;s hands are on the wheel</p>
<p>8) The Savior&#8217;s hand is placed gently on the young man&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The young man seems to understand his stewardship role. He seems willing to receive divine
guidance. With our hands on the wheel of stewardship, clearly, we are responsible for what
happens. </p>
<p>As we look at this picture, our role as stewards becomes apparent, and our relationship to the
savior is defined. The Savior has given us every needful gift, endowment, opportunity, and
promise. His gift to us is &#8220;infinite&#8221; in time, scope, love, and mercy. He has given us all, and
withheld nothing (2 Nephi 9:7). </p>
<p>Consider for a moment these questions. What are your stewardships? Have you thought about
them? Have you taken time to identify and list them? Do you understand them? Do you
appreciate them? For the sake of this discussion let&#8217;s consider our various stewardships by
placing them into three categories:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1) Temporary Stewardships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2) Eternal Stewardship Possibilities, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">3) Preparatory Stewardships.</span></p>
<p>A temporary stewardship could be a calling in the Church, your present status as a student here
at BYU-Idaho, and your employment to name just a few. </p>
<p>Your eternal stewardship possibilities would include the covenants you have made. You are a
child of God. You have your family connections&#8212;you are a son or daughter, brother or sister,
husband or wife, cousin, aunt or uncle. For the brethren the priesthood is eternal. Again these are
just a few of your eternal stewardship possibilities.</p>
<p>When we talk of preparatory stewardships we speak of stewardships that are not yet ours, but are
promised to the faithful. </p>
<p>For those of you that are single you have a stewardship responsibility to prepare yourself to be a
husband or wife. If you are married you have a stewardship responsibility to prepare for
parenthood. We are to prepare ourselves to serve the Lord and our fellow man. Opportunities,
callings and, I might add, blessings come to those who have prepared themselves. 
		<i>&#8220;This life is
the time for men to prepare to meet God&#8221; </i>(Alma 34:32). Such preparation often takes the form
of diligent study, faithful living, and meekly serving. Only after such preparation can we turn to
the Lord and say, <i>&#8220;Here am I, send me&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 16:8).</p>
<p>I believe there are five principles that describe, define, and characterize stewardship. These
principles when understood and applied will be a guide to us in fulfilling every stewardship
responsibility we have or will have in this life. These five stewardship principles are:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1) Love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2) Agency</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">3) Availability</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">4) Responsibility, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">5) Accountability.</span></p>
<p>These five principles, when linked together by the enlightening power and gift of the Holy
Ghost, will bring to you and me greater understanding of our possibilities and greater
appreciation of our opportunities. I believe the doctrine of stewardship will, by the power of the
Holy Ghost and the Grace of God, live within us in everything we do, in our schooling, in our
employment, in our service, in our callings, in our friendships, and in our homes. 
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The first principle is love.</span>
</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said of love and stewardship:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Under true stewardship, there is no room for vain ambition, pettiness, or status
seeking. One&#8217;s ambition is to serve the Lord and His kingdom first. Carelessness,
mediocrity, feigned effort, or inconsistent performance have no place where true
stewardship is manifest. <span style="font-weight: bold">Love is the motivating force&#8211;love for God and love for
others</span></i> (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 381, emphasis added).</p>
<p>You will note that the emphasis is on love of God and love for others, not love of power or love
of things, nor is it a selfish self-centeredness. We misuse and compromise our stewardships
when we love self more than others and love things more than God (Alma 11:24). 
		</p>
<p>Setbacks in life will separate the humble and meek servants from the selfish power seekers.
Shakespeare&#8217;s King Richard III noted for his self-centeredness and inhumanity had such a
setback when he found himself dismounted on the battlefield. He cried out 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!&#8221;</i></span><i> </i>At that moment, he would gladly give up all his wealth and power
just to save his life (Peter Block, <i>Stewardship</i>, p 1, emphasis added).</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Lamoni&#8217;s father, the king, faced a similar issue when</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou
wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare me 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">I will
grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom</span> </i>(Alma
20:22-23, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Sometime later, after <i>&#8220;Aaron had expounded&#8221; </i>the gospel to this same king, 
		<i>&#8220;the king asked:
What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? . . . Behold, said he<span style="font-weight: bold">, I
will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great
joy</span>&#8221; </i>(Alma 22:15, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Something extraordinary happens when our love turns to God and away from things of the
world? The worldly King offered &#189; of his kingdom for his life while the converted King offered
all that he possessed for fellowship in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In Elder Russell M. Nelson own voice let&#8217;s listen to what he said about loving and caring: 
		<i>&#8220;As
beneficiaries of the divine creation, what shall we do? We should care for the earth. Be wise
stewards over it. And we are to love and care for one another&#8221; </i>(Elder Nelson, &#8220;The Creation,&#8221;
Ensign, May 2000, 84).</p>
<p>I believe that any capacity we have to love comes to us as a gift from God. The Savior taught and
showed us the way. He said, <i>&#8220;Love one another; as I have loved you&#8221; 
		</i>(John 13:34). He
admonished us to <i>&#8220;Press forward with . . . a love of God and of all men&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Nephi 31:20).</p>
<p>This principle of love is beautifully and simply expressed by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland: 
		<i>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">Only the
Pure Love of Christ will see us through . . . His pure love never fails us. Not now, not ever, not
ever&#8221;</span></i> (Elder Jeffrey R. Holland &#8220;He Loved Us Unto the End, Ensign, November 1989, 25,
emphasis added).</p>
<p>Love unshared or unexpressed is love lost.<span style="font-weight: bold">
<i>&#8220;I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me&#8221;
</i></span>(Hymn 193, emphasis added). </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The second principle is agency.</span>
</p>
<p>Without agency we could have<i> &#8220;no joy&#8221; </i>and we could do 
		<i>&#8220;no good&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 2:23). In other
words: <i>&#8220;If we cannot say no, then saying yes has no meaning&#8221;</i> (Peter Block, 
		<i>Stewardship</i>, p 30).
The phrase &#8220;free agency&#8221; does not appear in scripture. The only agency spoken of there is<i>
&#8220;moral agency&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 101:78). A faithful steward will always apply their
agency in such a way as to be in harmony with the mind and will of the Lord. </p>
<p>Listen carefully to the voice of Elder Richard G. Scott as he teaches the inspired principle of
agency:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Your agency, the right to make choices, is not given so that you can get what you
want. This divine gift is provided so that you will choose what your Father in
Heaven wants for you. That way He can lead you to become all that He intends
you to be. That path leads to glorious joy and happiness </i>(Richard G. Scott,
&#8220;Finding Joy in Life,&#8221; Ensign, May 1996, 24).</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell helps us to understand agency and the process of becoming disciples: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">If we choose the course of steady improvement, which is clearly the course of
discipleship, we will become more righteous and can move from what may be
initially a mere </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">1) acknowledgment of Jesus on to </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">2) admiration of Jesus, and then on to 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">3) adoration of Jesus, and finally to 
		</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">4) emulation of Jesus </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(Elder Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;The Glorious Atonement,&#8221; Missionary Satellite
Broadcast, 29 August 1999, emphasis added). </p>
<p>Sometimes in the process of choosing to improve and become more like the Savior we are
tempted to misuse the gifts and powers we possess. Stewardship not only affects the use of
power, but it also confronts the way we hold privilege. If we use the gifts and power within us to
fulfill our God given stewardship responsibilities, we must let go of personal distinction, glory,
and titles. We must forgo the idea that we should be waited upon.</p>
<p>The Lord counseled:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, there are many called but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to
the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson&#8212; </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of
heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only
upon the principles of righteousness</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 121:34-36). </p>
<p>Please listen to the words of the poem Invictus by William Earnest Henley. Elder Dallin H. Oaks
will give a brief introduction followed by President James E. Faust&#8217;s reading of the Poem:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Invictus by William Earnest Henley</span></p>
<p><i>&#8220;In his famous poem Invictus, William Ernest Henley hurled man&#8217;s challenge against Fate, With
head &#8216;bloody, but unbowed&#8217; determined man is unconquerable&#8221;</i> (Elder Dallin H. Oaks).</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed.&#8221;</i> Here is a response by

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It is a great poem. It places upon the individual the responsibility for what he
does with his life . . . But on the other hand, it may sound arrogant and conceited

many years ago, so regarded it and wrote a marvelous response using the same
poetic meter and entitling his verse &#8216;The Soul&#8217;s Captain.&#8217; I repeat three of the
verses from his writing.</i></p>

<p>Agency when used in righteousness is exalting. Abuse it&#8212; and we lose it to life&#8217;s addictions. 
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The next Principle of Stewardship is availability.</span>
</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell shared this insight on the subject: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">availability</span>,
and if we then prove our <span style="font-weight: bold">dependability</span>, he will increase our 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">capability</span>!</i> (Neal A.
Maxwell, &#8220;It&#8217;s Service, Not Status, That Counts,&#8221; <i>Ensign,</i> July 1975, emphasis
added). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>God gives the picks and shovels to the chosen . . . They may not be the best or
most capable, but they are the most available</i> (Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;Deposition of a
Disciple&#8221; p 54).</p>
<p>This suggests also that our willingness to go where He wants us to go, sometimes implies a
willingness to stay right where we are if that&#8217;s where the Lord wants us (credited to Neal A.
Maxwell). </p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson taught this principle when he shared with us this verse:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Father, where shall I work today? 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And my love flowed warm and free. 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then he pointed out a tiny spot&#8211; and said, &#8216;Tend that for me.'</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I answered quickly, 'Oh no, not that.' 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Why, no one would ever see, 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>No matter how well my work was done.

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Not that little place for me.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the word he spoke, it was not stern;

		<i>Yellow Canaries with Gray on Their Wings</i>,General
Conference, April 7, 1973).</p>
<p>Now ponder the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell as he taught this same principle:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Lord knows our circumstances and the intents of our hearts, and surely the
talents and gifts He has given us. He is able to gage perfectly how we have
performed within what is allotted to us, including by lifting up some of the many
surrounding hands that hang down. Thus yearning for expanded opportunities
while failing to use those at hand, is bad form spiritually</i> (Neal A. Maxwell,
&#8220;Content with the Things Allotted unto Us,&#8221; Ensign, May 2000, 72).</p>
<p>We, like Alma, <i>&#8220;ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto 
		</i>[us]<i>&#8221;
</i>(Alma 29:3). Alma asked, <i>&#8220;Why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have
been called . . . And this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God&#8221;
		</i>(Alma 29:6,9). </p>
<p>Again, it is not all about your ability, but your 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">availability</span>. Prove your 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">dependability</span> and the
Lord has promised you increased <span style="font-weight: bold">capability</span>!</p>
<p>In summary we have learned that as faithful stewards we are motivated by a 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">love of God</span> and are
free to <span style="font-weight: bold">choose</span> to make ourselves 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">available</span> to serve. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The next principle is responsibility.</span></p>
<p>We alone are responsible for what we choose to love and to what cause we make ourselves
available. President James E. Faust said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Each of us must take the responsibility for the moral decisions we make in life
about how close we live to the edge. Lehi states: &#8220;And because that they are
redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to
act for themselves and not to be acted upon&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:26). Being acted upon
means somebody else is pulling the strings </i>(James E. Faust, <i>Acting for Ourselves
and Not Being Acted Upon</i>, <i>Ensign,</i> Nov. 1995, 45).</p>
<p>Look at the painting once more. Is &#8220;somebody else pulling the strings?&#8221; President Hugh B.
Brown explained the principle of responsibility this way: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Freedom to choose involves responsibility for choice just as privileges and rights
involve duties and obligations . . . If man is to be the master of his fate and if he
strives for a high destiny, he must assume moral responsibility, engage in moral
struggle, and exercise moral faith</i> (Hugh B. Brown, The Eternal Quest, p.64,65).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The last principle of stewardship is accountability.</span></p>
<p>I love the way President Hinckley teaches. Rather than preaching and telling us what we should
be doing he humbly talks in first person and shares with us the things that he strives for, hopes
for, and the things he tries so hard to do. Listen to his voice as he shepherds us to an
understanding of accountability:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We are answerable to Him in this life, and will be held accountable when we are
called before Him to make our report. I hope that we shall not be found wanting. I
hope that when that time comes, I may have the opportunity of standing before my
Beloved Savior to give an accounting of my stewardship, and that I may be able
to do so without embarrassment, or apology, or excuse. I have so tried to conduct
my life</i> (Gordon B. Hinckley, &#8220;In . . . Counselors There Is Safety,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign, </i>Nov.
1990, 48).</p>
<p>Remember, <i>&#8220;It is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his
stewardship, both in time and in eternity&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 72:3).</p>
<p>Our accountability can validate our agency and confirm our responsibility. 
		<i>&#8220;Free will is
thine&#8211;free agency, To wield for right or wrong; But thou must answer unto Him To whom all
souls belong&#8221; </i>(Elder Orson F. Whitney, &#8220;Soul&#8217;s Captain&#8221;).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I share with you the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell,<i> &#8220;I thank Jesus . . . for his
marvelous management of time, for never misusing a moment, . . . Even his seconds showed his
stewardship. . . &#8221; </i>(Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth, Savior and King,&#8221; Ensign, May 1976,
26).</p>
<p>As we seek to understand and fulfill our stewardships, I pray that we will be</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.1in; margin-left: 0.2in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">&#183;Motivated by Love.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.1in; margin-left: 0.2in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">&#183;Free to Choose.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.1in; margin-left: 0.2in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">&#183;Available to Serve.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.1in; margin-left: 0.2in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">&#183;Responsible to Act, and</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.1in; margin-left: 0.2in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">&#183;Accountable to God.</span></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, as I said in my opening, you have been chosen for a marvelous work here
on earth. You are among the noble and blessed. You have been called upon to <i>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">build up</span> the
kingdom of God&#8221; </i>(JST Matthew 6:38). Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: <i>&#8220;By divine appointment,
these are </i>[our] <i>days </i>(Helaman 7:9) . . . <i>Moreover, though we live in a failing world, we have not
been sent here to fail&#8221; </i>(Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;Encircled in the Arms of His Love,&#8221; p 17,18).</p>
<p>Indeed, our individual stewardships come to us by &#8220;divine appointment&#8221; and &#8220;we have not been
sent here to fail.&#8221; Our success and happiness will come in living these principles of stewardship.
Our strength to do so will come through the enabling powers of the Atonement of our Lord and
Savior. This testimony I share with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, it is an honor to be here today. In a published sermon entitled, &#8220;What Think
Ye of Christ,&#8221; my father-in-law, B. West Belnap, told the following story:
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Once I was in a far city, far from home, on Mother&#8217;s Day, and I was alone. I went
into a church . . . in town, as there was no Latter-day Saint Church nearby. The
minister gave a very fine sermon, and in the course of his address he said, &#8216;Adam
fell that men might be, and men are that they might have joy&#8217; (2 Nephi 2:25). My
ears pricked up at this. Afterward I went up to him and said, &#8216;I&#8217;m interested in
that statement &#8216;Adam fell that men might be.&#8217; He looked at me and said, &#8216;Are you
a Mormon?&#8217; I said. &#8216;Yes, I am.&#8217; He said, &#8216;come with me.&#8217; He took me back to his
office and pulled down a Book of Mormon and said, &#8216;there is a lot of good stuff in
here; I just don&#8217;t tell them where it comes from&#8217; </i>(What Think Ye of Christ,
Extension Publications, Division of Continuing Education, BYU, 17).</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk about some of that &#8220;good stuff&#8221; in the Book of Mormon. I hope to
offer encouragement to follow President Boyd K. Packer&#8217;s counsel when he said, 
		<i>&#8220;life moves all
too fast. When you feel weak, discouraged, depressed or afraid, open the Book of Mormon and
read. Do not let too much time pass before reading a verse, a thought, or a chapter&#8221; 
		</i>(<i>Ensign</i>,
May 2005, p. 8). </p>
<p>The Book of Mormon was prepared for three audiences: The Jews, the Lamanites, and the
Gentiles. According to Book of Mormon usage of these terms, everyone on earth can be placed
under one of these three designations. In his last writings, recorded in 2 Nephi chapters 25-30,
Nephi systematically addresses each group, foretelling the problem of apostasy. He also reveals
a two-fold common solution: (1) the Savior Jesus Christ, and (2) a book that would come forth in
the last days to teach and testify of him&#8212;the Book of Mormon. </p>
<p>Speaking first to the Jews, Nephi reveals the problem:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh
that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth,
shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because
of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their
necks. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, they will crucify him . . . 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations</i> (2 Nephi 25:12-13, 15). 
		</p>
<p>Nephi then teaches the solution to this problem:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from
their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and
a wonder among the children of men. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words 
		</i>[the Book of Mormon] <i>unto them </i>[the
Jews]<i>, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them
for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them
		</i>(2 Nephi 25:17-18, emphasis added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as the Lord
God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses
power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous
serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up
before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water
should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and
as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be
this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved</i> (2 Nephi
25:20).</p>
<p>This is target-audience persuasion at its best. Nephi is appealing to a Jewish audience, an
audience that commonly looks to Moses and the Exodus story for affirmation of the Lord&#8217;s love
and care for the house of Israel. In Nephi&#8217;s rhetoric he uses the ancient Hebraic oath, 
		<i>&#8220;as the
Lord God liveth,&#8221; </i>to swear on the truth of three sacred exodus events that salvation only comes
through Jesus Christ. The events themselves are symbols or types of the Savior. The use of the
oath and the Exodus accounts reveals Nephi&#8217;s culture&#8212;this is a Jew speaking to Jews. Although
Nephi was a genealogical descendent of Joseph of old, he came out from the Jews, he was from
Jerusalem, and his family were citizens of the Kingdom of Judah. </p>
<p>In short, the problem Nephi foretells is that because of iniquity Judah would reject Jesus Christ,
the true Messiah; the solution Nephi teaches would be the Book of Mormon, a record written to
convince Jews that Jesus is the Christ. </p>
<p>We do not preach the gospel extensively to the Jews. We are not flooding Jewish population
centers with the Book of Mormon. Nephi&#8217;s words give us a glimpse into the use of the Book of
Mormon among the Jews at some future day. Considering the role of the Book of Mormon in the
millennial gathering of Jews, perhaps the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell apply when he stated
that<i> &#8220;the best days of the Book of Mormon are still up ahead&#8221; </i>(Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;By the Gift
and Power of God,&#8221; Ensign, Jan. 1997, 36). </p>
<p>Nephi then shifts his attention to his own people, again foretelling the problem of apostasy: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and
they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away,
and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my
people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I
know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the
reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction</i> (2 Nephi
26:9-10).</p>
<p>Nephi again specifies that his writings about Jesus Christ would be a central element of the
solution to the problem: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things
which I <span style="font-weight: bold">write </span>shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from
generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his
seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand</i> (2 Nephi 25:21;
emphasis added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For we labor diligently to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">write</span>, to persuade our children, and also our brethren,
to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God</i> (2 Nephi 25:23; emphasis
added).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of
Christ, and <span style="font-weight: bold">we write</span> according to our prophecies, that our children may know to
what source they may look for a remission of their sins </i>(2 Nephi 25:26; emphasis
added).</p>
<p>Nephi clearly teaches that his reason for writing about Christ is to save his descendants, a branch
of the seed of Joseph. Lehi, in a blessing to his youngest son Joseph, prophesied of the success of
the Book of Mormon in saving his latter-day lineage: <i>&#8220;Wherefore, because of this covenant thou
art blessed; for thy seed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the words of the
book&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 3:23). </p>
<p>Finally, Nephi addresses the Gentiles. In 2 Nephi chapters 26&#8211;29 he prophesies concerning the
apostate conditions <i>&#8220;in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Nephi 27:1), namely:
pride, envy, strife, malice, priestcraft, multiple churches, secret combinations, false teachers,
false doctrines, being drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations, and drawing near
unto the Lord with words, but having hearts that are far away.</p>
<p>Nephi&#8217;s solution for the Gentiles is the same: <i>&#8220;And as I spake concerning the convincing of the
Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that
Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 26:12).</p>
<p>He then quotes the prophecies of Isaiah to foretell the restoration of the gospel and the coming
forth of the Book of Mormon, the Lord&#8217;s convincing instrument to bring Gentiles to Christ:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a
marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall
perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid</i> (2 Nephi 27:26).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the
blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness </i>(2 Nephi 27:29).</p>
<p>Can the Book of Mormon really do all that Nephi said? The Book of Mormon surely must have
big shoulders to bear the weight of being a cental factor in the solution to the great apostasy. Of
course a book cannot save souls; salvation comes only to Jews, Lamanites, or Gentiles 
		<i>&#8220;through
the Atonement of Christ . . . by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel&#8221; 
		</i>(Article of
Faith 3). Salvation comes individually to those who are born again, and who endure to the end.</p>
<p>So how can the Book of Mormon have such a dramatic influence? As a part of his last testament,
Nephi gives some indications as to how the Book of Mormon would accomplish its mission:
		<i>&#8220;And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it
persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of
Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal&#8221; 
		</i>(2
Nephi 33:4). </p>
<p>The writing, translation, publication, and distribution of the Book of Mormon is in fact God the
Father&#8217;s effort to persuade his children to come unto his Son Jesus Christ, repent of their sins,
and be saved. I would like to discuss two of Nephi&#8217;s points about how the Book of Mormon
carries out its appointed errand. First, the Book of Mormon speaks of Jesus and persuades
readers to believe in him, and second, the Book of Mormon persuades readers to do good. 
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Number One: The Book of Mormon speaks of Jesus and persuades readers to believe in
him. </span>Jesus is the central character in the Book of Mormon&#8212;he is everywhere; and we should
look for him on every page. His name-titles, which are instructive in and of themselves, total
over one-hundred: He is the &#8220;Rock,&#8221; the &#8220;Creator,&#8221; the &#8220;Savior,&#8221; the &#8220;Redeemer,&#8221; the
&#8220;Messiah,&#8221; the &#8220;Eternal Judge,&#8221; the &#8220;Sure Foundation,&#8221; the &#8220;Good Shepherd,&#8221; the &#8220;Founder of
Peace,&#8221; the &#8220;King of Heaven&#8221; and the &#8220;light and the life of the world.&#8221; The principal authors and
abridgers of the Book of Mormon&#8212;Nephi, Jacob, Mormon, and Moroni&#8212;saw Jesus and knew
personally of whom they wrote. The stories in the Book of Mormon that they included are
interesting, but they are secondary to the witness of Christ that comes from them. And it is the
witness of Christ that persuades, soften hearts, and changes lives.</p>
<p>Try looking for Jesus Christ and central truths concerning him as I retell two familiar stories. In
Lehi&#8217;s dream Lehi sees a man dressed in a white robe who invites him to follow him. As Lehi
follows he observes that he is in a dark and dreary waste. In this darkness he prays for mercy,
after which he is shown a tree with beautiful white fruit. Upon tasting this fruit Lehi feels great
joy and desires to share the fruit with his family. Pause for a moment and one can see echoes of
Jesus&#8217; central message to all people. Could the man in the white robe typify Jesus Christ, who
beckons all to<i> &#8220;come follow me?&#8221;</i> Inasmuch as the fall of Adam and Eve brought sin, death, and
mortal probation&#8212;a dark and dreary waste&#8212;our prayer must be for mercy, for all sin, and all are
subject to the exacting demands of divine justice. To obtain this mercy we must partake of the
fruit of the tree of life, or the love of God. The greatest manifestation of this love is the
Atonement of Jesus Christ, <i>&#8220;for God so loved the world that he gave his Only Begotten Son&#8221;</i>
(John 3:16).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider another story in Alma chapter 14. This is the story of Alma and Amulek in prison
in Ammonihah. As I read verses 18 through 20 try to find the witness of Christ. 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many lawyers,
and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and
they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many
words; but they answered them nothing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not
answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up
unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on
the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And many
came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this
people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver
yourselves?</i> (Alma 14:18-20).</p>
<p>The silence before the wicked judge, the threat of the judge using his authority to deliver the
prisoners to death, the smiting on the cheeks, and the invitation for the prisoners to use their own
power to save themselves, are all echoes of scenes of Christ before his Jewish and Roman
persecutors and words spoken when he was on the cross. </p>
<p>After much suffering, Alma cries to the Lord concerning their bondage: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength
according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke
the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began
to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them</i> (Alma 14:26). </p>
<p>In this story we have both an implicit and explicit witness of Christ&#8212;implicit in Alma and
Amulek being types of Christ in prison, and explicit in the teaching that deliverance from
bondage comes through faith in Jesus Christ. Christ is the solution to whatever bondage we
might find ourselves in during our mortal lives; the cords that hold us captive are loosened on a
timetable of the Lord&#8217;s choosing, sometimes only after a period of what we might describe as
imprisonment or bondage.</p>
<p>Jesus said <i>&#8220;seek and ye shall find.&#8221; </i>As we seek for Jesus in the pages of the Book of Mormon
we find a repeated emphasis upon his mission and message throughout. Illustrative of such
searching are the observations of Professor Richard D. Rust who wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Nephi was like Christ in being resisted as the rightful spiritual ruler, in being a
factor in the stilling of a turbulent sea, in fulfilling his father&#8217;s mission, and in
guiding his people to a promised land. King Benjamin typified Christ in that he
was a mortal representation of a heavenly king. Abinadi, too, exemplified Christ,
as an innocent person who is cast into prison for three days, whose blood is shed
for his testimony, and who at his death says, &#8216;O God, receive my soul&#8217; (Mosiah
17:19). The three-day deathlike trances and spiritual rebirths of Alma and king
Lamoni were types of Christ&#8217;s death, burial, and resurrection </i>(Book of Mormon
Reference Companion, &#8220;Book of Mormon, as literature,&#8221; Deseret Book, 2003,
123). </p>
<p>Mormon masterfully weaves testimony and truths about Jesus Christ into his narrative. Consider,
for example, what is learned about Jesus from the preaching of Alma and Amulek to the apostate
Zoramites in Alma chapters 32 to 34. The central theme of the Zoramite account is the answer to
what Amulek calls <i>&#8220;the great question, . . . whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether
there shall be no Christ&#8221; </i>(Alma 34:5). In Alma 32, Alma teaches a formula detailing how one
can know that Jesus is the Christ. In chapter 33 he quotes the prophets Zenos (Alma 33:3-13) and
Zenock and refers to an event in the ministry of Moses to further support his testimony
concerning Christ (Alma 33:15-16, 19-21). In chapter 34, Amulek testifies of redemption from
the fall through Christ (Alma 34:8-9); the infinite nature of Jesus&#8217; Atonement (Alma 34:10-12);
the meaning of the law of Moses, <i>&#8220;every whit pointing to </i>[Jesus&#8217;] 
		<i>great and last sacrifice&#8221;
</i>(Alma 34:14, emphasis added); and how mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, in order that
the repentant can be encircled in the arms of Jesus&#8217; safety (Alma 34:15-16).</p>
<p>The Christ-centered doctrinal content of these few chapters exemplifies the teaching of Elder
Neal A. Maxwell who wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The doctrinal density of the Book of Mormon clearly overshadows the portion
that is given over to history . . . The book&#8217;s structure is clearly and intentionally
secondary to its substance, and its plot to its principles. The Book of Mormon&#8217;s
innumerable insights and doctrinal declarations constitute their own witness.
Clearly, this book came through but not from Joseph Smith. It is translated
language, but its substance is of the Savior </i>(<i>Plain and Precious Things</i>, Salt Lake
City: Deseret Book, 1983, 14).</p>
<p>For skeptics of the biblical witness of Christ&#8217;s divinity, his virgin birth, his miracles, his death
for sin, and his resurrection on the third day, the Book of Mormon provides another written
testament. Chapters such as 1 Nephi 11 and Mosiah 3 bear testimony of key aspects of the
Savior&#8217;s life that are critical to an individual&#8217;s testimony that he is literally the Son of God and
the Savior of the world. These aspects are found in the Bible, but they are questioned, doubted,
and outright denied by some Christian scholars, teachers, and even some clergy. After surveying
this scepticism concerning Christ in a <i>Time</i> magazine article, religion editor, David Van Biema,
concluded: <i>&#8220;Every new book, every new theory seems to wear away some long-cherished relic in
this battle between faith and knowledge. Those who would come to Jesus&#8217; rescue must ask, Is it
too late? Can that which has been rejected be restored?&#8221; </i>(Biema, David Van, &#8220;The Gospel
Truth?&#8221; <i>Time,</i> April 8, 1996, 54).</p>
<p>As a professor of ancient scripture I am grateful for the Qumran scrolls, but they are nothing
compared to Cumorah&#8217;s plates&#8212;Another Testament of Jesus Christ&#8212;which was brought forth to
restore faith in cherished biblical truths concerning the reality and divinity of Jesus Christ. Truly
the Book of Mormon speaks of Jesus and persuades readers, even skeptics, that Jesus is the
Christ. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Number Two: The Book of Mormon persuades readers to do good.</span> One way the Book of
Mormon persuades readers to do good is by repetitively illustrating the blessings of choosing
good as opposed to the negative consequences of choosing evil. The Book of Mormon repeatedly
teaches the truth that humankind is free to choose the path that leads either to eternal life and
happiness or to eternal death and misery. Samuel the Lamanite told wicked Nephites to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>remember . . . that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself . . . for behold, ye
are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto
you a knowledge and he hath made you free. . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good
and be restored unto that which is good . . . or ye can do evil, and have that which
is evil restored unto you </i>(Helaman 14:30-31). </p>
<p>As we read the Book of Mormon, we can learn throughout its pages about Christ and the path to
happiness, or Satan and the path to misery. The Book of Mormon contains stories of individuals
and groups who make choices that put them on one path or the other, and then it shows the
consequences that follow inevitably from these choices. Behaviors, attitudes, practices, and
people representative of the two paths are contrasted so readers can clearly see what leads away
from Christ as opposed to what leads to him. For example, while Lehi&#8217;s dream teaches about the
path to the tree of life, which is a symbol of <i>&#8220;the love of God&#8221;</i> (1 Ne. 11:21-22, 25), it also
teaches and warns about the<i> &#8220;great and spacious building,&#8221; </i>a symbol for 
		<i>&#8220;the pride of the
world&#8221; </i>(1 Ne. 8:26-28; 11:35-36). </p>
<p>Many such contrasts fill the pages of the Book of Mormon: humility versus pride (Alma 4);
sacred covenants versus secret combinations (Mosiah 18; Ether 8); priesthood versus priestcraft
(Alma 1); the messianic teachings of the prophets Jacob and Alma versus the teachings of the
antichrists Sherem and Korihor (Jacob 7; Alma 30); the character and actions of the Nephite
chief captain Moroni versus the character and actions of the dissenter Amalickiah (Alma 48); the
deceit of the Gadianton chief robber Giddianhi versus the integrity of chief judge and prophet
Lachoneus (3 Nephi 3); the characteristics and principles governing Zion versus the evil beliefs
and practices that can destroy Zion (4 Nephi).</p>
<p>The Lord&#8217;s promise throughout the record is that if the Nephites kept the commandments, they
would prosper in the land, and if they did not, he would cut them off (2 Nephi 1:20). The Book
of Mormon contains a record of the literal fulfillment of the Lord&#8217;s promise: its people were
blessed, prospered, and preserved as they obeyed, or eventually scattered, smitten, and destroyed
as they disobeyed. The righteousness and wickedness of the Nephites make up two histories,
dual narrative threads, that illustrate the reality and consistency of the consequences of making
right and wrong choices.</p>
<p>Righteousness afforded the Nephites safety from their enemies, deliverance from their captors,
refuge from destruction, and a knowledge of the mysteries of God through the power of the Holy
Ghost. Conversely, disobedience brought difficulty, sorrow, suffering, bondage, and eventual
destruction (Mosiah 27:16; Alma 9:22; 36:29). With the negative consequences of sin and the
positive consequences of obedience convincingly illustrated, the Book of Mormon does much to
persuade readers to choose good which leads to eternal life and happiness rather than evil which
leads to eternal death and misery.</p>
<p>At BYU-Hawaii I was standing outside a religion class in the hallway and a student came out of
his Book of Mormon class and said: &#8220;I hate that class.&#8221; I asked him &#8220;why, is it the teacher?&#8221; He
said no, and then explained: &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand to read the Book of Mormon and to continue to live
my life the way I am living it.&#8221; Sometimes reading the Book of Mormon is like a two-edged
sword&#8212;you are either soothed and settled by the sweetness of the Lord&#8217;s spirit, or cut in the
heart, for, as Nephi taught, <i>&#8220;the guilty </i>[take] <i>the truth to be hard&#8221; 
		</i>(1 Nephi 16:2, emphasis
added). </p>
<p>Another way the Book of Mormon persuades us to do good is by providing personal counsel.
Readers receive one-on-one instruction from the Savior, or from him through the voice of his
servants. Try personalizing the following instruction by inserting your own name just before the
counsel. For purposes of illustration I will impose a reader&#8217;s name before each example:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Ashley: <i>Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand 
		</i>(Jacob
4:10).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Maryann: <i>To be learned is good if

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Rachel: <i>Remember . . . the awfulness of yielding to the enticings of that cunning
one. Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is
life eternal </i>(2 Nephi 9:39).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Kelly: <i>I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of
his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth
agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor
to commit sin also </i>(Mosiah 4:28).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Daniel: <i>If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the
song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now? </i>(Alma 5:26).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Matthew: <i>Are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not
prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of
heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life </i>(Alma 5:28).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Alan: <i>Will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted,

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Kristene: <i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into
the world </i>(3 Nephi 11:10).</p>
<p>Just as the personalized instructions Lehi received on the Liahona changed from time to time
according to the people&#8217;s faith and diligence, reading the Book of Mormon can be a source of
continuing revelation. No matter how many times we read the Book of Mormon, personal
application of passages can change because we change; we can receive continuing revelation as
we continue to read. The Book of Mormon is thus forever relevant and always applicable. 
		</p>
<p>Words alone do not make the difference unless confirmed by the Holy Ghost, whose mission it is
to bear witness of Jesus Christ. Nephi said that <i>&#8220;the words which I have written in weakness will
be made strong unto them&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 33:4). It is the Holy Ghost that makes the words in the
Book of Mormon strong. The Book of Mormon is saturated with the Spirit of God, persuading
readers to believe in Christ, remember him, and to do good. It is strong medicine to make the
spiritually weak well, and it is preventative medicine to protect and retain the faithful. Reading
the Book of Mormon can be like attending a great testimony meeting that is centered in Christ, a
meeting that inspired greater commitment, increased love for the gospel, and more resistance to
worldly influences.</p>
<p>When Jesus came to the Americas he descended from the heavens before the eyes of all the
assembled people. Yet his ministry among them may be described as one-on-one. He invited
those present to come forth individually so that they might see, feel, and know him personally.
Coming unto Christ for Jews, Lamanites, and Gentiles is similar. One persuaded reader at a time
repositions himself or herself from sand to rock, from error to truth, from the kingdom of the
world to the kingdom of God. One persuaded reader at a time puts off the natural man and
becomes <i>&#8220;a saint through the atonement of Christ&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>I would like to share two examples of the one-on-one persuading power of the Book of Mormon.
The first comes from a letter a student of mine received from her sister: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It came as an incredible shock to me one day to find my testimony gone. I was
studying in Paris at the age of nineteen. Culture shock, removal of familiar faces,
places, and habits all took their toll. Discussions with &#8216;intellectual&#8217; associates left
me grappling for words to support my religious beliefs. The Church seemed
narrow and naive in the wake of the wide, wide world I was discovering.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It was after many long weeks that I sat down one afternoon in my little Paris
room and opened the Book of Mormon. Alma 32 says that the beginning of faith is
desire. Did I desire to believe? I turned to 3 Nephi and began to read the account
of the resurrected Christ visiting the Nephites. Suddenly I was struck with a
realization. No man could have written this from his own mind! A rush of hope
and light came pouring back into my hungry spirit. The Book of Mormon could
not be explained away. It had a divine origin.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I mark that point as a profound beginning in my life. The testimony I have now
has its roots in the warmth and hope of that moment. Twelve years have passed,
during which time I have married in the temple, had five beautiful children, and
served in many Church callings. I wonder where life would have taken me had I
not reopened that wonderful book. I have heard it said that the Book of Mormon
is the most correct book ever written. To me it was a lifesaver. </i></p>
<p>The second example comes from a Book of Mormon student of mine who wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Nephi&#8217;s words testify of the divinity of Christ in clear and concise terms. I have
witnessed in my own life and those who I taught on my mission how Nephi&#8217;s
words have softened our hearts and filled our minds with light. Before my mission
I began to read the Book of Mormon for the first time. I was undecided whether to
serve a mission or not. Almost imperceptibly I felt anxious and a great desire to
serve a mission. Where once only doubt and confusion which led to sin filled my
life, a new sense of peace and wanting to fulfill the commandments entered into
my mind and heart. I still had questions but I also had a peace that urged me
forward to preach the gospel.</i></p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Every Latter-day Saint should make the study of [the Book of Mormon] a lifetime
pursuit. Otherwise he is placing his soul in jeopardy and neglecting that which
could give spiritual and intellectual unity to his whole life. There is a difference
between a convert who is built on the rock of Christ through the Book of Mormon
and stays hold of that iron rod, and one who is not . . . It will hold us as close to
the Spirit of the Lord as anything I know </i>(<i>Ensign</i>, May 1975, 65).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul wrote:<i> &#8220;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
high </i>[places]<i>&#8221; </i>(Ephesians 6:12, emphasis added). In such a wrestling match as this, against such
an organized foe as Lucifer, we might well ask ourselves: Do I have within me the Book of
Mormon difference that President Benson spoke of, so that when Satan sends <i>&#8220;forth his mighty
winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat
upon </i>[me],<i> it shall have no power over </i>[me] <i>to drag </i>[me] <i>down to the gulf of misery and endless
wo, because of the rock upon which </i>[I am] <i>built </i>[?]<i>&#8221;</i> (Helaman 5:12). 
		</p>
<p>Eighteen months after becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I
went on a mission to Ireland at the age of twenty-two. In the Salt Lake City mission home, just
three days prior to my departure, it became apparent to me that I lacked a very important
missionary aid. I knew through prayer that the Church was true, so I knew that the Book of
Mormon must be true. But the Book of Mormon had not been a part of my conversion and I
hadn&#8217;t read it. I started reading that day and finished my first reading about a month later. I knelt
down by my bed in Dublin, Ireland, and reported to the Lord that I had read the Book of
Mormon and desired a spiritual witness of its truth. After a period of pondering in my prayer I
received a revelation through the power of the Holy Ghost that was strong, clear, and definite.
Brothers and sisters, I know that the Book of Mormon is true. And I know that it has nourished
my spirit, and it has strengthened my conviction, as I have continued to read and to study over
the years. </p>
<p>The Book of Mormon does have a lot of good stuff between its covers. The Book of Mormon is a
central component of the marvelous work and wonder of the Restoration. The Book of Mormon
is a key instrument to bring the Jews, Lamanites, and Gentiles out of apostasy. The Book of
Mormon is the keystone of our religion that introduces us to the chief cornerstone of our
religion, Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon persuades us to do good; and it speaks of Jesus, and
persuades us <i>&#8220;to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Nephi 33:4).</p>
<p>I pray that each of us will continue to read the Book of Mormon and pray and ponder about its
contents. I testify that by so doing we will retain spiritual strength through its witness of Christ,
and its persuasion to do good. Again, President Packer said:<i> &#8220;Life moves all too fast. When you
feel weak, discouraged, depressed or afraid, open the Book of Mormon and read. Do not let too
much time pass before reading a verse, a thought, or a chapter&#8221;</i>(Ensign, May 2005, p. 8). In the
name of Jesus Christ, amen</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters I appreciate the opportunity to share my feelings and testimony with you.
Because your time is precious I feel the responsibility to share something
meaningful&#8212;something the Lord would have you know. I pray for and invite the Spirit and ask
that you also pray for the Spirit to be with us. If we receive the gift of the Spirit during this
devotional, we will all be taught in spite of my shortcomings.</p>
<p>Who am I? Each of us must carefully consider this question if we are to find true happiness and
successfully navigate our way through this life and into the next one. When we understand who
we really are and come to know our Heavenly Father, we will discover how much He loves us.
Our Father loves all His children. However because of prior preparation, blessings, and special
gifts, He requires more from some of those children. Because we are here, enjoying the blessings
of the gospel, the holy priesthood, and an education at BYU-Idaho, we can be sure our Father
requires more from us. Once we understand who we are we will not be so quick to question our
Father&#8217;s commandments or the directions we receive from our priesthood leaders. I think the
time will come when we will all wish we had tried harder to do the things we knew to be right.
Thus it is essential that we come to grips with who we are as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I am a child of God, and he has sent me here,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Has given me an earthly home with parents kind and dear.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I am a child of God. Rich blessings are in store,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If I but learn to do his will I&#8217;ll live with him once more.</i></p>
<p>I am a child of God. I&#8217;m grateful for the gifts and blessings He has given me. I believe these gifts
include not only spiritual gifts and material blessings, but also family, friends, leaders,
associates, opportunities, and daily experiences. Heavenly Father has always been aware of my
needs and desires; He has been very kind to me. Yet like many of you, in my weaknesses, I often
struggle to do what is right. It reminds me of a favorite statement from Elder J. Golden Kimball,<i>
&#8220;I am trying to be wise; I am trying to be prudent, and I confess I am having a terrible time. I am
a man of weakness; I am a man full of faults; but God knows I have given Him the best effort
there was in me.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It is important that we give the Lord the best effort that is in us. Throughout my life there have
been too many times I wish I had given more. I hope that I can live, that each of us can live,
without regrets. </p>
<p>As I share some thoughts with you, I do so humbly. I hesitate to use personal experiences,
because it may seem that this is about me and it is not. My hope is that some of these experiences
will confirm that God is mindful of all his children. God does not love us for the things we
accumulate or the worldly accolades we receive; He loves us for who we are and what we do.</p>
<p>Several years ago my daughter Jenny lost a very special ring in the grass of our backyard. We
searched diligently, but it seemed hopeless. We had been playing a ball game and didn&#8217;t know
exactly where she lost it. It was important to her, so we prayed for help to find this ring. We
continued to search and just before giving up, I kneeled down and ran my fingers through the
grass. I could not believe it; the ring slipped over one of my fingers. It seemed impossible, but
there it was. How can we deny a Father who rules the universe, yet still cares about the small,
important things of our lives? It&#8217;s true that not every prayer is answered immediately and
sometimes the answers aren&#8217;t what we hope for, but isn&#8217;t it nice to know that the object of our
faith and trust is a God who loves us and who knows our needs and concerns.</p>
<p>I know that sometime in your lives your Heavenly Father in some large or small private way has
made His love and concern known to you. Through these experiences we all know in a very
personal way that He lives, loves us deeply, blesses us regularly, and wants us to succeed. He
wants us to grow to be like Him and to return with our families to His presence&#8212;to our heavenly
home. Our Father blesses each of us according to His wisdom and according to our needs. He is
fully involved with us and our success and happiness. <i>&#8220;For behold this is my work and my glory
to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&#8221; </i>(Moses 1:39). The allegory of the tame
and wild olive trees in Jacob 5 teaches powerfully of the love and effort the Lord showers on his
vineyard. He nourishes, digs, prunes, dungs, and works tirelessly to protect and preserve the
trees and the fruit of His vineyard. What a great example of His love, effort, and sacrifice to
bring to pass our immortality and eternal life. Doesn&#8217;t this help with the question &#8220;Who am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elder Dennis E. Simmons taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Mortality is not an accident of nature. It is a brief segment of the great plan of
our loving Father in Heaven to make it possible for us, His sons and daughters, to
achieve the same blessings He enjoys, if we are willing. In our premortal life, we
were instructed by Him as to the purpose of mortality: &#8216;We will make an earth
whereon these may dwell; and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do
all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.&#8217; So there we have
it&#8212;it's a test. The world is a testing place for mortal men and women. When we
understand that it's all a test, administered by our Heavenly Father, who wants us
to trust in Him and to allow Him to help us, we can then see everything more
clearly </i>(Elder Dennis E. Simmons, May 2004, Ensign).</p>
<p>This life is temporary; it is a time to see if we will use our blessings and talents as He directs&#8212;as
He uses them. To help us our Father has given us many special gifts. One such gift is a physical
body. Our bodies give us great powers and provide great opportunities if we use them in
appropriate ways, but these bodies also bring into play our carnal natures. If we do not use our
bodies in appropriately, their powers can destroy us and can be very harmful to others. In Mosiah
we read:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will
be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and
putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ
the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love,
willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as
a child doth submit to his father</i> (Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>Along with our bodies, our Father has given us the gift of agency, the power to act for ourselves
and not be acted upon. We are able and free to become like our Father or to become like our
brother Lucifer. To become like our Father we must overcome our natural being. Often our
natural man uses the gift of agency as a justification for doing what we want. Have you ever used
the phrase, &#8220;Well I have my agency&#8221;? Elder David A. Bednar often taught that agency is the gift
to act and that agency is more about acting than about choosing. With agency we 
		<i>&#8220;are free
forever, knowing good from evil; to act for </i>[ourselves] <i>and not be acted upon . . .&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Nephi
2:26) Yet with agency we are accountable; we are responsible to act in the way the Lord would
have us act and to use our time and blessings appropriately. <i>&#8220;Verily I say, men should be
anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass
much righteousness, for the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 58:27-28).</p>
<p>We learn a great lesson by comparing Nephi with Laman and Lemuel. Nephi humbly submitted
his will to the Lord and kept every commandment he received. It seems that Laman and Lemuel
murmured about every commandment of the Lord. Why did they murmur? Because <i>&#8220;they did not
believe that I </i>[Nephi] <i>was instructed of the Lord&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 17:18). When and why do we
struggle with agency and murmur? When do we fall away? When do we complain or feel
offended at a word or a commandment or a policy?</p>
<p>We murmur when we, like Laman and Lemuel, give in to pride. Pride is selfishness and part of
the natural man; it is a great roadblock to our progress. Pride causes contention; we look
sideways at others, judging and comparing rather that looking upwards to God. We live for
ourselves and not for God. We think my will be done and not thy will. We murmur when we
doubt the Lord&#8217;s existence or involvement in our lives; when we don&#8217;t believe our leaders are
instructed of the Lord; when we mock sacred things; and when we follow our own agenda.
Sometimes we just doubt. Laman and Lemuel said: <i>&#8220;We knew that ye could not construct a ship.
We knew ye were lacking in judgment. Wherefore thou can not accomplish so great a work&#8221;</i>(1
Nephi 17:19). President Monson has taught that Satan tries to fill us with doubt and fear. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t do it; you&#8217;re too young, too old, too inexperienced, etc. You can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; I was impressed
when Elder Bednar&#8217;s son Michael said:<i> &#8220;Faith has driven fear out of my father&#8217;s life&#8221; 
		</i>(March
2005, Ensign p 16).</p>
<p>How can we put off this natural man? By yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and turning
to Christ. The promptings of the Holy Ghost and the great enabling power of the Atonement help
us control our physical natures and passions. God&#8217;s grace can give us the power to submit our
wills to God&#8217;s will and to be obedient. The Holy Spirit will lead us to become saints if, as the
Savior commanded, we become like a child: meek, humble, and willing to submit to our Father.
Then our Father, who knows us best, and who knows what is best for us, can mold us into what
He knows we can and must become. Elder Russell M. Nelson taught, <i>&#8220;We must think as God
would think, say what He would say, act as He would act, do what He would do, and love as He
would love.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In short, brothers and sisters, we must exercise our agency appropriately and become like Him.
To ensure our success our Father has filled our lives with many special events and tender
associations. </p>
<p>Elder Neal Maxwell taught the following in his last General Conference address, 
		<i>&#8220;There are
clusters of memories embedded in each of your lives. And these can help us to &#8216;remember how
merciful the Lord hath been&#8217; (Moroni 10:3). He certainly has been to me&#8221; 
		</i>(Elder Neal A.
Maxwell, May 2004, Ensign).</p>
<p>Elder Bednar taught a similar concept last General Conference as he explained the many 
		<i>&#8220;tender
mercies&#8221; </i>that come from the Lord to each one of us. He quoted from Nephi, 
		<i>&#8220;But behold, I,
Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath
chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance&#8221;</i> (1
Nephi 1:20).</p>
<p>Elder Bednar went on:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are real and that they do not occur
randomly or merely by coincidence. Often, the Lord's timing of His tender
mercies helps us to both discern and acknowledge them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Through personal study, observation, pondering, and prayer, I believe I have
come to better understand that the Lord's tender mercies are the very personal
and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and
because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ </i>(Elder David A. Bednar, May 2005
Ensign).</p>
<p>Elder Bednar also taught that those who qualify for the Lord&#8217;s tender mercies are those who are
chosen by the Lord, and they are chosen because of their obedience, their aspirations and their
hearts. Does it not seem reasonable that a small girl loved by her Heavenly Father might be
chosen and receive the tender mercy of finding a very special ring as a consequence of her
humble, faithful prayer.</p>
<p>In addition to these tender mercies, and in His wisdom, God has blessed us with weaknesses.<i>
&#8220;And if men come unto my I will show unto them their weaknesses. I give unto men weakness . .
.&#8221;</i> (Ether 12:27). Why would he do that? That we may be humble and turn to Him for help. 
		<i>&#8220;For
if they humble themselves before me and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become
strong unto them&#8221; </i>(Ether 12:27).</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters it is very important that we are humble and wise enough to turn to the Lord
and acknowledge His hand in the &#8220;tender mercies&#8221; of our lives. It is also necessary that we
acknowledge His hand in our successes and accomplishments that we may receive and develop
the gifts of humility and meekness which gifts are essential for us to ultimately receive the
greatest of all gifts&#8212;eternal life. As we learned from Satan&#8217;s experience in the pre-existence,
this work is not about us and our glory. For it is not by our power that these things are done. The
glory and honor must be given to the Father.</p>
<p>In Jacob 4:6-7 we read:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit
of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith
becometh unshaken, <span style="font-weight: bold">insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus
and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</span></i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Nevertheless, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it
is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we
have power to do these things.</span> </i></p>
<p>John Ruskin wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I believe the test of every great man is 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">humility</span>. I do not believe that humility
means doubting one&#8217;s own personal power, but really, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">truly great men have a
curious feeling that greatness is not in them, but through them</span>, and they see the
divine in every other man and are endlessly, foolishly, incredibly merciful.</i></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters I am a weak and simple man and have not always accomplished all I should
have done. If the Lord continues to help me and to love me in my weaknesses, then he will help
you. We are all among the weak and the simple, but He loves us. During my mission, President,
then Elder, Hinckley made a visit to Korea. When he spoke to the missionaries, he looked at us,
paused for a moment and said, <i>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t much, but you are all he has.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>God knows our weaknesses and needs. He knows what is best for us and He provides us with
experiences and associations from which we can learn great truths. About 18 months into my
mission I was called to be a district leader. This particular district had four Korean sisters. I was
not the most talented Korean speaker in our mission and the sisters posed a challenge. Not only
did I struggle to communicate with and interview the sisters, but they also brought a number of
investigators in for baptismal interviews. The other senior elder in this district was a great
missionary who had received a powerful gift of tongues. Elder David Middleton not only spoke
and understood Korean; he wowed the Koreans with his skills and pronunciation. In most
settings Koreans immediately turned to Elder Middleton because of his language skills. For a
weak and simple, older district leader this was a humbling turn of events. One Sunday afternoon,
as I struggled with this situation, I received an impression that continues to have application for
me. In our lives, the Lord blesses (gifts) us with people who possess greater abilities in some
areas than we have, that we might be humble. I believe He does this so we will look to and trust
others to help us with our assignments and responsibilities. We can&#8217;t do it all ourselves. This
great work is not about us; it is the Lord&#8217;s work and His glory. We are merely assisting Him. In
order to bless others and to follow and become like our Savior we must acknowledge this and get
out of the way.</p>
<p>As a young father and first time homeowner, I discovered there were many little chores to be
done, and I wasn&#8217;t very good at some of them. One fall I had to get on the roof and winterize the
swamp cooler. I was feeling sorry for myself when my little daughter excitedly asked if she
could get on the roof with me. Kids love to get on the roof. Dads hate having kids on the roof
because they run around, get too near the edge, create distractions, and well, just because. When
you&#8217;re the Dad you get to be on the roof and kids don&#8217;t. Jenny ignored my objections and
pressed me to let her on the roof. She promised that she would sit still. Well with my special
&#8220;Daddy&#8221; authority I told her she could get on the roof, but it wouldn&#8217;t be pleasant. She was to sit
in one spot, out of the way, and remain very, very still. She was so excited that she agreed. Once
on the roof I did my Dad job and Jenny sat in the kid&#8217;s spot. She was pretty good, but whenever
she even thought of leaving her assigned spot I commanded her to &#8220;Sit Down.&#8221; Eventually she
grew bored with this arrangement and wanted down. I exercised my fatherly prerogative and
said, &#8220;You wanted to be up here and here you will stay until I&#8217;m finished.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure her &#8220;on the
roof experience&#8221; was not as pleasant as she had hoped. Finally I finished the work and started to
cover the cooler with a tarp. By this time the wind had begun to blow and I couldn&#8217;t hold down
all the corners and tie the loose ends. I struggled for a time and finally a little voice said, &#8220;Dad I
can help.&#8221; Well among other imperfections I can be ornery and stubborn. She is just a little girl;
she can&#8217;t help. I don&#8217;t have time to mess around. However, I grew increasing frustrated and
eventually gave up; I finally allowed this cute little girl to help and we soon finished the task.</p>
<p>How embarrassed I felt. Once again the Lord in a tender mercy taught me how much we can
achieve when we acknowledge our weaknesses and allow others to help and teach us. In my
career I have also grown each time I admit that I don&#8217;t know everything and when I allow others
to help in the work by sharing their talents. It is important that we understand it is not about us
and that we give others the opportunity to contribute, to grow, and to succeed. God humbles and
teaches us.</p>
<p>In the Words of Mormon: &#8220;<i>And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things
which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will&#8221; 
		</i>(Words of Mormon
1:7).</p>
<p>And in His wisdom, He gives us friends to help us and strengthen us. I have always loved the
following verse from the Joseph Smith&#8212;History: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>While preparing to start&#8212;being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon us
that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise&#8212;in the midst of
our afflictions <span style="font-weight: bold">we found a friend</span> in a gentleman by the name of Martin Harris,
who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey</i> (Joseph
Smith&#8212;History 1:61, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Well the swamp cooler scene has played out many times in my life and slowly I&#8217;m learning the
lesson. My infinitely patient wife, my children, and fellow employees have added so much to my
life. When I allow others to help and teach me I am far more successful and much happier. And
so again to Mosiah 3:19: If we in faith humble ourselves, acknowledge our weaknesses and
submit to the Lord&#8217;s wisdom, He can work wonders with us. He can make so much more of us
than we can make of ourselves. It is also a tremendous blessing to invite others into our lives.
For when we open our hearts to others we discover the importance and the power of
love&#8212;another of our Father&#8217;s great gifts.</p>
<p>The power of love is demonstrated in Christ&#8217;s pure love and charity. This pure love for all is at
the heart of God&#8217;s power. It gave the Father the strength to give His only begotten Son and it
allowed that Son to endure and to accomplish the Atonement. </p>
<p>Elder John H. Groberg taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When filled with God&#8217;s love, we can do and see and understand things that we
could not otherwise do or see or understand. Filled with His love, we can endure
pain, quell fear, forgive freely, avoid contention, renew strength, and bless and
help others in ways surprising even to us.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Jesus Christ was filled with unfathomable love as He endured incomprehensible
pain, cruelty, and injustice for us. Through His love for us, He rose above other
insurmountable barriers. He invites us to follow Him and partake of His
unlimited love so we too may rise above the pain and cruelty and injustice of this
world and help and forgive and bless </i>(November 2004 Ensign p. 11).</p>
<p>In Moroni 7:47-48 we are taught: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found
possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of
heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who
are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God;
that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that
we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.</i></p>
<p>How can we receive this great gift of charity and be purified as our Savior is pure? It is bestowed
upon us when we follow a chain of gospel principles that leads us forward precept upon precept.
If we are to be purified, as Christ is pure, we must exercise our agency and act for ourselves in
righteousness. To act in this way we need faith which is the first principle of the gospel and
another gift from God. As we develop faith, we also receive the gift of hope. <i>&#8220;And what is it that
ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ
and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in
him according to the promise&#8221; </i>(Moroni 7:41).</p>
<p>Faith and hope provide security and direction. President Hinckley lives by these principles:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It all works out. Don&#8217;t worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work
out. If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your trust in God and move
forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us . . . If
we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His
blessings, He will hear our prayers</i> (President Gordon B. Hinckley).</p>
<p>This is the Lord&#8217;s work and we can do all things in the strength of the Lord. But this requires
commitment and great effort on our part. We must accept our Father&#8217;s gifts. We must exercise
our agency and put off the natural man. We must trust the Lord and meekly submit to His will.
This requires sacrifice. Elder Bruce Hafen taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But growth means growing pains. It also means learning from our mistakes in a
continual process made possible by the Savior&#8217;s grace, which He extends both
during and &#8216;after all we can do.&#8217;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But grace is not cheap. It is very expensive, even very dear. How much does this
grace cost? Is it enough simply to believe in Christ? The man who found the pearl
of great price gave &#8216;all that he had&#8217; for it. If we desire &#8216;all that [the] Father
hath,&#8217; God asks all that we have. To qualify for such exquisite treasure, in
whatever way is ours, we must give the way Christ gave&#8212;every drop He had:
&#8216;How exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.&#8217; All of His
heart, all of our hearts.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If we must give all that we have, then our giving only almost everything is not
enough. If we almost keep the commandments, we almost receive the blessings.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We can have eternal life if we want it, but only if there is nothing else we want
more.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>So we must willingly give everything, because God Himself can&#8217;t make us grow
against our will and without our full participation. Yet even when we utterly
spend ourselves, we lack the power to create the perfection only God can
complete. Our all by itself is still only almost enough&#8212;until it is finished by the
all of Him who is the &#8216;finisher of our faith.&#8217; At that point, our imperfect but
consecrated almost is enough</i> (Elder Bruce Hafen November 2004 Ensign pp. 97-99).</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father wants to give us all that he has. He knows what that will take. He knows
we are weak that we must learn and grow. He knows that for us to receive this great gift we must
put off the natural man and surrender our wills to Him.</p>
<p>In a recent devotional Elder Goaslind also taught us on this subject:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>President Joseph F. Smith saw in vision &#8216;the hosts of the dead . . . who had
offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God&#8217;
(Doctrine and Covenants 138:11-13). How can our sacrifices be in the similitude
of the Savior&#8217;s great infinite and eternal sacrifice? Very simply, we can submit
our wills to the Father&#8217;s. Rather than persisting in our &#8216;carnal wills and desires&#8217;
(Mosiah 16:11), our wills, like the &#8216;will of the Son,&#8217; should be &#8216;swallowed up in
the will of the Father&#8217; (Mosiah 15:7). This is how Christ lived, and this is how
Joseph Smith lived. Such submission to God led ultimately to death. Joseph&#8217;s
martyrdom was indeed in similitude of the Lord&#8217;s great sacrifice, for he went
where he was sent and did what he did knowing full well where it would lead.</i></p>
<p>&#160;In his final General Conference address Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: 
		<i>&#8220;Brethren you submit
your wills to God, you are giving Him the only thing you can actually give Him that is really
yours to give. Don&#8217;t wait too long to find the altar or to begin to place the gift of your wills upon
it!&#8221; </i>(Ensign, May 2004, p 46).</p>
<p>We are children of our Heavenly Father. Can we see His love for us in the events, lessons,
people and &#8220;tender mercies&#8221; of our lives? Can we turn to Him in meekness and faith? We have
to let go of everything; even what seems good to us, if we are to gain the greatest of all gifts.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At this risk of revealing how shallow I can be, I give you an example from my life. I learn many
things from my wife and children. They keep me humble. My son Sam loves games. He loved
golf and became quite good at an early age. He had some success in junior golf tournaments and
in fact qualified for the Junior World Championships in Torres Pines California. One day Sam
thoughtfully asked, &#8220;Dad how can you play golf for 30 years and never be any good.&#8221; It is a fair
question that I&#8217;m still trying to answer.</p>
<p>Well along with Sam I realize that I may never be any good. But as I have struggled to improve I
have begun to understand that I need to think differently. I may have to give up a satisfying part
of my game if I want to get better. Like many others, I love to hit the ball far. I enjoy beautiful,
long shots. But I&#8217;m beginning to see that if I want to improve my scores I have to give up some
of those beautiful, long shots in favor of control and consistency; I must exercise judgment.
Control and consistency is not as awesome as power, but it makes for lower scores and that is
good.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better example: This past spring my wife, Julie, and I had the opportunity to visit
Nauvoo and the temple. For those of you who have not yet had that opportunity let me say it is
beautiful. As I sat in the Celestial Room I thought of the Prophet Joseph and the Saints. They
came to Nauvoo to build Zion. They came to build their homes and a temple to their God. How
hard it must have been to leave all they had worked for. But as I thought on these things I began
to realize that it was important for them to leave and move to the Rocky Mountains. They went
west, and though it was not what they wanted to do and though it seems they had failed, in the
Salt Lake Valley they established themselves; they built homes, churches, and temples. They
built up the Church and kingdom of God. They gave up their homes and temple in Nauvoo, but
in Salt Lake, protected from the world, the kingdom thrived. Its resources grew. Faith,
membership, financial and spiritual resources all grew to point where the Church could return to
Nauvoo and rebuild the city and the temple. Today the temple and the Church&#8217;s presence exist in
strength. And one day, I believe there will be temples in Independence, at Adam-ondi-Ahman
and there will be a dedicated House of the Lord in Kirkland. Though they were forced to let go
of so much in Nauvoo, the Lord opened the door for his kingdom to return and it will never be
removed. We too must let go of what we think is best and trust the Lord. He will see that the
work is done.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Testimony</span></p>
<p>I am grateful for my many blessings. I&#8217;m grateful for my parents who have sacrificed their
interests for me and who have taught me many important lessons. I&#8217;m grateful for my wife, for
her patience and sacrifices. She encourages me and makes me a better person. I try hard but often
end up doing the measurable things while she is constantly doing the kind charitable things. I am
grateful for the Brethren and I love them and their teachings. I believe that I gained that love for
the Brethren from my Grandfather who loved them. He often told me: &#8220;There ain&#8217;t 
		one of those guys that donât know what he is talking about.â I bear 
		witness that is true. I know that President Hinckley is Godâs anointed 
		prophet. I know our Heavenly Father lives and loves us. I know that His 
		greatest desire is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life. I 
		know that we are all weak and we struggle to be what we should be. But 
		our Father is patient with us if we will sincerely try. We canât 
		continue to ignore the little things or resist in obeying the 
		commandments or in following the counsel of the Brethren. The little things define our character. Our Father is
trying to guide us back to His presence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</p>
<p style="text-align: center">August 19, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Interim President Robert M. Wilkes</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a unique and wonderful day! In many ways it is microcosmic of life and lives. It is a day
of change, even exciting change. As we say hello to our new president; our new first lady; new
faculty, staff, and administrators; and new students, we say goodbye to those who are graduating,
transferring, or otherwise moving on. They, for the most part, are not sad goodbyes, but rather
victorious, triumphant, potentially rewarding goodbyes&#8212;ones full of possibility, adventure,
excitement, and change. It is all happening as anticipated it would be&#8212;and, in fact, as it should
be. </p>
<p>The process of change before us is difficult to define. Brigham Young University-Idaho, for
example, is expectant with hope and confidence as President and Sister Clark assume their place
at the head of the university. New and returning students arrive&#8212;confident that ambitious, self-imposed and newly committed-to expectations will be realized. The irony of definition comes
with the fact that the university will move forward&#8212;very much the place it has always been for
well over 100 years and, at the same time, we are clearly aware that it will never be the same
again.</p>
<p>As with the school, so it is with each one of us. We will always be who we have always been;
and yet, in ways that are significant, we ought to never again be the same as we figuratively and
literally walk out these doors and assume rightful places as contributing citizens of the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps the key is to welcome and embrace change as an agent of growth, with all of its
unknowns, fears, and challenges. If rightly viewed, whatever changes come, the reality of
confronting their attendant challenges will only reinforce the essential identity of who we are and
what we are capable of contributing.</p>
<p>Lines penned by Kimber Ricks, a long-time associate and friend of this institution, are
instructive:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Oh, that I could go, yet stay,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Have tomorrow; keep today.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Cherish, hold my yesterday . . . 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . my yesterday, now treasured dear,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>was once tomorrow, seen with fear</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(<i>Changes</i>, Kimber Orson Ricks).</p>
<p>Following his service in the Eisenhower cabinet as Secretary of Agriculture, President Ezra Taft
Benson once observed: <i>&#8220;Every right carries with it a responsibility. Every opportunity is a
challenge&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Red Carpet</span>, Ezra Taft Benson, p. 214). President Benson went on to share four
recommendations for successfully dealing with opportunity and challenge:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;&#160;</span><i>We must know the challenge we face.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in"><i><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;&#160;</span>We must maintain faith . . . .</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in"><i><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;&#160;</span>We must shore up our weaknesses and increase our strength.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in"><i><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;&#160;</span>We must be worthy through righteous living and desires for continued divine blessings</i>
(Ibid., p. 126).</p>
<p>These understandings serve us well as individuals and as an institution. In any case, to see
change or challenge as unfortunate impediments to reaching a goal is clearly shortsighted and
misguided. Together, change and challenge become catalysts&#8212;moving us forward on the
&#8220;charted course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is our core values, our ideals, that shape each soul&#8217;s response to change and
challenge. The ideals that guide us largely determine whether our capacity and our humanity and
our faith are strengthened or weakened by the inevitable vicissitudes attendant to life and living.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball quoted from an address given by Carl Schurz at Faneuil Hall in
Boston: <i>&#8220;Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But like
the seafaring man in the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them
you will reach your destiny&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Educating Zion</span>, Welch/Norton, p. 67).</p>
<p>May your ideals, values, and faith in God the Eternal Father and his Only Begotten Son Jesus
Christ guide you along a true course. May your destiny be one of goodness and joy, as well as
the attendant peace that comes to the faithful from Him who knows best the truths associated
with such things. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Lay the Right Foundation</span></i>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</p>
<p style="text-align: center">August 19, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Elder Jay E. Jensen</p>
<p>Elder Kerr, President Wilkes, President Clark, honored guests, administration, faculty, graduates,
family, and friends, we honor and recognize you this morning. I am humbled and grateful for the
privilege of speaking today.</p>
<p>President J. Reuben Clark Jr. taught that, <i>&#8220;We get nearer to the Lord through music than
perhaps through any other thing except prayer&#8221;</i> (J. Reuben Clark, in Conference Report, Oct.
1936, p. 111). Thank you, Adam, Melissa, Douglas, and Sharee for helping to establish a
spiritual foundation for these exercises. Also, I thank those who have prayed, spoken, and
contributed today.</p>
<p>I express appreciation to President Wilkes for his many years of devoted service, and extend
congratulations and best wishes to him and Sister Wilkes as the new President and Matron of the
Billings Montana Temple. We welcome President Kim Clark and his wife, Sue. When I first met
President Clark seven years ago in connection with the Boston Temple, I knew that I was going
to be working with a man of unusual gifts and talents. I value highly his sound judgment, wise
counsel, and spiritual sensitivity, which helped resolve the challenges that we faced.</p>
<p>Each president of this university has succeeded in lifting it, in building on the solid foundation
established by his predecessors.</p>
<p>A translator of the King James Bible recognizing the work of earlier translators and how he and
his associates were blessed by those who had gone before them: <i>&#8220;We are like dwarves sitting on
the shoulders of giants. We see more, and things that are more distant, than they did, not
because our sight is superior or because we are taller than they, but because they raise us up,
and by their great stature add to ours&#8221; </i>(Standing on the Shoulders of Giants, written by John of
Salisbury, <i>In The Beginning</i>, Alister McGrath, p. 176).</p>
<p>Great giants have presided over this university. President Clark, we are confident you have been
raised up for this very day and with Heaven&#8217;s help will see clearly. Similarly, all of us are better
today and are raised higher because of those who have gone before. The hand of the Lord is upon
us and upon this work.</p>
<p>I like the word &#8220;mindful.&#8221; Ammon taught that God &#8220;<i>is mindful of this people, . . . a branch of the
tree of Israel. . . . God is mindful of every people; . . . yea, he numbereth his people, and his
bowels of mercy are over all the earth&#8221; </i>(Alma 26:36-37). I testify that whether you recognize it
or not, each graduate seated here today has experienced miracles&#8212;health, finances, protection,
spiritual healing through the Atonement, and much more&#8212;as evidence of Heavenly Father being
		<i>&#8220;mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land&#8221; </i>(Alma 26:36).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lay the Right Foundation</span></p>
<p>My message to you graduates today can be summarized in four words: &#8220;Lay the right
foundation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In February 1853, Brigham Young led others in a groundbreaking ceremony for the Salt Lake
Temple. The workmen dug the trenches and laid the foundation for the temple using layers of
large sandstone blocks, a five-year effort. In 1858, with the coming of Johnston&#8217;s Army, the
trenches were filled with dirt and covered over to protect the work. After the Army left, the
foundation was uncovered. Brigham Young made an inspection and found that the large
sandstone foundation blocks had cracked and were unstable. Such a foundation could never
support a temple that would have to endure through the Millennium. He instructed the workers to
take out the faulty foundation and lay a new one.</p>
<p>Fourteen years after the groundbreaking, the foundation of the temple was complete and the
heavy granite blocks of the upper walls could be put in place. Knowingly, President Brigham
Young confirmed, <i>&#8220;The foundation has to be right&#8221;</i> (see Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, 
		<i>Every Stone
a Sermon</i>, P. 20-21).</p>
<p>My young friends, your foundation has to be right. You will be successful to the degree that you
have established a solid foundation of doctrine, principles, and eternal truths.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Foundation of the Church</span></p>
<p>I witness to you that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and all its institutions and
programs are like the Salt Lake Temple, on the right foundation. Essential foundation stones that
have been part of every gospel dispensation from Adam to Joseph Smith include revelation,
scriptures, priesthood and priesthood keys, and ordinances and covenants.</p>
<p>With these foundation stones in place, <i>&#8220;the only true and living church upon the face of the
whole earth&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 1:30) was organized, and being <i>&#8220;built upon the
foundation of apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone&#8221;
		</i>(Ephesians 2:20).</p>
<p>I testify that prophets and revelation are the lifeblood of this work. One month following the
death of President Harold B. Lee, then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley said: <i>&#8220;We either have a
prophet or we have nothing; and having a prophet, we have everything&#8221; </i>(Gordon B. Hinckley,
		<i>Ensign</i>, January 1974, p. 122).</p>
<p>I would like to paraphrase his statement as follows: &#8220;We either have revelation or we have
nothing; and having revelation, we have everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, speaking at the Washington D. C. Joseph Smith Symposium,
said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Joseph Smith&#8217;s teachings about the significance of revelation in our day are
clearly the principal difference between Mormons and our brothers and sisters in
other religious traditions. This is not a technicality. For us it is big. It is the
foundation of our Church doctrine and governance, and it is also fundamental to
personal conversion, personal decision-making, and how we understand and
apply the inspired texts we call scriptures </i>(Dallin H. Oaks, &#8220;Joseph Smith in a
Personal World,&#8221; Conference on &#8220;The Worlds of Joseph Smith,&#8221; May 6, 2005, p.
1).</p>
<p>We have the hope, even the confidence, as you graduate today that you believe this, and because
you believe you will seek revelation, search the scriptures, honor the priesthood and those who
hold the keys, and receive the ordinances and keep the covenants. As you firmly position these
foundation stones in your lives individually and in your families, you will feel comfortable with
these four suggestions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1. Increase in personal righteousness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2. Pay a full tithe and a generous offering.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">3. Seek the blessings of an eternal family.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">4. Be a person of integrity.</p>
<p>As we consider these suggestions in greater detail, ponder how each one is now a part of your
foundation or needs strengthening.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Increase in Personal Righteousness</span></p>
<p>Lonie, my wife, and I love and respect you graduates. We believe that you sincerely strive to
grow closer to the Lord and become like Him. My parents helped me understand how to do this.</p>
<p>I grew up in the small farming community of Mapleton, Utah, the sixth of ten children. My
father died 39 years ago; my 93-year-old mother lives yet in Provo. My father was the
consummate priesthood holder at home and church, although he never served in a visible
leadership calling. His greatest success was as a righteous priesthood holder at home. He
presided over the family and was assisted by my mother&#8212;his companion, partner, and
counselor. As companions they counseled together on all matters pertaining to our home and
family. They gave us a precious heritage of home-centered religious habits. These private
practices at home are not measured nor reported, unlike the institutional practices that appear in
the Church&#8217;s quarterly activity and attendance reports.</p>
<p>The private religious practices that we saw at home and that became the foundation of my life,
include personal kneeling prayer, night and morning; kneeling family prayer night and morning;
daily personal study of the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon; reading regularly the
words of the prophets and other Church leaders in the <i>Ensign</i> and other Church publications; and
fasting as counseled the first Sunday of the month and at other times as needed.</p>
<p>While prayer in our home was practiced and taught, truly it was more &#8220;caught&#8221; than it was ever
formally &#8220;taught.&#8221; Many times as a boy I walked into my parents&#8217; bedroom and found either my
father or mother kneeling at the side of their bed saying a personal prayer. They did not have to
tell me, although I am sure they did, that we should kneel in prayer night and morning: I simply
saw them do it.</p>
<p>Family scripture reading was &#8220;hit and miss&#8221; as a boy growing up in the 1940s and 50s. But I do
have a vivid memory of my parents&#8217; love, reverence, and respect for the Book of Mormon and
the counsel of the prophets to strengthen and bless their family. They believed in the promises
they heard from President Joseph F. Smith that for families who hold a family night, as it was
called before family home evening, the children would not go astray. Our family nights began
and ended with prayer. For a lesson my father often read stories from <i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">A Voice from the Dust</span></i>, a
simplified version of the Book of Mormon, followed by games, activities, and refreshments.</p>
<p>With the foundation of personal righteousness seen in my parents, it was easy to develop the
same patterns in my own life, especially during my mission. President Hinckley&#8217;s comment
about the impact of his mission on him was the same for me. <i>&#8220;Something happened inside of me
in England that was so significant and deep-rooted that I have never gotten over it. It is the same
thing I have seen happen to thousands of other young men and women who commit themselves to
the Lord and their faith in Him becomes their anchor. Everything good that has happened to me,
is a result of what happened while I lived in that land&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</span>, p.
64).</p>
<p>Thus, during my mission in Texas and New Mexico I made commitments to never let a day go
by without kneeling in personal prayer and reading and studying the scriptures. I continue to
keep those commitments that I made over 40 years ago.</p>
<p>To those who have served full-time missions, we thank you. We trust that your mission and your
home life had a similar impact on you. Serving others and developing these habits bring great
joy. We urge all young men, and the sisters who choose to serve, who have not yet served, to
prepare for, to be worthy of, and to qualify for a mission call.</p>
<p>These daily habits and practices are part of my foundation of personal righteousness. They are
what the Apostle Paul described about those Saints who are rooted, grounded, settled, and
established (Ephesians 3:17; Colossians 1:23, 2:7).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pay a full tithe and a generous offering</span></p>
<p>You, your parents, friends, family, and the Church have all contributed a significant amount of
money to bring you to these commencement exercises today. We have every expectation that
you will show your love for the Lord and those who have helped you by paying a full tithe and a
generous fast offering. President Gordon B. Hinckley recently reminded us: <i>&#8220;The payment of
tithes is the real test of a testimony of its members&#8221; </i>(General Authority Training, 31 Mar 2005).</p>
<p>The most important financial decision you will make in mortality is to pay a full tithe and a
generous offering. Paying tithing opens the windows of heaven to both spiritual and temporal
blessings. Temporal blessings do come through Malachi&#8217;s promised open windows. Perhaps you
have experienced such blessings as unexpected money has arrived; or you received an appliance,
an automobile, or a television, all of which ran beyond their life expectancy; or maybe a job offer
came just in the nick of time. All of this happens regularly. Most, if not all, can testify it is so,
but sometimes we emphasize the temporal blessings to the neglect of the spiritual. Among the
most noted blessings passing through the windows of heaven are spiritual guidance for the wise
use of the nine tenths of the income you keep, personal revelation, spiritual power, sound
judgment, spiritual healing, and peace. I am convinced that some of the most valuable blessings
that came through those windows to my wife and me were the spiritual guidance to strengthen
our marriage and raise our six children.</p>
<p>Lonie and I dated in high school; she waited for me while I served a two and one-half year
mission. We married 33 days after I was released from my mission. I returned to BYU. Lonie
was working at a bank, and the plan was to have her work to support us while I studied full time
to finish the three and one-half years needed to obtain my bachelor&#8217;s degree and a teaching
certificate. Within three months we were expecting our first son, and with the pregnancy she was
too sick to work. I found a job and worked part-time, (sometimes I worked two jobs), studied
full-time, and added another child, a daughter, and graduated three and one-half years later, just
as we had planned. Then I began teaching seminary in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
<p>The income from my part-time jobs, my full-time summer work, and my wife&#8217;s stay-at-home
child care for a working mother met our basic needs and part of the tuition. We obtained student
loans to finance the tuition for the closing semesters of my undergraduate education. Here now is
a word of counsel: If you have student loans, retire the debt as quickly as possible and practical.</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson gave wise counsel to us about debt in the April 2005 General
Conference:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Avoid the philosophy and excuse that yesterday&#8217;s luxuries have become today&#8217;s
necessities. They aren&#8217;t necessities unless we ourselves make them such. Many of
our young couples today want to begin with multiple cars and the type of home
Mother and Dad worked a lifetime to obtain. Consequently, they enter into long-term debt on the basis of two salaries. Perhaps too late they find that changes do
come, women have children, sickness stalks some families, jobs are lost, natural
disasters and other situations occur, and no longer can the mortgage payment,
based on the income from two salaries, be made </i>(Thomas S. Monson, &#8220;Constant
Truths for Changing Times,&#8221; <i>Ensign</i>, May 2005, p. 20).</p>
<p>I testify that for the Jensen family the promises in Malachi about the Lord opening the windows
of heaven are true: the devourer has been rebuked, the fruits of our ground have not been
destroyed, and we have been a blessed family (Malachi 3:8-12).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Seek the blessings of an eternal family</span></p>
<p>A vision of what a family can be is taught in part with this truth: 
		<i>&#8220;And that same sociality which
exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which
glory we do not now enjoy&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 130:2). Family relationships that we
develop here will continue into the eternities.</p>
<p>The family is the basic unit in society. More important, it is the basic unit of eternity. 
		<i>&#8220;is central
to the Creator&#8217;s plan for the eternal destiny of His children&#8221; </i>(<i>The Family: A Proclamation to the
World</i>). The adversary is attacking the family like never before in the history of the world. And
not only is he attacking marriage and the family, but everything leading to it.</p>
<p>Recently, Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke of dating dying on many college campuses and being
replaced by &#8220;hanging out.&#8221; One recent U.S. study reports only 50% of women seniors were
asked out on six or more dates by men since coming to college. One-third of women had been
asked out on two or fewer dates. Male initiative in dating has declined dramatically. While
dating is much more common at the Church universities and institutes of religion, the reports
indicate that many women felt they did not date enough.</p>
<p>To the single young men, we hope your status is not permanent. To the young women, continue
to trust in the promises of the Lord. We remind you that a definition of dating is a man and a
woman paired together, often with other couples. It is usually something planned in advance, and
any expenses are usually paid for by the young man. We urge young men to take the initiative to
ask. Also, remember to make dating simple, inexpensive, and more frequent. At your age,
hopefully, you are settling down to begin the serious commitments that lead to temple marriage.</p>
<p>To those who are married, we remind you that your marriage will be successful to the degree that
you make Jesus Christ the center of your lives and by being, saying, and doing what He would.</p>
<p>Sister Jensen and I believe that you do not fall into love nor do you fall out of love. You either
work your way into love or you work your way out. Marriages succeed to the degree that couples
work at it in the Lord&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>I am reminded of a story told by a Seventy with whom I served in South America. He told of a
couple who had been married many years. He bought her a new stove for the kitchen. To get it to
work, you had to pump the fuel container. She tried, and it did not work. He took over and
applied too much pressure. The stove exploded, which blew them through the air a significant
distance. In fact, they landed in the middle of the city plaza. Astonished, the man saw his wife
seated with a huge smile on her face. Bewildered, he asked why she was smiling. She said, &#8220;I am
so happy! This is the first time in years that we have gone out together.&#8221; I am sure you see the
application that dating and courting precede and follow the marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>One of the most important foundation stones in your life has to be the resolve to marry in the
temple and keep the covenants you make there. Return to the temple often. Great are the
promises, the counsel, and the power coming from the ordinances and covenants of the holy
temple.</p>
<p>A treasured account in our family concerns the dating and marriage of my parents. My father
dropped out of school and left home at about age 16 to work on highway construction. At age 26
he was living in Wyoming and building a road. My mother, a recent high school graduate,
worked as a &#8220;soda jerk,&#8221; as they once were called, in her father&#8217;s drug store in Evanston,
Wyoming. My father had drifted from the Church. He drove into Evanston several times a week
to buy snacks and other things at my grandfather&#8217;s store and met my mother. A friendship
formed, they dated, courted and love developed.</p>
<p>At the right time, dad asked mother, &#8220;Will you marry me?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, Ruel, I will marry
you, but only in the temple.&#8221; He put his life in order, and about eight months later they were
sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on this very day, 19 August 1931. From these noble parents have
come 10 children, 51 grandchildren, 158 great-grandchildren and 28 great-great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>We pray that those who are not married will have this same resolve: &#8220;Yes, I will marry you, but
only in the temple!&#8221; Those who are married, may your resolve be &#8220;we will keep our marriage
covenants.&#8221;</p>
<p>A societal trend in marriage about which prophets have spoken is the delay and postponing of
marriage. The age at first marriage in the United States is increasing from age 23 for men and
age 20 for women in 1960 to 27 and 25, respectively, in recent years.</p>
<p>This is a very worrisome trend. One of the great blessings of our day is to have prophets and
seers who have clearly seen the societal enemies of our day. Their inspired teachings keep us and
our priorities in order about marriage and families, including <i>The Family: A Proclamation to the
World</i>, one of the most important prophetic declarations in your lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Be a person of integrity</span></p>
<p>The definition of <i>integrity</i> is <i>&#8220;uncompromising adherence to moral and ethical principles;
soundness of moral character; honesty; the state of being whole or entire; a sound or
unimpaired condition&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Random House Webster&#8217;s College Dictionary</span>, Second Edition). The
honor code at BYU-Idaho is inspired. It is designed to strengthen you spiritually in the restored
gospel, enlarge you intellectually, and build character, all of which leads to lifelong learning and
Christlike service. We trust that the principles, truths, and standards it establishes have become a
way of life for you.</p>
<p>Few messages from latter-day prophets have been more direct and precise than that of honor and
integrity. Some in the business world have a different value system. The lack of honesty is
manifest as ethical misconduct in some segments of the business world. It has become both more
prevalent and more visible in the scandals of prominent leaders in business and politics here and
abroad.</p>
<p>My first encounter with it occurred as I served as a mission president in South America. To
finalize the purchase of a building site for a meetinghouse in our mission, I was shocked by the
seller&#8217;s request. He said, &#8220;As we conclude this purchase, how much will we declare in the legal
documents and how much do we pass under the table so that I can avoid the high government
taxes?&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but this business transaction is over if that is how we have to do
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>A recent graduate from a Church university working in an accounting firm was censured for
honestly reporting his hours. His manager told him that if he worked eight hours he ought to bill
the company for ten. Are you prepared to stand up against these pressures?</p>
<p>Cheating and lying are becoming more common in amateur and professional sports, the news
media, and even the lives of common citizens. The likelihood of being caught, as well as the
penalties for doing so, has decreased.</p>
<p>We have every expectation that you have obeyed these truths in the honor code because they are
the foundation of a Christlike character, not only for the time enrolled here but for the rest of
your lives. You are true followers of Jesus Christ, His disciples under sacred covenant to be men
and women of honor and integrity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Thank God for the Ride</span></p>
<p>I like to look at life as chapters to a book. Today you close a very significant chapter of your life
and begin writing a new one. Some of you, perhaps all, have some anxiety, fears, and worries
about the future.</p>
<p>In a time of wars and much conflict in the Book of Mormon, not unlike our day, the Lord
revealed a great promise to Helaman and his army as they prayed and worried about their future:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances . . . ;
yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great
faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And we did take courage 
		</i>(Alma 58:11-12).</p>
<p>Peace, faith, courage&#8212;wonderful foundation stones for life.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has shared a wonderful insight from a newspaper article he read
about some who may think </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That marriage is a cottage surrounded by perpetual hollyhocks to which a
perpetually young and handsome husband comes home to a perpetually young
and [beautiful] wife. When the hollyhocks wither and boredom and bills appear
the divorce courts are jammed.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs
are more often dull than otherwise.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Life is like an old-time rail journey&#8212;delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and
jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of
speed.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride 
		</i>(Gordon B. Hinckley,
&#8220;A Conversation with Single Adults,&#8221; <i>Ensign</i>, Mar. 1997, 58).</p>
<p>With the help of parents, family, friends, priesthood leaders, teachers, and advisors, you have
examined and reexamined your foundation. Some stones were removed and were replaced by
others. I sincerely hope and pray that among your foundation stones are the four I have
mentioned today:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1. Increase in personal righteousness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2. Pay a full tithe and a generous offering.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">3. Seek the blessings of an eternal family</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">4. Be a person of integrity.</p>
<p>Rest assured that this Church is secure on the foundation of revelation, scriptures, priesthood and
keys, and ordinances and covenants. Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone.</p>
<p>As one of His Special Witnesses I testify that He lives. He and His Father appeared to and spoke
with Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is true. I have a witness of it and declare it to you. The
holy priesthood and associated keys are on the earth today. Prophets, seers, apostles, and
revelators hold all the keys of the kingdom today, with President Gordon B. Hinckley as the
senior apostle.</p>
<p>May God bless you as you go forward today, making your decisions and building your life in
harmony with and upon the right foundation, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I am grateful to each of you for attending devotional today.  It&#8217;s great to be here with you and
feel your enthusiasm and goodness.</p>
<p>In preparing what I could share with you today, I recall a piece of advice I received at devotional
when I was your age and attending BYU-Provo.  I don&#8217;t remember exactly which General
Authority gave this advice.  I think it was Marion D. Hanks, but I haven&#8217;t been able to verify
that.  I don&#8217;t know why the 14 words given were so deeply embedded in my memory.  I would
guess that there were angels watching over me who knew that the memory of those words would
influence generations of Clarks to come, so they sat on my shoulder and said:  &#8220;Remember this;
you&#8217;re going to really need this advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the advice:  &#8220;Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there.&#8221;  
		</p>
<p>Now, imagine that you&#8217;re me, back when I was your age.  And maybe it&#8217;s not so hard to imagine
because your own circumstances are probably a little bit similar.  At the time I so powerfully
internalized that advice, I worked for custodial services every day from 4 a.m. until 7 a.m. and
had scheduled my first class for 7 a.m.  It seemed logical at the time&#8212;since I was on campus
early, schedule all my classes early.  However, as you can guess, it wasn&#8217;t that easy; and the
temptation every day after work was to find an empty recliner or cot in one of the women&#8217;s
restrooms on campus and skip that first class.  If I did that and fell asleep, I could easily miss the
whole morning of classes.  So I had to resist the temptation and walk sleepily to class repeating
to myself, &#8220;Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was another more important way the advice influenced me.  Following the advice
helped me develop a pattern of always attending my church meetings.   I had followed that
pattern at home with my family, but now I was on my own, and I was tempted to sleep in on
Sundays.  Again I resisted the temptation and with those words echoing in my memory, I
attended Sacrament Meeting, Sunday School and Relief Society every Sunday.</p>
<p>I also attended my family home evening group meetings and activities regularly.  And I can tell
you that habit had direct positive impact on the lives of my children.  That&#8217;s literally true,
because it was in Family Home Evening group that I found my true love.  Where would our
children be today if I had skipped out on Family Home Evening?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Let me tell you of a time when having developed these habits was of particular importance.    I
was an exhausted mother of seven children, and the two oldest boys were not sure they wanted to
attend church.  It was difficult to get them and all the other children ready and out the door each
Sunday morning to be in sacrament meeting.  The stress was heightened by the fact that we
needed to be there a few minutes early as my calling at the time was sacrament meeting
chorister.  The stress was further heightened by the fact that President Clark served at that time
as the bishop of an inner-city ward and didn&#8217;t attend our meetings.  In fact, we didn&#8217;t see him all
day on Sundays.  Well, put yourself in my shoes again at that time.  I was tempted so often to
give up. I rationalized in my mind ways to get out of that stressful Sunday morning routine.  I
could take the children later, in time for Primary.  But the words rang loudly in my mind during
that time, &#8220;Be where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there.&#8221;  So with both
boys aboard, we went to church every Sunday.  What a blessing that has been in the lives of all
of my children&#8212;and especially in the lives of those reluctant sons who today attend church
regularly with their own young children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to pass this same advice on, so I say to you, &#8220;Be where you are supposed to be when you
are supposed to be there.&#8221;   Be there for all of your ward&#8217;s meetings and activities.  When you&#8217;re
supposed to be in class, be there.  When you&#8217;re supposed to be at family home evening, be there. 
Be there for your work and service commitments.  Be there for your roommates.  Go through
your day saying to yourself, &#8220;Where am I supposed to be?&#8221;  And then be there.  Developing and
keeping that habit will bless your lives and help to keep you on the straight and narrow path
where it is my prayer we will always be found.</p>
<p>Alma found the people of Gideon in those paths when he went to preach to them:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things?  Behold, I say unto
you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye believe
them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me.  And now because your
faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken,
great is my joy.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in
the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making
his paths straight.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word,
that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he
hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from
that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal
round</i> (Alma 7:17, 19&#8211;20).</p>
<p>It is my prayer that when we are sought by the prophets of God we will be found here at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho to be as the people of Gideon&#8212;steadfast on the path which leads to the kingdom of God. 
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </p>

</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to be with you today. We welcome you to the beginning of a
new semester at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. Since this is our first semester here, the opportunity to speak to you
at devotional is a special experience for us. We all stand at the beginning of an important season
in the growth and development of the kingdom of God in this part of the Lord&#8217;s vineyard. There
is a great work that lies just ahead for this university, and there is a great work ahead for you.
The way forward will not be without challenge and difficulty. Yet, for the university and for us
personally, the solution is the same:  the solution is obedience to the commandments of the Lord.
Obedience brings to each of us the great blessings of the Savior.</p>
<p>Down through the ages the prophets have sought to teach us about the importance of obedience
in the great plan of salvation. One of the most powerful metaphors for obedience in all of
scripture is the strait and narrow path. Let&#8217;s turn to 2 Nephi 31:18-20. Listen how Nephi
describes the path and our journey. After we have entered in by the gate, which is faith in Jesus
Christ, repentance, and baptism by water and by the Spirit, we are in the strait and narrow path.
Here is Nephi:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow
path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . . Wherefore, ye must</i>
<span style="font-weight: bold">press forward with a steadfastness in Christ</span><i>, having a
perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men</i> (2 Nephi 31:19-20,
emphasis added).</p>
<p>Pressing forward with steadfastness in Christ&#8212;to strive to do what the Lord wants you to do in
all circumstances, to press forward no matter what happens, even when you slip or fall, to get
back up and move forward, to never give up; to recognize that there is always hope; to put at the
center of your life the only One who has all power over all things, the only One who can reach
out and save you if you will follow Him with a perfect brightness of hope . . . that is what it
means to be obedient. </p>
<p>Nephi&#8217;s language makes clear that the path and the way are not going to be easy. He knew
whereof he spoke. He not only had known turmoil and hardship and opposition in his own life,
but he also had seen in powerful vision the great panorama of Lehi&#8217;s dream, with its tree of life,
the strait and narrow path, the iron rod, the mists of darkness, and the great and spacious
building. Nephi had seen that the fruit of the tree <i>&#8220;is the most desirable above all things. . . . Yea,
and the most joyous to the soul&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 11:22-23). He saw that many 
		<i>&#8220;who had commenced in
the path did lose their way&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 8:23) because the mists of darkness or 
		<i>&#8220;the temptations of
the devil . . . leadeth them away into <span style="font-weight: bold">broad roads</span>, that they perish and are lost&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 12:17,
emphasis added). Nephi saw the compelling power of the great and spacious building that stood
high above the earth. <i>&#8220;It was filled with people . . . in the attitude of mocking and pointing their
fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 8:27). He saw
that those who grasped the iron rod made it to the tree and tasted of the fruit. But even then some
were ashamed <i>&#8220;because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">forbidden
paths</span> and were lost&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 8:28, emphasis added). And, of course, many never started on the
path and <i>&#8220;were lost from his view, wandering in 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">strange roads</span>&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 8:32, emphasis added).</p>
<p>From these passages we learn three very important, even lifesaving, principles:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1. The tree of life and its precious fruit are part of our mortal journey.</span></p>
<p>The fruit of the tree, and all that it represents&#8212;salvation, joy, redemption, and the love of God
that never faileth&#8212;comes in and through Jesus Christ. Partaking of the fruit is not ultimate
salvation. We may partake of the fruit here and now while we are still on the journey. And we
may experience all that the tree represents in this life, if we stay on the strait and narrow path.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2. The way is fraught with peril, and there are many competing paths.</span></p>
<p>The temptations of the devil obscure the path and draw confused travelers into strange roads that
are broad, even after they have started on the straight and narrow path. One might imagine these
broad roads crossing the strait and narrow path, creating many crossroads and many choices. At
times, the broad roads may even run parallel to the strait and narrow path. (After all, the devil is
the father of lies and a master of disguise and counterfeit.)  The strait and narrow path does not
exist in isolation. There are many travelers and many roads.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">3. The iron rod, the word of God, is sure and true and leads to the tree of life.</span></p>
<p>In his dream Lehi sees that those who grasped the rod and held on could make it through the
mists of darkness, avoid all of those other roads, and reach the tree of life. But even then the time
of testing and probation is not finished. Even then, especially then, we must be diligent and
vigilant in keeping the commandments of God. Even after we have journeyed on the strait and
narrow path, even after we have partaken of the fruit of the tree, forbidden paths and strange
roads beckon us. The pride of men and the vain things of the world in the great and spacious
building loom over us and, to some, appear attractive. But the forbidden paths only lead to
destruction. Like the broad roads, they are a counterfeit and their promises are hollow.</p>
<p>Let me share an experience I had when I was about your age that illustrates the choices we face,
the broad roads that beckon, and the importance of choosing the strait and narrow path. When I
was in high school in Spokane, Washington, I played in a rock band. My friends and I started the
band when we were sophomores. By the time we were seniors, we had become pretty good. We
started getting jobs to play at dances and began writing our own songs. </p>
<p>In January of my senior year, we were invited to play in a big battle of the bands sponsored by
the most popular radio station in Spokane. The contest was held in a big teen club. We practiced
really hard and played really well that night. And we won!  It was amazing. All of those kids out
there in the audience were screaming at us. We had visions of record contracts and big concerts.
It was pretty exciting. </p>
<p>On the way home that night, one of my friends turned to me and said, &#8220;You know, you are
becoming two people. You&#8217;re really different when you are around the band.&#8221;  As we talked, I
knew what she said was true. As I thought about it, I realized that I 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">was</span> becoming two people.
One person was the young man my parents thought they were rearing: very active in the Church,
a leader in my quorums, an Eagle Scout, preparing to serve a mission, a good student, and a
varsity athlete in two sports. The other person was the aspiring rock star&#8212;sarcastic, cynical, and
arrogant. And I was hanging around with a lot of people who were definitely not on the strait and
narrow path. Actually, these people were way off the strait and narrow path, wandering in
strange roads.</p>
<p>And so I faced a choice. The two people I was becoming were incompatible with each other. I
could not be both for very long. I had to choose. I remember very clearly what it felt like to make
that decision. I knew deep in my heart that I wanted to be what the Lord wanted me to be. I had
tried to live in both worlds, but I knew I could not do that any longer. I needed to repent of pride
and arrogance and of the way I had treated people. So I quit the band. At the very moment when
all the hard work was paying off, when all the dreams and hopes were coming true, I up and quit.
And I did not drag it out. I called up my friends and told them I was finished with the band. They
were shocked. They thought I had lost my mind. But, in fact, I had found my heart and my soul.
Looking back across these many years since that moment, I know I was guided by the Spirit and
blessed to make that decision. I chose the strait and narrow path and turned my back on the lure
of the great and spacious building. I said no to the broad roads and the forbidden paths that
beckoned.</p>
<p>The strait and narrow path with the iron rod is a powerful metaphor. It teaches true principles
and focuses our attention on that which matters most in obtaining salvation: faith in the Savior,
hope in His Atonement, obedience to His commandments, pressing forward no matter what. 
		</p>
<p>Without in any way diminishing its power and importance, I would like to marry Nephi&#8217;s
metaphor of the iron rod and the strait and narrow path to another image given us by another
prophet, seer, and revelator in our day. I think in so doing we may see new dimensions of the
journey and gain deeper understanding of what we must do to obtain eternal life. The metaphor I
have in mind was given to us by Elder Bruce R. McConkie in a talk he gave in general
conference in the fall of 1984. Let&#8217;s listen to Elder McConkie:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Church is like a great caravan&#8212;organized, prepared, following an appointed
course, with its captains of ten and captains of hundreds in place.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>What does it matter if a few barking dogs snap at the heels of the weary
travelers?  Or that predators claim those few who fall by the way? The caravan
moves on.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Is there a ravine to cross, a miry mud hole to pull through, a steep grade to
climb?  So be it. The oxen are strong and the teamsters wise. The caravan moves
on.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Are there storms that rage along the way, floods that wash away the bridges,
deserts to cross, rivers to ford?  Such is life in the fallen sphere. The caravan
moves on.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Ahead is the celestial city, the eternal Zion of our God, where all who maintain
their position in the caravan shall find food and drink and rest. Thank God that
the caravan moves on!</i>  (Bruce R. McConkie, <i>The Caravan Moves On</i>, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>,
November 1984, p. 82)</p>
<p>Consider that the &#8220;appointed course&#8221; in Elder McConkie&#8217;s metaphor is the strait and narrow
path. When we enter the gate of that path we not only embark on the strait and narrow path but
we become members of the Church. We grasp the iron rod and join the caravan of the Lord. In
Elder McConkie&#8217;s world, the strait and narrow path is not smooth. To the mists of darkness and
the many broad, strange, and forbidden paths, he has added ravines, and mud and rivers to cross.
But the implication is the same: if we hold fast to the iron rod, if we obey the commandments of
the Lord and stay with the caravan, we shall obtain salvation.</p>
<p>Combined in this way the metaphors of the iron rod, the strait and narrow path, and the caravan
bring The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the heart of our journey. I think there
are three aspects of the Church that help us in powerful ways to not only reach the tree of life,
but also partake of the fruit forever.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Prophets of God lead the caravan.</span></p>
<p>It is the Lord&#8217;s caravan, and He speaks through the President of the Church to guide and direct
its progress. Moreover, the Prophet, the counselors in the First Presidency, and the members of
the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles hold the priesthood keys, authority, and power required to
move the caravan forward on the course the Lord has set. These great principles of revelation
and priesthood authority establish an overriding fact about the caravan:  it is always on the strait
and narrow path. We have, then, a sure guide to salvation. If we come to points in our lives
where the way ahead is not clear, where the mists of darkness obscure the path, where competing
paths clamor for attention, where we feel weak or discouraged, we can pray and seek direction of
the Spirit, we can hold fast to the iron rod, and we can look to the direction of the caravan and
follow the Brethren. The caravan always moves forward on the strait and narrow path.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2. In the caravan of the Lord, we travel in the communities of Zion.</span></p>
<p>In the caravan we travel in families, in wards, in stakes, in the communities of Zion. Thus, in the
Church we are bound together in mutual commitments to love and serve one another. These
mutual commitments are crucial when someone we love encounters problems, or begins to waver
in their faith, or succumbs to temptation or drifts away from the caravan. The Lord reaches out
through us to support them, to sustain them, and to go after them. Family members are always
the first line of love and support. But in the Lord&#8217;s church there are captains of tens and captains
of hundreds (see Deuteronomy 1:15, Doctrine and Covenants 136:3, 15)&#8212;bishops, Relief
Society presidents, quorum presidents, home teachers, visiting teachers, youth leaders&#8212;who
reach out and love and support us and seek to bring back into the caravan those who have
wandered. We also reach out to those who are not members of the caravan who are seeking the
truth and long for the peace and joy and salvation to be found in the kingdom of God. This work
of supporting one another and reaching out for one another is a sacred commitment that is
organized and directed by the Lord through His chosen servants. That spirit of commitment and
love and support is present on this campus. This university is a community of Zion, and the
Spirit of Ricks makes BYU-Idaho a special place. For you and for me, living in the communities
of Zion is one of the great blessings of the strait and narrow path and the caravan of the Lord.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Life in the caravan establishes an architecture of righteousness.</span></p>
<p>Daily life in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is highly structured. It begins with
covenants made with God. Those covenants are commitments we make to live our lives in
accordance with the commandments of God. These covenants and commandments create what I
call an architecture of righteousness&#8212;a framework for our daily lives. The elements of this
framework include personal and family prayer, study of the scriptures, adherence to the word of
wisdom and to the law of chastity, the payment of tithes and offerings, keeping the Sabbath day
holy, attending the temple, service in callings in the Church and participation in our appointed
meetings. At this university, the Honor Code is based on gospel principles and provides another
important element of the framework for daily life. As we organize our lives around these
fundamental activities, we create a structure of righteousness that guides, protects, and supports
us in our journey on the strait and narrow path in the caravan of the Lord.</p>
<p>I would like to apply these principles to your personal journey and your time at this university by
focusing on one of the commandments that defines the architecture of righteousness in your
lives: keeping the Sabbath day holy. To begin, let&#8217;s turn first to Exodus chapter 20, verses 8-11.</p>
<p>This is the commandment given to Moses:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any
work . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,
and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and
hallowed it.</i></p>
<p>Sunday is the Sabbath day of the Lord. The commandment to keep the Sabbath day holy has
been repeated and given a powerful statement in the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph
Smith. Please turn with me to section 59 in the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>Now, my brothers and sisters, this revelation was given in 1831, many years ago. But today I
would like you to see that the words here are meant for you. Let&#8217;s read verses 9 and 10 and verse
13:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt
go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay
thy devotions unto the Most High;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with
singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy
may be full.</i></p>
<p>May I come back to verse 9?  Look at the phrase &#8220;that thou mayest more fully keep thyself
unspotted from the world.&#8221;  Keeping the Sabbath day holy will help us stand clean and pure
before the Lord, and thus, be worthy of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.
Moreover, keeping this commandment will be a protection to us. There is much evil in the world
and much that would take us away from the peace and joy Heavenly Father has prepared for us.
If we keep the Sabbath day holy, we shall enjoy these blessings. Treat the Sabbath as a special
day, the Lord&#8217;s day. Clean up your apartments on Saturday in preparation for the Lord&#8217;s day.
Dress appropriately, all day long, in honor of the Lord. Fill the Sabbath day with those things
that will bring the Spirit into your life: attending Church; visiting the sick; studying the
scriptures; writing letters; writing in your journal; doing family history; home teaching;
missionary work; reading; visiting with friends; listening to sacred music; singing sacred music;
praying. There are so many wonderful things to do that will bring you closer to God and more
fully keep you unspotted from the world.</p>
<p>It takes faith to keep the Sabbath day holy, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We keep this
commandment because we have faith that it came from Him. We have faith that He was the
Creator, that He gave the commandment to Moses, that He reaffirmed it to Joseph Smith, and
that He is the one who gave us the promises. We keep it because we love Him, and trust Him,
and have our hope in Him. Moreover, we have faith in the promises He has given us. When we
see the Sabbath in this way, it is a cause to rejoice!</p>
<p>Please look at verse 15 in section 59:  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and
countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a
cheerful countenance&#8212;</i></p>
<p>When I was a boy, I knew Sundays were different and I knew they were special. I didn&#8217;t always
like not being able to do the things my friends did. When I went to Boston in 1967 to go to
school, I had a pretty difficult time. I was far away from home, living in a strange place, among
people that were very different from me. But there was one place, and one day of the week,
where I felt at home. And that was going to church and being with the Latter-day Saints on the
Sabbath day. When I was 18 years old I learned to love Sundays. I truly rejoiced when it was
Sunday and I could go to church; and I had a deep sense of gratitude for the Lord, the Church,
and my brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the Lord wants us to do. The Lord, in fact, wants us to keep the Sabbath as a
day of rejoicing, and thanksgiving, and good cheer.</p>
<p>Again from section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants, consider these words from verses 16-21.
Speaking of keeping the Sabbath day holy, the Lord says:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fullness of the earth is yours . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the
benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man . . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save
those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.</i></p>
<p>The revelation is clear:  keeping the Sabbath day holy means that we recognize and acknowledge
the Lord&#8217;s hand in all things. We cannot confess his hand in all things unless we keep the
Sabbath day holy. Keeping the Sabbath day holy is about giving thanks to God, it is about
gratitude and our love for Him. It is about rejoicing in the marvelous blessings of the Savior and
His Atonement. It is about deep, spiritual peace that comes from obedience. </p>
<p>Now I know some of you may feel pressure to work on Sundays, or to shop or participate in
recreational activities. Our society makes these things attractive and even compelling. But the
promises of the Lord are real. I bear testimony that they are true promises. And they are for you.
If you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will feel the Spirit of the Lord more fully in your life. You
will have more guidance, more support, and more peace. And the Lord will pour out blessings
upon you. I do not say that all your problems will disappear. I only promise you that the Lord
will pour out blessings upon you. Read the scripture; read it as a message to you; read what it
says. The Lord means what He says.</p>
<p>And so, we return to where we started, to the blessings of the Savior. We have talked today
about commandments and about obedience. I want you to know that behind and in and around
those commandments there is the love and the mercy and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. He
stands with arms outstretched all the day long. I know He loves you with a love that never
faileth. Brothers and sisters, the Atonement is real. I bear solemn witness that the Savior lives,
that in Him and through Him we can receive forgiveness and peace and joy and salvation.</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to read a scripture from another day that is particularly important on this
day in your life. It comes from Alma&#8217;s great final address to his son Helaman:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to
keep the commandments of God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, and cry unto God for 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> thy support; yea, let 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> thy doings be unto the Lord,
and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> thy thoughts be
directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord
forever.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Counsel with the Lord in 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea,
when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you
in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks
unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day</i> (Alma
37:35-37, emphasis added).</p>
<p>I pray that we may all take this scripture to heart and put the Lord at the center of our lives. I
pray that we may all walk the strait and narrow path, in the caravan of the Lord. What a
marvelous blessing it is, my brothers and sisters, to live in a day when the caravan of the Lord is
here, moving forward in its strength and in its fullness. I thank God for Joseph Smith, the great
Prophet of the Restoration; and for Gordon B. Hinckley, the Prophet of the Lord today; and for
all the Prophets and Apostles who lead the Lord&#8217;s Church. I am grateful for the communities of
Zion, for sacred covenants and commandments, for the architecture of righteousness in our daily
lives.</p>
<p>Most of all, I am grateful for the Lord Jesus Christ, for His love, and for the matchless power of
His Atonement. Let us be diligent in keeping His commandments. Let us create an architecture
of righteousness by keeping the Sabbath day holy, and indeed, striving to keep all the
commandments, and to live the gospel in its fullness. Let us all learn wisdom and make
obedience the hallmark of our lives. I know that if we do so, God will bless us and keep us. I
know that in obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ there is life and
hope and salvation. The promises are sure. I bear witness that it is so, in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A BYU football player sat on the bench every game for nearly three years. I was especially
interested because his father and I had been missionaries together and I knew the boy.
Commitment and patience paid off when this young man, Brandon Doman, found himself as the
starting quarterback in the final game of the season against the University of Utah. Some of you
may have seen the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">With less than a minute to go BYU was behind. After a sack it was 4<sup>th</sup> down and 13. The
Cougars had 83 yards to go for a winning touchdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That seemed an impossible situation: a new quarterback, the team back against a wall, too little
time, and only one down left for long yardage to keep even a remote chance of winning alive. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Think of the pressure. Think of the opportunity. Brandon stepped into a dejected huddle and
said, &#8220;Alright you guys, this is what it is all about! Everyone do his job and let&#8217;s win this game!&#8221; 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The team left the huddle focused and resolute, empowered by renewed vision and by someone
they trusted. Brandon called the play and completed a very difficult 34 yard pass on the sideline.
First down. Then, another pass for 36 yards. On fourth down Brandon plunged through the Ute
defenses for a touchdown to send Coach Edwards into retirement a winner. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am going to visit with you about leadership under the title of &#8220; Will you Lead?&#8221; &#8220;These I Will
Make My Rulers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My great grandmother, Ann Fall, was an English convert who moved with the Saints to Zion.
She lived an impoverished life, before and after her husband was scalped and killed. She cared
for her eight children essentially alone in a small cabin that never had more than a dirt floor and
a sod roof. In the midst of her isolation and despair she received a very short but amazing
patriarchal blessing that said, in part, &#8220;Your name shall be held in honorable remembrance in
future generations,&#8221; a highly improbable prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Ann Fall taught her children the faith that she embraced. She lived the gospel and focused on
sustaining and influencing her family. She is buried in an obscure grave atop a little hill. Her
posterity includes hundreds, faithful mothers and fathers, missionaries, teachers, bishops,
mission presidents, temple presidents. Two have served as General Authorities; another was
Governor of the state of Utah. Does Ann Fall fit your image of a leader? She fits mine and we
hold her in honorable remembrance as her righteous influence continues today and will into the
eternities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Gordon B. Hinckley is not only President of the Church, he is also an incredible
personal leader. President Hinckley has had a lot of years to develop from when I first dealt with
him in 1958. I was a student walking on a dusty gravel road where a speeding car passed several
times and then skidded to a stop next to me. The driver rolled down his window. I recognized
him as the newest General Authority, Elder Hinckley. He was obviously frustrated and said that
he was lost, already late for a meeting, and that he needed directions. I told him where to go. He
thanked me, spun gravel, and kicked up more dust that left me coughing as he hurried on his
way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Many years later I said to him, &#8220;President, you are doing a good job.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, I am doing
my best.&#8221; He is an authentic, humble leader who has paid attention, caught on, and step by step
built a record of accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley works hard. I got a telephone call from Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin early one
Monday morning. I asked him where he was calling from. He said from his office. I asked,
&#8220;Why are you calling from your office on a Monday, this is your day off, your Saturday.
Besides, you were in Hong Kong yesterday helping to dedicate the temple there.&#8221; Elder Wirthlin
said that he had returned to Salt Lake with the president late the night before, exhausted, but that
he awoke with the thought, &#8220;President Hinckley will be at his office by 7!&#8221; So, he said, &#8220;I got up,
dressed, and hurried to my office. I shouldn&#8217;t be outworked by President Hinckley!&#8221; 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley is a doer, a man of vision, decisive. He listens to the Spirit and the counsel of
others. Karen and I were with him when the Lord put into his mind having 100 temples before he
died. Once that inspiration came, he got busy and built more temples. We are all blessed by
President Hinckley&#8217;s personal leadership.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Leadership: Personal Power and Righteous Influence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Leadership is in high demand and generally in short supply. The greatest need of this growing
church, President Hinckley has said, is for leaders. Freedom and democracy require a broad base
of leaders. Business will not emerge and become profitable without leaders. Every family needs
leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have studied the leadership of thousands, including U. S. presidents and presidential
candidates. In recent times my interests and private writings have more and more involved
doctrines and principles of leadership. Think about one of my conclusions: <i>The requirements for
exaltation in the Celestial kingdom are essentially the same as the requirements for leadership.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">For instance, trust is the first principle of leadership. Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan for mortality deals
first with trust. As we are obedient Heavenly Father can trust us and we can trust each other. We
cannot trust telestial souls at all. We can trust terrestrial folks with temporal matters. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our readiness for leadership rises with our level of obedience to God&#8217;s commandments. Our
ultimate and unlimited potential for leadership comes because we are the sons or daughters of
the most powerful and influential leader in the universe. We carry Heavenly Father&#8217;s &#8220;spiritual
DNA&#8221; and, therefore, each one of us may qualify as a natural born leader. 
		</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Jesus Christ is the model of our potential</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Jesus has been called the perfect leader. In the little book 
		<i>Lectures on Faith</i>, Joseph Smith
explains the Savior&#8217;s perfect leadership. No power is greater than His. He knows all things. His
love for us is perfect. He reconciles the demands of eternal law and mercy. He connects vision
and reality with perfect strategy. His ideas about alliances are reflected in the Godhead,
presidencies, quorums, and councils. Thus, we can trust Him, faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">God&#8217;s desire is for each one of us to become like him. Jesus asked a question: 
		<i>&#8220;. . . what manner
of men ought ye to be?&#8221;</i> And then gave His response, <i>&#8220;Verily I say unto you, even as I am&#8221;</i> (3
Nephi 27:27).  Abraham describes Jesus&#8217; leadership that we are to emulate: 
		<i>&#8220;I rule in the heaven
above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom and prudence, over all the intelligences . . .&#8221;</i>
(Abraham 3:21)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He is not talking here about personally being the best engineer to construct worlds. He can deal
with that, but His supremacy and leadership are with his family, his intelligent posterity. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The following scripture might be talking about you: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were
organized before the world was [that&#8217;s you]; and among all these there were
many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these souls that they were good . .
. and he said: These I will make my rulers . . . and he said unto me: Abraham . . .
thou was chosen before thou wast born</i> (Abraham 3:22-23).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I first read about Abraham&#8217;s vision while I was a young boy. I knew that Abraham was not there
all alone. I wondered to myself, &#8220;Was I there?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know. But, this is what I thought: 
		<i>I do
not know if I was there as a potential ruler, but it would be far better for me to assume that I was
there and be wrong, rather than to assume that I was</i> not<i> there and be wrong!</i></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Identity as a leader</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we lose the vision of our potential we might fall short of our possibilities. My grandmother
might have become depressed. Brandon Doman could have been overcome by the obstacles.
President Hinckley could have become a pessimist in the middle of the worst depression in the
history of America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Please don&#8217;t get mixed up about who you are and your future!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The movie, 
		<i>Seabiscuit</i>, tells the story of two horses that dominated race tracks across America in
the 1930s. Eventually these two great horses, Seabiscuit and War Admiral, ran against each other
in what was called the &#8220;race of the century.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I had a horse named Champ who was Seabiscuit&#8217;s cousin and War Admiral&#8217;s nephew. Champ&#8217;s
story unfolded when he disappeared from our farm in Washington State when I was fourteen.
We searched for weeks and concluded that he had been stolen. I could not accept him being
gone, and decided to make one more effort to find him. I borrowed a horse, started near dawn
and rode for hours into high country and rough grazing lands miles away where I had earlier
chased wild horses. On my way I kept thinking about how a few years before we had found and
bought Champ as a wild undisciplined yearling in Idaho foothills, never before touched by
human hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The frigid air was warmed as the sun moved high in the sky. That was when I saw specks in the
far distance, then movement, and eventually Champ with a band of about a dozen wild horses. I
could not believe that Champ had run away. I was chasing this marvelous coal black horse
whose grandfather, Man &#8216;O War, had won the Kentucky Derby. Now, with me in hot pursuit, he
was running loose with a bunch of reckless mustangs, risking his life racing on uneven rocky
terrain as wild as the first time ever I saw him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I finally caught Champ as the sun was setting and took him home. I resumed riding him to drive
range cattle out of our crops. He carried rodeo queens, pleased crowds at parades, and won a
blue ribbon at the fair. (I was saddened to learn that the other horses that Champ ran around with
for awhile were rounded up and became dog meat.)  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Please do not lose sight of your potential. I have thought how, like Champ, some resist the truth
of who they are and what they should do with their lives. You will not want to run away from
your royal inheritance, or become distracted by fickle or forbidden things.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Stand aligned with others of righteous power and influence</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Leadership always involves other people. In order to lead we must be linked with helping allies.
No leader is an island. I learned something about friends and allies as I first entered BYU in
Provo. I was seventeen and a stranger among thousands of new students. On the first day of the
school year I prayed to know how to survive my obscurity. That prayer was answered as a quiet
voice spoke to my mind, &#8220;<i>Be their helping friend</i>.&#8221; I decided right then that I would look people
in the eye, smile, say hello, and remember faces and names. From the results of that decision
those students elected me their class president and many of us have been helpful allies to each
other ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The decision to be a helping friend might seem to some of you a little elementary. For me, that
one early decision about making friends became highly relevant throughout my entire life,
including during a drizzly evening on the other side of the world about forty years after my first
day at BYU. I was serving in Sydney, Australia when Pope John Paul II came to town. I was
invited to join religious leaders to welcome him. We were roped off from the hundreds of
thousands who had gathered and were provided seats near the stand. The Pope was late and my
colleagues of other faiths in their impressive robes and regalia were just sitting around and
waiting. It was most natural for me to take initiative, shake hands with row after row of these
high ranking religious officials, introduce myself, and thank them for coming. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I was finishing with the last row of dignitaries, a man who had been watching me came down
off the stand and asked who I was. I learned that he was a senior Catholic Cardinal, the third
ranking man in the entire Roman Catholic Church worldwide. He asked if we could talk more
and invited me to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our friendship led to several trips to the Vatican and many hours of candid and enlightening
conversation. This Cardinal told me that before my arrival he spoke with every senior officer of
their church and that I was their first contact ever with a LDS official. Our association led to
friendships with others at the Vatican and around the world, including extended personal
involvement with LDS matters by Cardinal Ratzinger, who is now Pope Benedict XVI. We are
now known and trusted at the Vatican and have been singled out and given access to the most
ancient and precious religious documents found in the Vatican archives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Can you safely conclude that making friends is a small thing? Please don&#8217;t risk it. We seldom
know how Heavenly Father will use us as we respond to his subtle directions in our lives. 
		</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Available to lead</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My early thoughts about rulers and leaders were also influenced by President J. Reuben Clark,
Jr. He was sustained as second counselor in the First Presidency after serving for years as first
counselor to two previous presidents. In response to what some perceived as a demotion,
President Clark told the church that it is &#8220;not where we serve, but how.&#8221; 
		<i>We are not responsible
to be called to any particular office or undertaking in the church, but we are by covenant fully
responsible to be worthy, able, and willing to accept any possible calling or release from the
Lord at any time in our lives.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our attitudes about serving in the Lord&#8217;s work ought to follow the example of President Kim
Clark&#8217;s recent call to preside over this university. The Harvard Business School where President
Clark has been the dean stands at the pinnacle of business education and my profession. The
		<i>Boston Globe</i> reported on what seemed to them to have been a remarkable decision. Their article
said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . [President Gordon B.] Hinckley called Clark . . . to ask him to leave his post
as dean of Harvard Business School and take a job heading a Mormon college in
Idaho. Clark knew the answer before Hinckley posed the question. The answer
was yes. And now Clark, who at Harvard holds one of the loftiest jobs in
academe, is heading off to Rexburg, Idaho, to become president of the newest
outpost of Mormon higher education: Brigham Young University Idaho, a proud
name for a campus that until four years ago was a two-year institution knows as
Ricks College. . . .</i> (Michael Poulson, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, no date. Reprinted in
		<i>Deseret Morning News</i>, July 9, 2005, page E2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Clark also is quoted as saying that his call from President Hinckley was akin to getting
a call from Moses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Like the Clarks, we will have personal testimony stories about callings, but likely less public.
Indulge me one obscure personal growth experience on this point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In our early married years we moved to LA to enroll at USC for full-time doctoral studies. I also
had a demanding full-time job and was recovering from being hospitalized several times,
including for some tough surgery. We were still in our twenties and far from family while we
struggled through a fifth very difficult pregnancy, and then the death of a child. While still
wondering how we could possibly carry on I was called to serve as bishop. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This calling could not have come at a more difficult time. Of course, we accepted. My doctoral
chairman, the dean who was the national president of my profession, was very upset. He said I
would never finish my studies and he wrote me off. We grew much in those years and Karen and
I witnessed many miracles with our service and studies. I earned the education and credentials
on schedule, plus got praise and support from my former critic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We do not seek callings and we do not decide where and when we serve. We already made our
decisions with sacred covenants. Furthermore, we are obligated to be worthy at all times, and to
be as capable and qualified as possible for any responsibility. We are also to be free from
entanglements that would restrict our service, such as excessive debt, legal troubles, or a
negative image or reputation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Please, will you be worthy, willing and prepared to serve where and when the Lord wants you.

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">The power of the priesthood through leadership</span><span style="font-weight: bold">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We can, in a roundabout way, better understand leadership by pointing to Satan as the exact
opposite of a leader, the perfect despicable example of what leadership is not! His premortal
proposal to save all humankind was not benevolent and it was not leadership. His proposal was
inoperative; it could never have worked. His tactics then and now completely ignore the
intelligent nature of God&#8217;s children. His plan of force violated individual moral agency. His
demand for honor and glory disregarded the fact that authority and power cannot be given like a
latch key, or an office with a name on the door. His was the most inept and unrealistic proposal
ever made in the history of the universe. He sought to overthrow the Father and enslave his
family, to impose forcible control and compulsory means. Satan is altogether devoid of
leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In stark contrast to unrighteous forms of control, the eternal power of the priesthood is found in
&#8220;<i>invit[ing]</i> <i>all to come unto Christ,</i>&#8221; (Doctrine and covenants 20:59) for that is the church
mission. To invite with &#8220;will you?&#8221; is the pattern of divine leadership. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To 
		<i>&#8220;invite all to come unto Christ&#8221;</i> implements the most profound mission statement I have ever
known. It represents both the end results of our leadership and the process of leading. The
inviting we do should help others come unto Christ, such as &#8220;Will you be baptized? Will you
come for an interview for the Melchizedek priesthood? Will you come to the temple?&#8221; Or
perhaps &#8220;Will you come with me to our fireside?&#8221; &#8220;Will you help me?&#8221; &#8220;Will you pray with
me?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Will you?&#8221; respects human intelligence and activates moral agency. It is precisely that power
and influence Heavenly Father wants us to learn and exercise as we labor in both temporal and
spiritual matters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Inviting with &#8220;Will you?&#8221; rather than &#8220;You will!&#8221; is at the heart of leading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Heavenly Father&#8217;s perspective on leadership</span><span style="font-weight: bold">
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">All true leadership is close to divine. President Thomas S. Monson wrote<i> &#8220; . . . of all the
blessings I have had in my life, one of the sweetest is that feeling the Lord provides when I know
that he has answered the prayer of another person through me&#8221;</i> (<i>Ensign</i>, December 2004, p. 41).
You may have those same sweet feelings. The Spirit will teach you what you need to know,
helping you to see what needs to be done, prompting you to take initiative, and alerting you to
allies, The Spirit will tutor you in your individual circumstances and opportunities. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder Neal A. Maxwell was an exemplary leader who listened and acted on the Spirit. He set
Sister Merrell apart as a missionary and then, after pausing a moment, responded to what only
she and the Spirit knew and said, &#8220;Sister Merrell, regarding your early morning private prayers .
. .&#8221; Elder Maxwell then gave Karen specific Apostolic promises and blessings, answering her
pre-dawn secretly and prayerfully expressed concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Your leadership is best a partnership between heaven and earth as angels are assigned and
minister to you in your unique challenges and opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Jesus Christ knows your circumstances and the needs for your leadership now and into the
eternities. In Section 121, verses 29-32 we are told about &#8220;<i>thrones and dominions, principalities
and powers</i>&#8221; that shall be given to those who are valiant according to ordinations and
preparations before this world was. That is talking of your potential &#8211; thrones, dominions,
principalities, powers &#8211; that you are now working toward. The Lord finishes that revelation with
a promise that as we seek power and influence for righteous purposes the </span>

scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting
dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 121: 46).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Just imagine this promise that righteous power and influence will flow to you naturally, without
compulsory means, forever and ever. I hope you believe that, for that is the nature and
magnitude of the influence that Heavenly Father has in mind for you.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Growing as leaders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Is there anything you can do to best obtain the capacity to rule and reign? The truth is that we
grow into leadership. The power to lead is not conferred nor given by edict or authority. Ann
Fall was not automatically a leader by giving birth to a child. Brother Doman was not a leader
just because he was in the huddle. Elder Hinckley was not influential simply because of hands
laid on his head. The capacity to lead comes by nurturing the seeds of divine potential within us,
line upon line, becoming tomorrow more than we are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Authority, legal authority, for an office, we all know, is conferred at times by ordination or
settings apart. Then comes the opportunity to magnify the calling through leadership. Section 84
tells how to learn to lead in the Lord&#8217;s eternal kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To receive all that the Father hath, including growing in our capacity to lead first comes with
receiving God&#8217;s servants who then help us to receive the Father and the Son. The servants we are
to learn from are those among us who teach, interview us, counsel and correct us, extend
callings, and to whom we return and report. These servants we are to receive and learn from
could include parents, ward officers, teachers, living prophets, and inspired associates. And, 
those servants we receive include the angels who give us personal, customized, and &#8220;just in
time&#8221; help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We learn to receive all that the Father hath by being meek, submissive, diligent, patient, and
kind. We receive the Father by praying, magnifying our callings, and not having to be
commanded in all things. Essential sacrifice and consecration are represented by being frugal,
generous, diligent, hard working. Being tired and feeling unwell are no excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Thus we grow and eventually may take the place and undertake the work of a leader in mortality
and in the realm of our appointed dominions forever and ever.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Prepare as high potential leaders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some of you are saying to yourselves that you are not a leader; mentally arguing that you are not
that type of person; in fact, that you would rather be a follower and lay low. Satan is a liar,
telling you that you are stuck the way you are, limited in potential, unworthy of God&#8217;s promises. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The truth is that not one of you is lost or without royal potential! Jesus Christ has rescued you
from yourself already if you will truly accept him. You are here at this university to become
competent and trusted to labor and lead in some arena. You all are aware of the folly of
cramming and the advantages of being prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I learned something of preparation many years ago, fresh out of school. A partner and I were
pleased when the White House took note of our work identifying and coaching high potential
leaders. The president&#8217;s staff asked for a proposal from us within a few days to help follow up on
the State of the Union address scheduled for the next week. As it turned out our proposal was
soon the heart of a Presidential Executive Order mandated for implementation by the entire
Federal government. When the request came from the president&#8217;s office, there was no time for
more preparation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To paraphrase President Howard W. Hunter, if you want to get in the game put your shoes on
before the coach calls for you. Your years in school can be an important part of your preparation
for leadership. The entire program of this university, everything here is to nurture graduates of
nobility who are visionary about life, skilled in leadership principles, and competent to function
in a multitude of labors and work environments. </span></p>

<p>I believe one of the most significant matters among all the considerations of the latter days is the
role played by the prophet of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>One of my greatest blessings as a convert to the Church has been to receive by the power of the
Holy Ghost the certain knowledge that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God. Since my
conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1962, there have been nearly
eight million converts to the Church. I submit that they, along with me, have rejoiced in the new
knowledge we have gained about our friend and hero who was raised up to teach all of us about
the glory and power of the Great Plan of Salvation.</p>
<p>I testify to you that one of the reasons the restored gospel is so plain, so precious, so comforting
is that the convert comes out of a basic environment of confusion and false teachings regarding
the most fundamental doctrines within the churches and philosophies of men. Without the events
God set in motion through Joseph Smith, there would be no true plan of God in operation on the
earth and no way nor means under heaven for men to work out their salvation. The Atonement of
Jesus Christ along with God&#8217;s gift of eternal life to mankind were stopped from reaching the
very creatures intended to be affected without the conduit opened through the Prophet Joseph.</p>
<p>What God revealed from the heavens through the events of the Restoration is, in the words of
President Gordon B. Hinckley this past April, <i>&#8220;&#8230;[a] tremendous outpouring of knowledge and
authority from God upon the head of His Prophet&#8221;</i> (<i>General Conference Report, 
		</i>April 2005). In
raising up the Prophet Joseph Smith, God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son of God proved to
the world that a universal apostasy had fallen upon the earth between the days of Jesus and
Joseph and that the power of the Restoration was indeed of supreme importance in the history of
the world.</p>
<p>What I would like to do this afternoon is draw upon the testimonies of five adult men who were
converts. These men later became presidents of the Church or members of the First Presidency
and were personally acquainted with the Prophet Joseph Smith. They were true to him and his
mission from the onset of their conversion to the restored gospel. I will share with you the
testimonies of Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow and Heber C.
Kimball followed by my own testimony of this great prophet.</p>
<p>First the words and testimony of the prophet Brigham Young, born June 1801 and baptized April
14, 1832 at age 30 in Mendon, New York. He met Joseph in the fall of 1832, and said: 
		<i>&#8220;My joy
was full at the privilege of shaking the hand of the prophet of God.&#8221; </i>He stated later that he had:<i>
&#8220;The sure testimony, by the Spirit of Prophecy, that he was all that any man could believe him to
be, a true prophet&#8221;</i> (B.H. Roberts, Comprehensive History, Vol.1). And he stated:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I feel like shouting Hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph
Smith, the Prophet whom the Lord raised up and ordained, and to whom he gave
keys and power to build up the Kingdom of God on earth and sustain it. These
keys are committed to this people, and we have power to continue the work that
Joseph commenced, until everything is prepared for the coming of the Son of
Man. This is the business of the Latter-day Saints </i>(Brigham Young in <i>Journal of
Discourses</i>, 3:51).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Who can justly say aught against Joseph Smith?&#8221;</i> President Brigham Young said<i>.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I was as well acquainted with him, as any man. I do not believe that his father
and mother knew him any better than I did. I do not think that a man lives on the
earth that knew him any better than I did; and I am bold to say that, Jesus Christ
excepted, no better man ever lived or does live upon this earth. I am his witness
		</i>(Brigham Young in <i>Journal of Discourses</i> 9:332).</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the testimony of another convert, an adult man. John Taylor, born 1 November
1808, baptized 9 May 1836 at age 27 in Toronto, Canada. His statements about the Prophet are
powerful. He knew him intimately. He was with him when he died. He said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Joseph Smith&#8217;s mission was to restore this . . . gospel in its fulness. He brought
back the same Gospel that Jesus taught, the same faith and repentance, the same
baptism for the remission of sins, and the same laying on of hands for the gift of
the Holy Ghost, and the same Holy Ghost with all its powers and blessings. This
is the doctrine and these [are] the principles we profess to believe in. The Gospel
that we preach is the everlasting gospel; it reaches back into the eternities that
are past; it exists in time and it stretches forward into the eternities to come, and
everything connected with it is eternal</i> (John Taylor in Journal of Discourses
13:17-19). </p>
<p>Quite a statement in testimony of what the Prophet has done. </p>
<p>Then President Taylor says this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who was Joseph Smith? The Book of Mormon tells us he was of the seed of
Joseph that was sold into Egypt, and hence he was selected as Abraham was to
fulfil a work upon the earth. God chose this young man. He was ignorant of
letters as the world has it, but the most profoundly learned and intelligent man
that I ever met in my life, and I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles,
been on different continents and mingled among all classes and creeds of people,
yet I have never met a man so intelligent as he was. And where did he get his
intelligence from? Not from books; not from the logic or science or philosophy of
the day, but he obtained it through the revelation of God made known to him
through the medium of the everlasting gospel . . .</i> (John Taylor in <i>Journal of
Discourses</i> 21:163).</p>
<p>Elder John Taylor of the Twelve was a companion to the Prophet when his life was taken. In
Section 135, recounting the events of June 27, 1844 at the Carthage Jail in Illinois, Elder Taylor
said this: <i>&#8220;Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for
the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 135:3). John Taylor was a convert. He knew Joseph. What does his statement mean?
		<i>&#8220;He has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man
that ever lived in it.&#8221;</i> I would like to amplify that subject from the view of the convert&#8217;s
statements I will draw upon. </p>
<p>In the past 100 days I have fulfilled several reading and review assignments for the Priesthood,
Curriculum, and Family and Church History Departments. I have read and reviewed nearly 2000
pages of material for future publications of Priesthood and Relief Society manuals and volume
one of the <i>Joseph Smith Papers Project</i> along with several other books dedicated to the life and
teachings of Joseph Smith. It is obvious to me that Joseph taught as he was taught from on high.
As he received the doctrines of Christ through the Restoration of the eternal truths, he taught
with clarity and power the true gospel of salvation and eternal life. I know that Joseph was
tutored by the Master Teacher and the declaration by President John Taylor is indeed true.</p>
<p>Next, the testimony of another giant prophet of the Church, Wilford Woodruff, born March 1,
1807, and baptized December 31, 1833 at age 26 in Rustland, Oswego, New York. He saw
Joseph Smith for the first time in Kirtland, Ohio in April of 1834, just four months after his
baptism. From his discourses, President Woodruff gives this testimony of Joseph. 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It has been my faith and belief from the time that I was made acquainted with the
Gospel that no greater prophet than Joseph Smith ever lived on the face of the
earth save Jesus Christ. He was raised up to stand at the head of this great
dispensation &#8211; the greatest of all dispensations God has ever given to man. He
remarked on several occasions when conversing with his brethren: &#8216;brethren, you
do not know me, you do not know who I am&#8217;</i> (Wilford Woodruff in <i>Journal of
Discourses</i> 21:317).</p>
<p>And further:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This is the key, the foundation stone of all revelation. Joseph Smith was full of
revelation. He could translate anything given to him of God. He could receive
revelation without the Urim and Thummim. Many of the principle revelations
contained in the Doctrine and Covenants were received without the use of the
Urim and Thummim. They were given to him by the inspiration of Almighty God</i>
(MS 53:642, 1891). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I look upon Joseph Smith as the greatest prophet that ever breathed the breath of
life, excepting Jesus Christ. Father Adam, as I have said, stands at the head; but
Joseph Smith was reserved to lay the foundation of this great kingdom and
dispensation of salvation to the whole human family in these last days, to build up
Zion, to establish God&#8217;s Kingdom, and to prepare it for the coming of the Son of
Man. He held those keys. . . .</i> (Discourses of Wilford Woodruff 38:389, March 3,
1889).</p>
<p>Now just one statement from the prophet, Lorenzo Snow. He was born on April 3, 1814, and was
baptized on June 19, 1836 at age 22 in Kirtland, Ohio. He visited the Prophet and family, dined
with them, held private interviews with him. <i>&#8220;He was an honorable man, a moral man, and he
had the respect of those who were acquainted with him. The Lord has shown me most clearly
and completely that he was a Prophet of God. . . .&#8221;</i> (&#8220;Church History in the Fulness of Times&#8221;,
CES Religion 341-43 Manual, pg. 451). President Snow was another convert who came along in
the era of Kirtland and the apostasy and the great difficulties of the Church but could not be
swayed from his belief that the Lord had raised up the Prophet Joseph Smith. </p>
<p>And finally from among these witnesses, Heber C. Kimball, born on June 14, 1801, baptized on
April 16, 1832, two years after the Church was organized,at age 30, again in Mendon, New
York, similar to Brigham Young. From the life of Heber C. Kimball, we read the following
account, which occurred on November 1, 1838 at Farr West, Missouri at the height of the Church
period of apostasy in its darkest moments. Some of the leading brethren of the Church and
families of these brethren had apostatized and were literally fighting against the Church and
Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>President Kimball states:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>William E. McLellin wanted to know where Heber C. Kimball was. Someone
pointed me out to him as I was sitting on the ground. He came up to me and said:
&#8216;Brother Heber, what do you think of the fallen prophet now? Has he not led you
blindfolded long enough? Look and see yourself, poor, your family stripped and
robbed, and your brethren in the same fix; are you satisfied with Joseph?&#8217; I
replied, &#8216;Yes, I am more satisfied with him a hundred-fold than ever I was before,
for I see you in the very position that he foretold you would be in; a Judas to
betray your brethren, if you did not forsake your adultery, fornication, lying and
abominations. Where are you? What are you about? You, and Hinkle, and scores
of others; have you not betrayed Joseph and his brethren into the hands of the
mob, as Judas did Jesus? Yes, verily, you have; I tell you Mormonism is true, and
Joseph is a true prophet of the living god; and you with all others that turn
therefrom will be damned and go to hell, and Judas will rule over you</i> (<i>Life of
Heber C. Kimball</i>, p. 218).</p>
<p>Those five stalwart men were true to their faith, true to Christ and true to Joseph. Joseph became
the seer through which we find God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost. Joseph brought us the works
and words that enable us to see salvation. Jesus and Joseph, we can hardly talk of one without
the other. If Jesus is the great prototype of salvation, then Joseph is the great prototype of
revelation to men in the last days. Jesus tutored Joseph and Joseph taught of Jesus. This I know
with a certainty born of faith and confirmed time and time again over my years as a convert to
the Lord&#8217;s true Church. </p>
<p>Some of us came to the conversion process with custom designed doctrinal baggage and the
necessity to shed blinders and halters and chains of darkness keeping us from the truth. Indeed,
the truth shall make you free. It has made me free. It has allowed me to become, in the words of
Jesus, &#8220;a true worshiper&#8221; because of the Prophet Joseph Smith. </p>
<p>I served mass in the Catholic Church virtually every Sunday, from the age of nine to the age of
twenty-one. In this experience, my religious experience, I was taught that any prophet that comes
forth in modern times would be a false prophet. When I talk about doctrinal baggage, that was a
problem for me. From day one, Joseph Smith could not be a prophet for me because I had been
taught prophets in the latter days would be false prophets. With that kind of beginning, and then
to be introduced to Joseph, how does one break through that barrier of doctrinal baggage and
other baggage &#8211; and come to the knowledge of the truth? </p>
<p>Part of my doctrinal baggage was a belief system that declared a God incomprehensible to
understand by definition and by logic. I had to work through that with the help of the true
doctrines of Christ revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I was introduced to the idea of a
Restoration of the gospel through Latter-day Saint friends at Washington State University. My
wife today and other young people were my first contacts with the teachings of the Prophet
Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>At the age of 21, a returned missionary seminary teacher invited me to attend the first early
morning seminary class taught in the state of Washington. It was in Pullman, Washington where
I was a senior at Washington State University and was taught by a young man named John
Madsen. Brother Madsen was a fellow university student, yet he invited me to come to his class
with the young high school students and learn about seminary. I thought that was a curious thing:
seminary was where I would have gone to become a Catholic priest. What were these Mormon
youth doing in seminary?</p>
<p>During the first few weeks into the course on Church History; who was the major character in
Church History? You can&#8217;t go a day without learning about Joseph Smith. Some six weeks into
the course, Brother Madsen played a tape that most of you have probably never heard. It was
called &#8220;Profile of a Prophet&#8221; by Hugh B. Brown, a former member of the First Presidency of the
Church. It was a Friday morning, and in that setting, I still remember the words &#8220;under girding
and over arching&#8221; his testimony as they came into my soul about this prophet, Joseph Smith. I
received a powerful witness that morning that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith was truly the latter-day prototype of &#8220;asking God.&#8221; When we ask the right
questions, what can be the answers? I was yet to learn many glorious things. I had said thousands
of prayers in my life, but I had not yet learned to pray. </p>
<p>I testify to you that many years ago after one year of investigation of this Church, none of my
experiences of past years have been any more powerful, more revealing, more convincing than
on a special Friday morning 42 years ago. After going back to my little apartment following the
seminary class, having heard the words of President Brown concerning the &#8220;Profile of the
Prophet&#8221;, after having been invited to read selected passages from the Book of Mormon; I was
prepared to ask God in sincere prayer &#8220;if these things are not true&#8221;. As invited to do so by the
prophet Moroni in Moroni 10:4-5, I asked with real intent, having faith in Christ that he would
reveal it unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost. I desired to know the truth of all things. I
asked the right questions, finally. Is Jesus the head of this Church? Is Joseph His prophet? Are
there living prophets on the earth today and in this Church? Is this the true Church and should I
join? Is the Book of Mormon indeed the word of God? What must I do? </p>
<p>As Moroni promised to the readers of the book, &#8220;by the power of the Holy Ghost, you may know
the truth of all things.&#8221; In that moment of humble prayer, standing reverently and humbly in my
little room in my apartment, from the top of my head to the soles of my feet there was burned out
of my being every doubt, every concern, every worry, every question that I had about joining the
Church. I was still a Catholic, I had never met a missionary, thus what does one do? I sought out
those who taught that the Restoration of the gospel had occurred in these latter-days through the
Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>Coming to know the Prophet Joseph Smith was the key to my conversion, along with reading the
Book of Mormon, the keystone of our religion. I learned then, as I have continued to learn in
these years as a convert, that Joseph Smith&#8217;s remarks about the Book of Mormon are true. 
		<i>&#8220;A
man can get nearer to God by abiding by the precepts of this book than by any other book&#8221;</i>
(Book of Mormon, Introduction, paragraph 6). I know that to be true, and that is my personal
experience. I have been able to shed the doctrinal baggage that I learned as a youth and I now
have been able to understand what God has revealed from the heavens. Through His prophets,
through His Christ, through His records, I know these things are true. As I have learned the
doctrine of Christ in the plain and precious teachings of the Book of Mormon, I have drawn
nearer to God and I know that He lives and He has helped me walk the paths of life. 
		</p>
<p>I bear you my witness, Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration. I understand better now
than ever before the words of John Taylor when he spoke of Joseph <i>&#8220;doing more for the
salvation of men in this world, save Jesus only, than any other man who ever lived in it.&#8221;</i> I know
that this is true because the work of God for the living and the dead was restored. I understand
more now about the power of the calling of Joseph Smith. I say again, Jesus tutored Joseph and
Joseph taught of Jesus.</p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Brothers and sisters, I consider it a great privilege to be among you today. You hold the
promise of the very best of our future. I remember sitting in your seat more than a few years
ago thinking I was just one of thousands. Could I really make a difference? Indeed, each of
you can, and far more than you expect. You have a bright, exciting, yet challenging future
before you. What the next couple of decades hold for you may not be clear, but we are
blessed with a knowledge of our ultimate potential.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Earlier this year I had the opportunity to participate in a sport that I suspect few, if any of
you, have tried. Perhaps that is because you have more wisdom than I. The sport is skeleton,
an Olympic event. In skeleton, you lie down on a sled on your stomach and go head first
down the bobsled track with your face about 2 inches from the ice. As a first timer, you go
about 60 miles an hour while pulling several G&#8217;s in many of the turns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The first time I went, I felt mixed emotions: fear and terror. In reality it was a mix between
exhilaration and survival. Within a few seconds, I had accelerated to almost 60 miles an
hour, wondering if I had made a wise decision. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I had received some coaching in advance wherein I was told that since I was totally
inexperienced, I should just act like a sack of potatoes and not move, look straight down at
the ice in front of my face and hold on. As I rocketed down the track following this advice,
I found myself banging into the sides of every turn on the way down &#8211; a very rough ride
indeed. The end of the ride would never come quickly enough.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After gliding past the finish line, I emerged from the track facing the eager question from
a track employee, who also is a skeleton Olympian from Turkey, who asked, &#8220;How did you
like it?&#8221; I quickly described what happened and asked for more coaching. He then told me
to lift my head enough to look down the track and when I entered a turn, I should turn my
head that direction, which would slightly shift my weight, putting me on a better line.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I took the next run, I looked down the track to see where I was going and prepare for the
upcoming corners. The feeling was very different: somewhat more intimidating to see how
fast I was going, but with a greater sense of controlling my destiny. I quickly accelerated and
approached the first corner. As I approached the left turn, I turned my head left and
&#8220;swoosh!&#8221; I went cleanly through the corner. Beautiful! The only downside was that I went
even faster. I approached the next corner, turned my head and &#8220;swoosh!&#8221; another clean
corner. I was enjoying a great, clean run, until turn 14, which I took too high and ended up
dropping down &#8220;bam&#8221; into the side of the track before crossing the finish line, much more
thrilled with my run. It was truly an exhilarating experience. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I gained far more appreciation for the Olympians who take thousands of runs looking for
every one-thousandth of a second that can make the difference between gold and silver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I reflect upon my three runs down the skeleton, it provides insight into a broader view
on our mortal experience. Many times we are looking at what is immediately in front of us
on a day to day basis, just like looking straight down at the ice. We may fail to look up, to
&#8220;look down the track,&#8221; to have a longer view of where we are going. We can have a &#8220;cleaner
run&#8221; through life, avoiding many of the bumps, bruises and pitfalls of not staying on track.
We should strive to keep an eternal perspective in mind as we move through life&#8217;s varied
experiences. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember back to my days in college, where I could barely think a few days ahead due to
upcoming classes, papers and exams. I would look to the weekend for relief and perhaps
with the hope of someone who would actually go on a date with me. I generally failed in the
latter category, but that&#8217;s fine, because I ended up with the prize of the century with my dear
wife, Jennifer. Nevertheless, we can easily get distracted with all the commotion about us
and get pulled into the day-to-day enticements of the world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But we need to have a longer view of where we are headed &#8211; we need to &#8220;look down the
track&#8221;&#8211;because it will have an impact on what we do today. If we keep in mind our ultimate
divine destiny, we will likely take steps that are more consistent with who we really are. We
at times may fail to fully appreciate the magnitude of our divine potential or divine
opportunity. We have the promise of the wonderful potential for eternal life through the
atonement of the Savior and through our adherence to the principles of the plan of salvation.
An eternal family; eternal increase with eternal joy can be ours. We have this promise before
us. Also before us is the challenge of the gauntlet of the world through which we must pass,
all while keeping our focus on our ultimate destiny. As we run this gauntlet, we should ask
ourselves, &#8220;Who is our constant companion?&#8221; Is it the world, or is it the Spirit? The answer
to the question can, in large part, determine our ultimate destiny.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The world in which we live today is one foretold millennia ago by the ancient prophets and
reaffirmed through their counterparts today. The battle lines are drawn and we are engaged
in a war for the souls of mankind. We are witnessing the world ripen in iniquity as was
prophesied would occur in the last days. We can readily witness the rapid escalation of
deteriorating standards. It almost seems like it is changing on a daily basis and that it is
accelerating. Decades ago, President David O. McKay said, &#8220;Satan is still determined to
have his way, and his emissaries have power given them today as they have not had
throughout the centuries.&#8221; Do you understand the magnitude of that statement? And this
statement was decades ago. Satan&#8217;s emissaries have power as they have not had throughout
the centuries. You can see how that power has translated into where the world is today. 
		</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let us turn to the scriptures to see the descriptors of these last days &#8211; some of these
references are becoming more familiar as they are becoming cited more frequently.
Beginning with 2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy, Chapter 3, verse 1:<i> &#8220;This know also, that in the last days
perilous times shall come.&#8221; </i>Note the phrase, &#8220;last days.&#8221; 
		<i>&#8220;For men shall be lovers of their
own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
unholy.&#8221; </i>Are not these becoming more and more pervasive in society? <i>&#8220;Without natural
affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good.
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.&#8221;</i> Did Paul not see
precisely our day? What accurate descriptors! <i>&#8220;Having a form of godliness, but denying the
power thereof: from such turn away&#8230;Ever learning and never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth&#8221;</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 3:1-7). What was viewed in ancient days as severe
forms of wickedness has become commonplace today &#8211; and broadcast into virtually every
corner of the world and our homes. Who is your constant companion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now let us turn to 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi 28: 20-21. 
		<i>&#8220;For behold, at that day shall he </i>[Satan] <i>rage in the
hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.&#8221; 
		</i>Do we
not see an escalation in this phenomenon? If we stand up for traditional family values, we
may be accused of being discriminatory or intolerant &#8211; when, in fact, we are standing up for
divine, eternal truths. This is a stunning reversal of what were once widely-held values, to
being not only cast aside by many, buy in some cases ridiculed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Nephi now continues with a warning voice more directed to members of the Church: 
		<i>&#8220;And
others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well
in Zion; yea Zion prospereth, all is well &#8211; and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth
them away carefully down to hell.&#8221;</i> Satan gives us the message that everything is OK, we
are doing well enough, we have too much to do to worry about the necessity of daily
scripture study, that going to Church on Sunday is good enough. Maybe we aren&#8217;t doing
everything we should be doing, but we shouldn&#8217;t worry about it. Being passive in our
spiritual pursuits is a victory for the adversary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While we have the tremendous comfort in the knowledge of knowing that the Savior and
those with Him will be the ultimate victors, this is also a battle fought one soul at a time,
including for each of ours. It is not enough to take a casual approach to our divine destiny
that all will be OK. We each need to keep in mind an eternal perspective of what is occurring
around us and what we are doing to be engaged in the battle for righteousness, including our
own personal righteousness. The adversary would have us be casual about our relationship
with divinity and see it weakened over time to the point that we become more vulnerable to
his advances and temptations. Who is your constant companion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How is it that someone brought up in a righteous family, in the strong influences of the
Church, and perhaps served a mission, testifying countless times of the divinity of the work,
would eventually fall away? The world intrudes upon us almost incessantly, if we let it. We
can have the constant &#8220;buzz&#8221; of various media around us, telling us that the world is &#8220;OK,&#8221;
while the Spirit has almost no chance to fight through. If we become casual in our
relationship with deity, the road is paved for the adversary to slip in. It could very well be
that the world, in fact, becomes our constant companion. When does the Spirit have the
opportunity to break through? Or even if it does, it may become overwhelmed by the
constant bombardment of other influences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I would like to take you back a few years to the time of the Olympics in Salt Lake City. We
had spent over two years of incredible efforts trying to get everything ready, in spite of a
troubled history. The summer before the Games were to be held, we were finally beginning
to feel somewhat confident that we would do well. However, just five months before the
Opening Ceremonies were to be held, 9/11 was thrust upon all of us &#8211; an unimaginable
tragedy. I clearly remember that morning, sitting at our headquarters speaking with Mitt
Romney on the phone, who was just then driving by the Pentagon as it was enveloped in
smoke, thinking &#8220;how are we going to host the world in just five months and keep them
safe?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We then embarked on a full review of our security planning and although we found it to be
quite solid, we saw areas that needed enhancements. The law enforcement agencies and
members of the Secret Service, FBI, military and FEMA were great partners and became
good friends. One area of strength was protecting the athletes, thinking back to the tragedy
of Munich &#8211; making sure we did everything to ensure their safety. The most vulnerable time
for the athletes is when they are been transported to and from the venues. We put in place
something called AVLs, or Automated Vehicle Locators, into each athlete transportation
vehicle. These AVLs were GPS-based wherein the location of each vehicle was continuously
communicated to security headquarters. In addition, each vehicle&#8217;s specific route was
programmed into our database such that if it went off course by more than 50 feet, alarms
would go off at security headquarters. We had Secret Service stationed throughout the
Olympic theatre, who could respond quickly to any emergency.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A few days before the Games began, athletes arrived to settle into the Olympic Village and
to practice at the venues. During this period, the AVLs were active and one morning, the
alarms went off. A bus for a hockey team was off course. We called the driver on the radio
and then the cell phone. No response. Could we have trouble already, even before the Games
began? The Secret Service was scrambled to the location of the bus and found it empty &#8211; in
a McDonald&#8217;s parking lot. They ended up joining the driver, safe and sound, for breakfast
at McDonald&#8217;s. Tragedy averted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we go off course a little, do the alarms go off for us? Do we have the Spirit with us
to warn us? Do we listen to the Light of Christ, or our conscience? Do we recognize when
we are heading a little off course and quickly change directions to the straight and narrow
path? If we begin to ignore the alarms or if we don&#8217;t hear them anymore, we should put our
heads up, &#8220;look down the track&#8221; and recognize where we are headed, especially when we
think things are somewhat OK; yet we may, in fact, be off course. The easiest way off course
is just a little at a time, when it is barely noticeable. This is a key part of the message of &#8220;All
is well in Zion.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The easy, natural path is to follow the way of the world and all it holds. Such is the behavior
of the &#8220;natural man.&#8221; President McKay said, &#8220;Sin thrusts itself upon you. It walks beside
you, it tempts you, it entices, it allures. You do not have to put forth effort. Evil seeks you,
and it requires effort and fortitude to combat it.&#8221; On the other hand, &#8220;all good things require
effort. That which is worth having will cost you part of your physical being, your intellectual
power and your soul power&#8230;But you have to seek, you have to knock&#8230;truth and wisdom
are gained only by seeking, by prayer, and by effort.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As we lift our sights from the ice, so to speak, and &#8220;look down the track&#8221; to see where we
are headed, the nature of our divine destiny, we gain an eternal perspective. We understand
that it takes sincere effort, focus and preparing a plan to not only withstand the pressures of
the world, but to advance spiritually to one day realize the seeds of divinity within us.
President McKay continues, &#8220;The gospel gives us a chance to live above this world and its
temptations, and, through self-control and self-mastery, to live in the Spirit, and that is the
real life here and after.&#8221; This is what we seek &#8211; the Spirit in to become a true, day-to-day
constant companion. Who is your constant companion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, how do we go about this? First, we take a step back from our lives and assess how we
are doing. What daily effort do we exert to gain the Spirit in our lives? How do we push back
from the world? We are given the simple, yet incredibly powerful basics, &#8220;search, ponder
and pray.&#8221; Allow me to suggest the following: we can begin immediately to enjoy a &#8220;daily
devotional,&#8221; wherein we take time to sup from the word of God, ponder the things of our
lives and then approach Him in earnest prayer. It then becomes far more natural to DO the
will of the Lord as we go about our daily lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As part of this daily devotional, we have been challenged by our prophet to read the Book
of Mormon by the end of the year. Have we each accepted that challenge? It is not too late
to begin. If you started when the challenge was issued, just four pages a day will do it. These
four pages can build a stronger spiritual connection to the Lord that is essential to move
forward spiritually. President Hinckley said, &#8220;There will come into your lives and into your
homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in
obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son
of God&#8221; (<i>Ensign</i>, August 2005). What great promises! The Book of Mormon is a tremendous
gift of divine clarity from the Lord and should be one of our most prized possessions, and
greatest friends we have here on earth. Its clear message of the divinity and saving power
of the Lord give us spiritual strength. King Benjamin recognized the power of sacred
scripture in daily living, when, in teaching his sons, he declared the following in Mosiah
chapter 1, verse 5:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept
and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his
mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our
fathers would have dwindled in unbelief.</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I appreciate that phrase, 
		<i>&#8220;have his commandments always before our eyes.&#8221;</i> We should live
likewise and the prophet has suggested one way to do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Building on this study, we can take quiet time to ourselves. President Hinckley elucidated, 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>We live in a world of rush and go, of running here and there and in every
direction. We are very busy people. We have so much to do. We need to get
off by ourselves spiritually&#8230;Get by yourself and think of things of the Lord,
of things of the Spirit&#8230;Think of the things of God. Just meditate and reflect
for an hour about yourself and your relationship to your Heavenly Father
and your Redeemer. It will do something for you</i> (Gordon B. Hinckley,
Brigham City Utah Regional Conference, Feb. 22, 1997).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am convinced that one of the weapons of the adversary is distraction from that which is
most important. In addition, much of what comes into our lives pulls us down, in some cases
in a very subtle way, and in other cases precipitously. Through the constant barrage of the
TV, the videos, the Bluetooth cell phones, the Ipods, the internet, the satellite radio, the CD
players, we receive a constant infiltration from the declining moral standards of the world
and can fall victim to its message. It does impact us. A recent book highlighted how the new
digital age is literally &#8220;rewiring our brains.&#8221; Let&#8217;s take a step and assess, who is our constant
companion? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When can the Spirit break through? How can the Spirit compete with this inundation? The
adversary does indeed have power unlike ever before. He has electronic tools and means to
sway us. We need to create time for the Spirit to break through; for the still, small voice to
speak to us and guide us. It is there. WE but have to knock and live worthy of it. Who is our
constant companion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If we have spent time in our daily devotional absorbing the word of God and contemplating
who we are and how we are doing, we can then effectively seek our Father in prayer, with
this prior preparation opening the opportunity for real communion with divinity, laying the
foundation for the Spirit to become our companion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we take the next step of doing His will, we keep our companion with us. It is surely
a blessing to have that added power in our lives. However, we still live in a busy, and
tempting world. One way to stay strong in the face of worldly challenges is to think of the
savior being right beside us and how we would act in this particular situation. Just visualize
that for a moment. The Savior walking beside us, observing the things we do and say. We
can utilize this approach in fighting temptation. It bears similarity to having the Spirit with
us, and to help guide and direct us. As the world continues its geometric progression into
declining moral values, we, in turn, need to be stronger to withstand what comes our way.
Being strong enough today may not be strong enough for tomorrow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Hurricane Katrina has had a devastating impact on hundreds of thousands of people. Of
particular note is the staggering impact it had on New Orleans. We have witnessed an entire
city partially submerged. As we all know, the city is below sea level and is protected by
levees. These levees were designed to withstand a Category 3 hurricane, taking the risk that
this would be strong enough. We then witnessed a raging Category 4 hurricane, which
overwhelmed the levees, resulting in unprecedented flooding in the area. The city was
simply unprepared for what hit them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It seems like we are in the midst of a hurricane of a different form &#8211; a raging storm of
increasing wickedness that would try and capture us in its grasp. The question for each of
us is how well are we prepared to stay on the Lord&#8217;s side? Our we strong enough for what
may eventually come our way?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We can strengthen ourselves. We can push back on the world. Once again, in the words of
President McKay, &#8220;Resist him (the adversary) and he becomes weaker and you become
stronger, until you can say, no matter what your surroundings may be, &#8216;Get thee behind me,
Satan.&#8217;&#8221; We arrive at a point &#8220;that our souls might bask in the light of the Holy Spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We then have the opportunity to enjoy the marvelous fruits of the Spirit, which are many.
First, we enjoy the knowledge that we are on the right path and receive the accompanying
peace of conscience. This leads to tasting the true happiness which the prophets describe in
the scriptures. In 1 Nephi 11, we read,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw? And I answered
him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the
hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all
things</i> (1 Nephi 11:21-22).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This is what is most joyous to the soul and what the Savior desires for each of us. His
mission, in the end, is to help us achieve eternal happiness. Second, we have the Spirit as our
guide in all aspects of our lives. Third, we receive gifts of the Spirit that may be different for
us of us, but some are common to all. One of the great gifts of the Spirit is that of charity,
as promised in Moroni, chapter 7. Fourth, it becomes a Comforter to us in times of need. 
		</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We will all face difficulties and challenges throughout life. Be prepared. It will happen. The
knowledge that what we are doing is right, combined with the power of the Comforter
greatly assists us to bear such burdens that will come our way. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In February of 2000, after I had spent one year fully engaged in trying to help turn things
around at the Olympics, our son, Michael, who was 18 at the time, was becoming ill. We
were told that it was the flu, and not to worry about it. He kept getting worse so finally we
took him to the emergency room. I vividly remember standing in one of those examination
rooms with my son and wife, hearing the words, &#8220;Your son has cancer.&#8221; I felt like I had been
run over by a truck. I began asking questions like, &#8220;Why me?&#8221; &#8220;Why our family?&#8221; &#8220;We have
been trying to keep the commandments, so how could this happen?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t understand. We
then turned to the Savior more than ever before. The Spirit became a more important part
of us. It is interesting how we wait until times of need to turn more to Him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It turned out that Michael had a tumor that filled most of his chest cavity, and in fact, had
collapsed one of his lungs. We began a journey with countless surgeries, chemotherapy,
radiation, all in a battle for survival. He lost weight, lost hair, had mouth sores, was
constantly sick and at one point was taking 22 pills a day. He got to the point where he
couldn&#8217;t walk up the stairs and we had to carry him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the midst of his treatments, he was invited to give his testimony at the farewell of his best
friend, whom he had helped reactivate. When he got up, Michael said something we had
never heard before. He said, &#8220;The day that I found out that I had cancer, when I went to say
my prayers that night, the only thing I could think to say was to thank my Heavenly Father
for this experience, because I knew it would make me a better person.&#8221; He understood at that
moment the divine plan. He could &#8220;look down the track&#8221; and have an eternal perspective.
Mike is doing reasonably well at this point, attending BYU and serving in the temple one
day a week. He knows he needs that extra blessing of the temple to keep a constant reminder
of having an eternal perspective. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The knowledge of an eternal perspective, combined with the Comforter, provided an entirely
different context to our experience. We emerged with a far better comprehension of
mortality and our complete reliance on things eternal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When you are focused on what is truly important, the world fades away. We turn to the
loving embrace of the Savior and enjoy the warmth of the Spirit. The atonement addresses
more than sins, it provides comfort in times of need. In Alma, chapter 7, verses 11 and 12,
we read, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every
kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon
him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which
bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels
may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according
to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Brothers and sisters, you have a divine destiny that awaits you. As we awaken to the full
impact of the turmoil that exists in the world today, we can see things differently. Take a
step back and take a real inventory of what you see around you. The world at large has many
elements that are very troubling and need to be recognized for what they are. However, the
Savior has given us many wonderful gifts to aid us in our return to Him. Fortunately, you
attend a great institution that will give you a great foundation. There are many wonderful
things around you here that will aid you. Please take advantage of the many resources that
are available to you and appreciate them. One of the greatest resources we have is the Book
of Mormon. Another is having the Sprit as your constant companion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let&#8217;s put our heads up and &#8220;look down the track&#8221; to see where we are headed. An eternal
perspective puts things in their proper priority. Let us heed the warnings when we get off
course, especially when the drift is subtle. Let us each have a daily devotional to keep that
eternal perspective we need, and to have the Spirit as our constant companion. With this
foundation, we can avoid the pitfalls of the world and be better prepared for the difficult
challenges when they come. Ultimately, we can then experience the eternal happiness the
Father and the Son have made available, all dependent upon us.</span></p>

</p>
<p>It is an honor for me to be here with you today. For over sixteen years now my life has been
greatly blessed by my associations with this great institution, its administration, its faculty, its
staff and above all its students. And it is my hope that this devotional address will be useful in
your daily lives, your daily struggles, your daily self-doubting, as other devotional addresses
have been in mine.</p>
<p>I wanted to base one of the themes of my address on the last piece of advice I gave to my sons as
they were leaving on their missions. I told them to always be cool. Always be cool. I told them
not to let self-doubt, guilt and insecurities get the best of them. We live in a very demanding
culture; a culture of high expectations; a culture of excellence. In most ways that is very good.
However, in a few ways it can be bad if we lose the proper perspective.</p>
<p>I have served in many capacities in the church. Right now I am serving as bishop of my ward in
the community, and throughout my life I have known many people who are overburdened, who
think they can never measure up, who are ridden with too much guilt, who are overly concerned
with image, who are struggling needlessly with culturally-created false needs and false problems.
They seem to be completely unaware of what Jesus said. In Matt. 11:28-30 we read the
following words:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i></p>
<p>There are a lot of people who don&#8217;t heed that advice. You see, one out of every three Americans
has a self-concept dominated by the negative. That means that they think more negative things
about themselves than positive things. We human beings can be so negative that it takes around
14 positive experiences to make up for the self-esteem damage inflicted by one similar negative
experience. For example, as I am leaving this devotional today, if I overhear one person say,
"Boy, I am glad that talk is over. That guy was really boring." If I hear something like that, I am
going to have to hear fourteen of you say, "Boy, I am sure glad I went to devotional today. That
was a great talk." I am going to have to hear fourteen of you say something like that before my
self-esteem is restored to where it was before I heard the negative comment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because we are so fragile, we are unwilling to accept challenges. And sometimes we
are even too fragile to deal with the normal frustrations of life. One of my professors in my
doctoral program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro was a man by the name of
William W. Purkey. He was one of the top educational psychologists in the United States.
During one of his lectures he made the following statement that I wrote down. He said, "Life is
not a spectator sport. Life is a contact sport. The worst thing that can happen to you is to walk off
the football field of life with a clean uniform." That&#8217;s what he said. Because if you walk off the
football field with a clean uniform on, it means you haven&#8217;t been playing the game. You haven&#8217;t
been taking the hits. You haven&#8217;t been learning what you need to learn and experiencing what
you need to experience. But often, we are too scared to play in the game of life, too scared to live
the life God would have us live, because our lives are filled with fear and, unfortunately, many
of those fears are taught to us by our surrounding culture.</p>
<p>I was born in Philadelphia and lived in that general area until my middle school years. My
parents divorced when I was very young and my father wasn&#8217;t able to come to visit very much.
As I grew up, I became a latch key kid who would get home many hours before my mother
arrived from her work as a secretary in downtown Philadelphia. I remember when it would get
close to the time for her to arrive, I would stare out the window of our second-story apartment,
hoping to get a glimpse of her walking home from the bus stop. You see, I was sure that
something was going to happen to my mother and that I would be left with no parents at all. My
fears that my mother would die were probably brought on by the culture I lived in and by what I
would see on T.V. and in the movies. There are probably many children today who have similar
fears and you can&#8217;t blame them.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s look at some of the movies: Snow White&#8217;s mother is dead, Cinderella&#8217;s
mother is dead, Belle in Beauty and the Beast, her mother is dead, the Beast&#8217;s mother is probably
dead too. Pocahontas&#8217; mother is dead, Bambi&#8217;s mother gets killed during the movie, the
Hunchback&#8217;s mother is dead, Aladdin&#8217;s mother is dead, Jasmine&#8217;s mother is dead, the Little
Mermaid, I&#8217;m not sure about her. Is her mother dead? Well, considering all that&#8217;s going on she is
probably dead too. What&#8217;s going on here? Somebody explain all this to me. The most hazardous
occupation in the world is to be the mother of a Disney character.</p>
<p>My life was filled with unreasonable fears. Some of us have many unreasonable fears. Yet, some
of our fears are legitimate:</p>
<p>If a loved one is seriously ill, that is a legitimate fear.</p>
<p>If someone you love is addicted to drugs or alcohol, that is a legitimate fear.</p>
<p>If you yourself are involved in destructive behaviors, that is a legitimate fear.</p>
<p>However, even our legitimate fears should not be as powerful and as vexing as they often are.
The Lord will always be there for us when we really need Him. He is helping many of you now
in ways you know not. We often forget that in the very famous 23<sup>rd</sup> Psalm it says 
		<i>"Yea, though I
walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me"</i> (Psalms 23: 4).</p>
<p>My unreasonable fears never materialized. My wonderful mother is still very much alive. She is
still very much my mother. She still gives me advice on how to properly dress. She doesn&#8217;t really
like the music I listen to. She doesn&#8217;t approve of the way I part my hair. She says that a professor
shouldn&#8217;t part his hair down the middle. And I tell her that many of the professors part their hair
down the middle. Their parts are usually quite wide, but they still part their hair down the
middle.</p>
<p>Most of you still have your mom, some of you, maybe through untimely death or other
circumstances, are separated for awhile. Sometimes tragedies really do happen. But I have a
strong testimony that when the unreasonable fears really do come true, that the day will come
when you will be reunited and all will be well. One day I was walking in a graveyard in N.C. and
saw several old graves where people had died before their time. Their deaths probably caused a
lot of deep anguish among family and friends. Many tears were probably shed. Inscribed on one
of the gravestones was a verse from the Book of Revelation, where we learn about a promise of
the Lord concerning what will happen in the winding up scene to those who live good lives yet
have suffered. It says in chapter 21 that the Lord <i>will wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain
		</i>(Revelation 21:4). And I believe in that promise. Despite the setbacks of life, we are on a journey
that leads to great joy.</p>
<p>When I got older I had other fears. I used to fear that the girls wouldn&#8217;t like me. Maybe because
they didn&#8217;t. I wasn&#8217;t popular with the girls back when I was a teenager. I used to wonder what I
could do to be popular with the girls and I decided to ask some people for advice. When I was a
teenager, I had two evil stepbrothers. And I decided to ask them for advice about girls. And they
gave me advice. But after I got their advice, I could tell that their advice maybe wasn&#8217;t the best.
That&#8217;s true, I had two evil stepbrothers. They shaped up later on in life. They were a lot older
than I was. They used to make me do all the chores around the house. One time I remember there
was this special dance and they wouldn&#8217;t let me go.</p>
<p>Well, after the failed attempt to get advice from my evil stepbrothers I asked another one of my
relatives for advice about girls. And this nice person, hoping to make me feel better, said, "If a
girl likes you, she ignores you." Now, I&#8217;m not sure that is right. If that was the case, then 100%
of the girls in my high school must have been crazy about me.</p>
<p>Some of you may be in the same predicament that I was in and are looking for answers. And I
believe the answer is basically that you are trying too hard when you should just be
concentrating on being friends with, associating with and dating people of high standards. You
don&#8217;t care if they are attracted to you or not. Just be your real self, don&#8217;t worry about impressing
them with your style and eventually, maybe one of those people you have gone out with will,
before you know it, turn out to be more than just a friend. But things need to develop naturally.
You should never try to make things move more quickly than they naturally should. Trying to
make things move too quickly, when real love is not there, can cause all kinds of problems,
emotionally and spiritually. There are too many students here whose self-esteems are continually
on the line with relationships with the opposite sex, they are continually preoccupied about it,
they are continually trying to force relationships that are not really there, and those students just
need to learn to be cool. The dating and romance scene is painful enough without making it
harder on yourself.</p>
<p>What I did is I eventually met this girl who very soon became my best friend. I married my best
friend. My wife and I met as she almost ran me over with her car. The first time she stared into
my eyes she saw a look of abject horror. You know, the disturbing thing about the whole episode
was that I was on the sidewalk at the time. I have often wondered why that occurred. I have
several theories as to why that happened. My first theory is a scientific theory that says that
when you are driving, if you see something you find attractive, you steer toward it. That is my
first theory as to why she almost ran me over. My second theory is a psychological theory.
Psychologists talk a lot about the subconscious mind, you see, and I believe that as she was
driving by me she thought subconsciously, "If I can&#8217;t have that man, no other woman will."
That&#8217;s my second theory as to why she almost ran me over.</p>
<p>So you see, I should not have worried so much. The Lord might have sent this girl to almost run
over me knowing that I would marry her. We are always fearful about things that probably
should not preoccupy us very much. We should never let these fears make our life miserable.
You see, sometimes the worry about things happening can be worse than if they actually happen.
If you try your best but never find a good companion, you might eventually realize that the panic
of never getting married was more miserable than not getting married itself. The scriptures say in
the book of Romans that "all things work together for good of those that love God." I have a
testimony that God is just and good people we will receive great blessings in this life or the next
and all will be made right. </p>
<p>It is good that life is difficult. That&#8217;s part of the program. But the Lord will be with us every step
of the way. In Psalms 121 we read, <i>"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh
my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth</i>" (Psalms 121:1-2).</p>
<p>You are a son or daughter or God. You don&#8217;t want things to be easy, you want them to be hard.</p>
<p>There is a line in the Disney movie "Cool Runnings" where the coach is talking about the painful
lesson he learned by being caught cheating in the Olympics. He said that he cheated because he
just had to be successful. He cheated because he just had to win. He said that, as a result, he
learned that if you were not good enough without it, you would never be good enough with it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things you should never have to have. Having to have things can make you
miserable.</p>
<p>If you have to have a 4.0 GPA, you need to be good enough without it.</p>
<p>If you have to be popular, you need to be good enough without it.</p>
<p>If you have to be good-looking, you need to be good enough without it.</p>
<p>If you have to have a lot of money, you need to be good enough without it.</p>
<p>If you have to have romance in your life right now, you need to be good enough without it.</p>
<p>You are a son or daughter of God. You can do without those things.</p>
<p>The famous Chinese philosopher Yang Chu once said: "There are four things which do not allow
people to rest: Long Life; Reputation; Rank; Riches. Those who have them, fear ghosts, fear
men, power, and punishment. They are always fugitives. Whether they are killed or live, they
regulate their lives by externals." We need to be always careful about regulating our lives by the
externals of our culture.</p>
<p>The Buddha once said, "Imagine that every person in the world is enlightened except you. They
are all your master teachers, each doing just the right things to help you learn perfect patience,
perfect wisdom, perfect compassion." This means that:</p>
<p>The people who make fun of you . . . they are your master teachers.</p>
<p>Impolite drivers and tailgaters . . .  they are your master teachers</p>
<p>Pushy telephone solicitors . . . they are your master teachers</p>
<p>A difficult family member, . . . he or she is your master teacher</p>
<p>Members of the opposite sex who pay no attention to you . . . they are your master teachers</p>
<p>And, unfortunately, . . . many of your roommates, . . . they are your master teachers.</p>
<p>And now I would like to make a special plea. It is time to start trying to get along a little better
with your roommates. The time that you are spending with them will be short and is sacred time.
You will never pass this way again. You have got to seize the day and make good, precious
memories rather than unpleasant ones. Something you should always remember is that there is an
ancient Chinese proverb that says, "A moment of patience can save a hundred days of sorrow."</p>
<p>You see, sometimes we think as long as we have a testimony, that is enough. We can be difficult
to get along with and we can hurt people occasionally, but as long as we have a testimony, we
think that&#8217;s enough. But that&#8217;s not enough. We erroneously think it&#8217;s okay, as long as we have a
testimony.</p>
<p>It would do us well to remember what is said in 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3. The apostle Paul says:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am
become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all
knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and
have not charity, I am nothing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to
be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</i></p>
<p>In a devotional last summer, the speaker quoted Elder Neil A. Maxwell as saying that developing
charity in our lives was probably more important for our salvation than baptism. That is a
powerful statement.</p>
<p>Like I just said, having a testimony is great, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the only thing. One of the most
dangerous things this church can produce is a jerk with a testimony.</p>
<p>Much of our probation here on the earth should be spent lifting people up. When Thomas Edison
completed work on the first light bulb, he carefully handed it to a young assistant to carry it up
the stairs. The assistant was so nervous about handling that precious invention that he let it slip
from his hands and it broke all over the floor. It took several days of work for Edison&#8217;s team to
produce another one. When the second light bulb was completed, Edison intentionally called the
same young assistant over and gave the bulb again to him. This time he did not drop it. This act
of kindness on Edison&#8217;s part must have had a positive influence on the young man&#8217;s life. Edison
knew that a person&#8217;s self-esteem is much more important than some inconvenience or some
material object.</p>
<p>Our relationships are precious. However, sometimes our own insecurities, poor self-concepts and
our recognition that we have sinned can get in the way of our precious relationships. These
insecurities and feelings that we don&#8217;t measure up spiritually can prevent us from becoming the
people we want to become and also the people that God wants us to become. There are a lot of
members of the church with "unworthiness complexes." They just give up trying to be a true
follower of Christ. This should never be because it seems like I learned somewhere that . . .</p>
<p><i>"Though your sins be as red as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow; though they be as
red as crimson, they shall be as wool" </i>(Isaiah 1:18).</p>
<p>It seems like I learned that somewhere.</p>
<p>It seems like I heard somewhere the words, <i>"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:
not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid"</i>
(John 14:27).</p>
<p>It seems like I heard that somewhere.</p>
<p>It seems like I read somewhere, that the Lord said, <i>"For the mountains shall depart and the hills
be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace
be removed, saith the Lord"</i> (Isaiah 54:10).</p>
<p>It seems like I read that somewhere.</p>
<p>But for illogical reasons we think that all of this applies to others and not to us. We forget that
the Lord says in the Doctrine and Covenants that what he says to one he says to all. And we all
are part of the all.</p>
<p>Truman Madsen once said that church needs to be a safe place. Church is where one should not
have to worry about being belittled. Church is a place where young people should not have to
concern themselves with being made fun of because of the brands of clothes they wear or what
type of scripture covers they have. And BYU-Idaho is an extension of church. </p>
<p>We need to do everything we can to make BYU-Idaho a safe place for all of God&#8217;s children who
come here. Sometimes we need to stop making people feel that they don&#8217;t measure up due to
unreasonable expectations that are not basic to the gospel and have nothing really to do with the
rules and high standards of this great institution. We need to make sure we build people up and
not give out subtle put downs. We need to make sure that, at all times, as President Clark has
said, we are on the outside rather than the inside of the Great and Spacious Building. We need to
make sure we preserve the precious Spirit of Ricks that is an integral part of the heritage of this
great place.</p>
<p>Back in November of 2003, I was attending a professional conference in Philadelphia. Between
sessions, I took a walk to revisit some of the places I knew from my childhood. During my walk,
I was surprised to witness the completion of the Philadelphia Marathon that was being held that
day. I was drawn to the final mile or so of the marathon route where I witnessed thousands and
thousands of spectators lined up on both sides of the street loudly cheering every runner that
went by. It takes a long time to finish up a marathon. From the time the first place runner finishes
to the time the last place runner comes in can be many hours. I spent a little more than an hour
observing what was going on during that final mile or so. During that time, I saw thousands of
people festively cheering as every runner struggled down the last few blocks gasping for breath.
Every runner was made to feel that he or she was a hero, a man or woman of worth,
accomplishment, and value. And I am sure that hardly anybody knew anybody. They just
cheered unconditionally.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that we worry too much about questions concerning others that 
		<i>no one should
worry about at all, </i>or at the very worst, should only be addressed by their good bishop, stake
president or in other sacred situations. You see, as the runners in the marathon were passing by,
nobody in the cheering crowd asked if they were worthy enough to be appreciated.</p>
<p>Nobody asked if on their missions they were Assistants to the President.</p>
<p>Nobody inquired if they came from a large family or a small one.</p>
<p>Nobody asked if they bought their clothes at <i>The Gap </i>or at <i>D. I.</i></p>
<p>Nobody worried if they came from an active family or an inactive one.</p>
<p>Nobody asked if they got their Eagle or their Young Woman&#8217;s Medallion.</p>
<p>Nobody posed any questions concerning the political affiliations of their parents.</p>
<p>Nobody inquired if they could have gotten into BYU-Provo or what their ACT was.</p>
<p>Nobody asked if they had been in the popular group in high school.</p>
<p>Nobody asked. . . . Yet the cheering went on and on.</p>
<p>Those people were celebrated for one simple reason. They were celebrated because they are our
fellow human beings, our brothers and sisters here on this earth. Like the rest of us, they
struggle, they worry, they do good deeds and bad ones. They ponder, plead and pray. And right
then as they were finishing the marathon, right then they were successful in at least one thing, at
least one very difficult endeavor. At least one success in the midst of their many failures and
insecurities. At least one. That&#8217;s why they were celebrated. Remember, His yoke is easy and His
burden is light. And we need to see that and go, and do likewise. And this is my prayer in Jesus&#8217;
name, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">Inaugural Response</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho</p>
<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">President Kim B. Clark</p>
<p>President Hinckley, to you, and President Monson, President Faust, and all the members of the
Board of Trustees, to Elder Kerr, to the past presidents of this school who are here today, to
President Summers, to our many honored guests, the wonderful students of BYU-Idaho, my
colleagues and friends and family, my brothers and sisters, I extend my welcome, my gratitude
and my love on this special day. </p>
<p>It is an honor and privilege to stand before you to respond to the charge given to me by President
Hinckley. I would like to share with you for a few moments what is in my heart and what I
believe it means to be the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho at this time in its
history.</p>
<p>As I look back on what has brought us here this day, I am conscious of a legacy and heritage that
comes in two parts. The first is my family. I am grateful beyond words for Sue, my eternal
companion, the love of my life, who has blessed my life for 35 years. I am grateful for seven
wonderful children and for their families. They teach, inspire, and support me; and I love them. 
		</p>
<p>The legacy of family is a great source of inspiration to me. Sue&#8217;s father, Charles Hunt, passed
away four years ago. But her mother is here today, and I salute her for her faith and kindness and
the example she is to us. I hope that my mom and dad who both have passed away will know of
this day and of my gratitude and love for them. They sacrificed and invested so much and passed
on to me many things, but one of special importance today is a love of learning and teaching. I
come from a long line of teachers on both sides of my family, and I cherish that heritage.</p>
<p>The second part of the legacy is the history of this school. Beginning as a frontier academy in
1888 and continuing under inspired leaders for over 100 years, Ricks College established a
legacy of faith, and sacrifice, and righteousness. This is a very special place, a place that the
Lord has preserved and dedicated to be the home of a great university with a special and
distinctive culture. There is on this campus a spirit of love and support for each individual
student. There is a consecration of time and talent by the people who work here that blesses the
lives of those students. In the midst of that love and that consecration, the Holy Ghost ministers
on this campus. The Spirit of Ricks is real.</p>
<p>Now, under the direction of the Prophet and the Board we have become Brigham Young
University-Idaho. In the initial stage of that transition and under the overall guidance of the
Board, Elder Eyring as Commissioner of Church Education and Elder Bednar as the president of
BYU-Idaho laid down important guiding principles and powerful ideas about education in this
university. As I pondered these ideas and principles in light of the challenge we now face, a
scripture whose power I felt as an 18-year-old freshman at Harvard College came to mind. It is
found in Luke chapter 6 verses 47-48. This is the Savior speaking:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew
you to whom he is like:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation
on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,
and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</i></p>
<p>We, too, must dig deep. We have been given powerful principles and an inspired framework; but
we must dig deep and sink those principles into the bedrock of testimony, and faith, and
consecration. </p>
<p>As I look forward to the future, my starting point is the mission of this university. We have a
wonderful, inspired mission to build testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ; to
educate our students with high quality; to prepare them for the responsibilities they will face; and
to create here a wholesome, righteous community in which students may thrive spiritually,
intellectually, and socially.</p>
<p>I like to summarize our mission with two words. The first is disciple. Our mission, our very
purpose, is to educate, develop, and prepare disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. This purpose is
deeply rooted in this university. In a way that I have found remarkable, this is a student-centered
university. It is that way by divine appointment. The Lord watches over this university in a direct
and powerful way. He is mindful of the individual students who come here. Our purpose is to
help them become His true followers, His true disciples, a light to the world.</p>
<p>The second word is leader. When I use that word I have in mind leadership with a small &#8216;l.&#8217; This
is the kind of leadership we need in every part of every kind of organization in our society. We
want our students to provide the kind of leadership that serves, and inspires&#8212;first and foremost
in their families and in the Church, in their communities, and in their work. Listen to the words
that Elder Eyring spoke four years ago about our students:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. They will
have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more of what money
can buy. Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become&#8212;and this is a prophesy that
I am prepared to make and make solemnly&#8212;those graduates of BYU-Idaho will
become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add
value wherever they serve</i> (Elder Henry B. Eyring, <i>A Steady, Upward Course</i>,
Brigham Young University-Idaho Devotional, September 18, 2001).</p>
<p>That is our mission. As we pursue that mission in the years ahead, I believe there are three great
imperatives before us, three great things the Lord would have us do. 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">The first is that we must
raise substantially the quality of every aspect of the experience our students have</span>. As good
as it is today (and believe me, it is very, very good), every dimension of the BYU-Idaho
experience&#8212;spiritual, intellectual, social&#8212;must increase in its quality. We must do all of this to
better prepare our students for a very challenging world. This will require inspired innovation
and important changes in many aspects of our work. Let me give you one example of what I see
ahead.</p>
<p>The example is learning by faith. The Lord has commanded us to <i>&#8220;. . . seek learning, even by
study and also by faith&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:118). President Harold B. Lee said this
about learning by faith:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Let no one think that &#8220;learning by faith&#8221; contemplates an easy or lazy way to
gain knowledge and ripen it into wisdom.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . learning by faith requires the bending of the whole soul through worthy living
to become attuned to the Holy Spirit of the Lord, the calling up from the depths of
one&#8217;s own mental searching, and the linking of our own efforts to receive the true
witness of the Spirit</i> (Harold B. Lee, <i>The Iron Rod</i>, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, June 1971, p. 5)</p>
<p>Faith is at the heart of almost every line in that statement. It is in the &#8220;bending&#8221; of the soul in
righteous obedience; it is in the diligent searching, in the &#8220;calling up,&#8221; and in the &#8220;linking&#8221; of
personal effort to the Spirit. In all this there is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, faith in the power of
His Atonement, faith in the ministry of the Holy Spirit, as the Savior said, to<i> &#8220;. . . teach you all
things, and bring all things to your remembrance . . .&#8221; </i>(John&#160;14:26). That faith moves the
student to action: to obey, to bend, to search, to call up, to link. That is learning by faith.</p>
<p>Now, there is a great spirit of learning on this campus and much learning by faith. Our challenge
is to take that spirit deeper, to make learning by faith a pervasive, everyday reality. This will
require much of our students. But it also will require much of the faculty and staff. Indeed, it will
require new ways of learning and teaching based on inspired scholarship.</p>
<p>This university has a wonderful faculty. They are teachers of skill, passion, and commitment. We
have a loyal and dedicated staff, people of talent and goodness. They do great work today. The
challenge before us is to create even more powerful and effective learning experiences in which
students learn by faith. This requires, but is more than, teaching by the Spirit. To learn by faith,
students need opportunities to take action. Some of those opportunities will come in a stronger,
even more effective Activities program where students lead and teach one another and
participate broadly. Some of them will come in the classroom, where prepared students,
exercising faith, step out beyond the light they already possess, to speak, to contribute, and to
teach one another. It is precisely in that moment of faith that President Lee&#8217;s &#8220;calling up&#8221; and
&#8220;linking&#8221; of personal effort to the Spirit occurs. It is in that moment that the Spirit teaches. 
		</p>
<p>To create that kind of classroom, with that kind of learning, will require more than new methods
and approaches to teaching. It will require new learning experiences based on the creative
development of new materials and new courses. I see ahead a great season of creativity and
innovation, a season of powerful new ideas and new curricula all across this campus. I see
inquiry and scholarship that is blessed with inspiration because it is done by faculty whose hearts
are right, whose eyes are single to the glory of God, and who desire nothing in their work but to
bless the lives of their students.</p>
<p>The second great imperative is to <span style="font-weight: bold">make a BYU-Idaho education available to many more of
the young people of the Church</span>. But this must be accomplished within the resources that the
Board already has given us. We have begun this process with the three-track admission system.
Because we learn and teach on this campus year-round, we serve many more students than the
11,600 or so who are on the campus at any one time. But we must continue to search for creative
ways to organize, schedule, and calendar the educational experiences of our students so that
more of them may come.</p>
<p>As we do so, I am convinced that we will find new ways to use information technology to reach
more students and to deepen the learning experience of those we touch. In a day not far from
now, we will be able to break down the barriers of time and space and connect our students on
internships or between semesters to the university and to each other and create outstanding,
interactive educational experiences. In these experiences students will teach one another in new
and powerful ways. This capacity to educate effectively across time and space will allow us to
leverage the capacity of the university and reach many more young people.</p>
<p>Imperative number three<span style="font-weight: bold">: we must lower the relative cost of education</span>. BYU-Idaho is already
a remarkably efficient school. We have taken to heart and learned well the lessons of the
pioneers: modest, disciplined, doing more with less, taking good care of what we have, willing to
consecrate what we have, and trust in the Lord. In the years ahead we must continue to put our
culture and those pioneer lessons to good use. Even as we seek to increase quality and serve
more students, we must pursue new ways to be more productive. We will not get there just by
squeezing the organization, nor will we get there by cutting corners. Our path is one of
consecration and deeper knowledge of the processes of learning and teaching. With that depth
and that consecration will come new ways of learning and teaching that will yield a higher
quality experience while requiring relatively fewer resources per student.</p>
<p>There is great power on that path&#8212;power to weather adversity, power to extend the resources of
the Church, and power to realize the mission of the university more effectively. But I believe
there is something more at stake even than this.</p>
<p>When I think of this third imperative, I see little girls and boys sitting in Primary classes in this
country and, indeed, all over the world. These children will make and keep sacred covenants
with the Lord. I believe the Lord desires to bless them and, like the army of Helaman, raise them
up as a righteous generation of disciple-leaders all across the earth. That will take
education&#8212;higher education of the kind we have talked about today. Now, I realize that most of
these young people will never come to BYU-Idaho. But they will be blessed by what we learn
here about learning by faith and delivering a high-quality education at relatively low cost.</p>
<p>That blessing will come in different ways. It may come through educational activities and
programs initiated by the Church&#8212;in wards and branches, in stakes, and in seminaries and
institutes. That blessing also may come to the young people of the Church, and to young people
not of our faith, through universities outside the Church that take what we do here and apply it to
their educational programs.</p>
<p>I believe that at BYU-Idaho we must learn to use new technologies and develop methods,
materials, programs, and concepts that not only can be applied to our students on and off our
campus, but also can be effectively and efficiently applied by others across the Church and,
indeed, across the world. I am convinced that this university is in this valley where our pioneer
heritage is deeply ingrained, where the people are humble and faithful, so that we can be a
proving ground of great fidelity for education that will bless the young people of the Church
worldwide.</p>
<p>As we reflect on these three wonderful imperatives, you might imagine that to do them all&#8212;to
raise quality, to serve more students, and to lower relative costs&#8212;would be extremely difficult, if
not impossible. Indeed, it is traditional and even natural to see in these three imperatives only
dichotomies and trade-offs&#8212;higher quality but only with higher, not lower costs; serve more
students, but only by raising costs, or reducing quality. But we are not bound by tradition, nor
are we limited to our own understanding or to the wisdom of men. In short, this is a very unusual
university.</p>
<p>Seven and a half years ago, Elder David Bednar stood where I am standing today and likened
Ricks College to the ship that the great prophet Nephi built under the direction of the Lord. Elder
Bednar noted that this was a ship of &#8220;curious workmanship&#8221; that was &#8220;not built after the manner
of men,&#8221; and was, when complete, &#8220;exceedingly fine&#8221; (see 1&#160;Nephi 18:14). He then said these
words about Ricks College:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>May I suggest that Nephi's experience in building that ship is a model for us at
Ricks College as we prepare for and move into the next century. We, too, must
build something we have never built before in order to go someplace we have
never been before</i> (President David A. Bednar, <i>Inaugural Response</i>, February&#160;27,
1998).</p>
<p>How prophetic those words would be. The ship of curious workmanship that was Ricks College
is now BYU-Idaho. It is a great ship. And we are going places we have never been before.
Indeed, we are going places no one has ever been before.</p>
<p>As I look forward to the work before us, I take great comfort in another item of &#8220;curious
workmanship&#8221; that was vital to the success of Nephi&#8217;s journey: the Liahona. Here is how Nephi
described the Liahona:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . as my father arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great
astonishment he beheld upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship;
and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one
pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And . . . they did work according to the faith and diligence and heed which we did
give unto them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read,
which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord</i> (1 Nephi 16:10,
28-29).</p>
<p>With the ship that was like no other and with the advanced technology of the Liahona, Nephi
made his journey and went exactly where the Lord wanted him to go. And so will we. To meet
all three imperatives will require deep knowledge about learning and teaching and much greater
understanding of the development of disciple-leaders. We will need new technologies,
innovative ideas, new concepts, and inspired scholarship of &#8220;curious workmanship.&#8221; And we
will have them! I doubt they will appear on our doorstep one bright morning. But I know they
will come. They will come because of the faith and devotion and the unity of heart and mind in
this university. They will come because of the love the Lord has for the precious young people
who come here and those who will learn from what we do here. They will come as we move
forward on the appointed course the Lord has set. When we have done all that we can with what
we have, they will come. Of that I have no doubt.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to share with you a passage of scripture that has come to have a
special place in my heart. I believe it has great meaning for BYU-Idaho. The passage begins in
the third verse of section 97 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am well
pleased that there should be a school in Zion . . . .</i></p>
<p>This is an inspiring verse. But as I read this passage on a recent morning, my eyes moved down
the page, and I came to verses 8 and 9: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Verily I say unto you, all among them 
		</i>[everyone associated with the school] <i>who
know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are
willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice&#8212;yea, every sacrifice which I, the
Lord, shall command&#8212;they are accepted of me. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is
planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit.</i></p>
<p>As I read those verses, the strong impression came to me: this describes the Spirit of Ricks; this
is BYU-Idaho. This is a school full of people united in their commitment to the Lord, striving to
do His will, humble and teachable, willing to consecrate of their time and their talents in His
work. And I believe that the promise in verse 9 is our promise: We have been &#8220;planted in a
goodly land, by a pure stream . . . [and we shall bring forth] much precious fruit.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Hinckley, it is in the spirit of these verses in the Doctrine and Covenants that I
accept&#8212;no, I embrace&#8211;the charge you have given me. And I pledge to you and the Board and to
my colleagues, to our students, to the alumni, to all who love this school, that I will live my life
to be inspired to lead this university in a way worthy of your trust. I am committed to pursue the
mission of BYU-Idaho with every bit of energy and ability the Lord has given me. I know that
with all of us working as one, with the inspired guidance of the Board, this university will move
forward on the steady, upward course the Lord has set. It will be Brigham Young University-Idaho, a university true to its heritage, true to its mission, everything the Lord wants it to be. 
		</p>
<p>I leave you my testimony that God, our Father in Heaven, lives; that Jesus of Nazareth is the
Christ, the promised Messiah. He is the Redeemer and Savior of the world. I know that my
Redeemer lives. His Church has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. BYU-Idaho is
an important part of the Restoration and of the great unfolding work of the Lord in our day. In
that work, in this Church, Gordon B. Hinckley stands today where the Prophet Joseph stood. He
is the prophet of the Lord and leads the Lord&#8217;s church on the earth. Of this I testify, in the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Inaugural Luncheon</p>
<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Elder David A. Bednar</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Brothers and sisters, Sister Bednar and I are delighted to be here on this occasion.  I fully expected
to attend the inauguration of the new president, but not in the role which I am fulfilling today.  For
seven and a half years this campus was our world.  The responsibility to which I was called one year
ago now makes the world our campus.  But I must tell you that as I am in Lima or Arequipa or
Jakarta, I see your faces and I think of you often.  We love you, and we miss you, and you are now
and will always be a part of who we are. We have fond memories of our time here at Ricks
College/BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the few moments that I speak with you, I want to pay tribute to Sister Susan Clark.  Today is the
day when her husband is featured and lauded in many ways, and appropriately so.  In a very
dignified way she stands at his side as an equal partner, but the spotlight will not be focused upon
her today, which I am sure is just fine with Sister Clark.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Let me share just a couple of things I have learned and observed about Sister Clark.  First is her
inherent sense of compassion.  As I have talked to people who have known the Clarks for a long
time, the very first thing that comes to everyone&#8217;s lips as they describe Sister Clark is how
instinctively and immediately compassionate she is.  Her nickname in Boston, among those who
know her well, is &#8220;Saint Sue.&#8221;  And what they describe about her is the fact that she responds so
quickly and so effectively to the needs of other people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second thing I think is important to recognize about Sister Clark is her consistency.  With Sister
Clark, what you see is what you get.  She is not a different person in a formal setting like this one
today than she is at home.  She might dress differently for the occasion, but she is the same person.
That consistency is the essence of integrity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now, I know something about the wives of the men who have served as the presidents of this
institution.  I believe that many men in the various eras could have fulfilled the presidential
responsibilities.  But each of the women who have served with their husbands brought a remarkable
tone and a sense of love to this campus that could have been achieved in no other way.  I said
frequently during the time that I served as president, and I say again today, that many men could
have done what I did.  However, I do not know of any other woman who could have done what
Sister Susan Bednar did.  And that same thing is true about Sister Wilkes, Sister Bennion, Sister
Eyring, Sister Christensen, and all those who have served as the first lady of this institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">So, rightly and appropriately today, we feature President Kim Clark.  But he would not be here if
it were not for Sister Susan Clark and what she, as his eternal companion and partner, has helped
him to become.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now as I conclude, I repeat a comment I have made before.  I hope you will remember this
statement.  The creation of BYU-Idaho is one of the most important educational events of the
restoration.  The lessons that are being learned and will be learned on this campus will influence
members and non-members the world over.  The innovations that are initiated on this campus will
bless the students and the faculty who attend here and, over time, will have an impact in many areas
of the world.  I know that the Lord Jesus Christ is aware of, attentive to, and involved in the things
that are taking place on this campus.  I so testify and express my love to you, in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Ammon Fife</p>
<p>President Clark, on behalf of all of the students, I welcome you to Brigham Young University-Idaho. In the short time you&#8217;ve already been here, we have grown to love you and your wife,
Sister Clark.</p>
<p>We marvel at your great accomplishments in life; we recognize your even greater spiritual
preparations; we are excited to have you here at our school.</p>
<p>We are excited for changes that lie ahead. We do not fear change. We do not fear doing things
we have never done before. We do not fear following those whom God&#8217;s prophets have chosen
to lead us.</p>
<p>Your role to us is more than that of an administrator. We look to you and Sister Clark as
teachers, exemplars, and at times, almost like parents. We will follow your lead, we will do what
you ask us to do, and we won&#8217;t complain. We will, and do, pray that God will smile upon you,
and bless you with revelation and strength as you lead this university. In the name of Jesus
Christ, amen</p>

http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/MiscellaneousAddresses/2005_10_11_Hinckley.htm
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Inauguration</p>
<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">President Gordon B. Hinckley</p>
<p>What a great message we had from President Clark. What an inspirational thing. What a great
leader we have. And how thankful I am that he has come here to lead this great and unique
institution. Governor Kempthorne, President Summers, thank you very much for your regards
and for all who have spoken. And now, in conclusion, a few words.</p>
<p>Pardon me first for telling a personal experience. Three or four days ago I was presented with a
treasured volume that came from somewhere, I do not know where. It is the old textbook that I
used 75 years ago when I was one of four students who studied Greek at the University of Utah. 
		</p>
<p>I have long since lost my ability to read Greek and also Latin which I took at that time. But in the
course of my studies I had the opportunity of reading the New Testament in the original Greek
and gained from that a great insight of love and appreciation for my Savior and the great and
glorious things which He taught. I gained a love also for those who think and say things. I gained
even a reverence for the wisdom of great and inspired thinkers.</p>
<p>My love for the wisdom that comes of teaching and learning stems from the mandate given this
people through divine revelation. Said the Lord: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another&#8230;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed
more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all
things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to
understand;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have
been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are
at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations,
and the judgments which are on the land; and also a knowledge of countries and
of kingdoms</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 88:77-79).</p>
<p>I know of no other religious body which has in its doctrine any such statement.</p>
<p>Education is a part of our religion. The Lord has further said: <i>&#8220;The glory of God is intelligence&#8221;
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 93:36), and <i>&#8220;whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this
life, it will rise with us in the resurrection&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18). Knowledge,
understanding, education, these are all eternal things. What a glorious and wonderful concept
this is. </p>
<p>Now, I do not think that my Latin or my Greek have any eternal significance. But some of the
elements that came with that study do have eternal significance. There are principles and
concepts and statements of values which are everlasting in their nature.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that this Church spends millions of its resources on educating its young
people. Our annual budget for education is the largest single budget we have in the Church, with
the exception of expenditures for building and maintaining houses of worship as we grow and
advance across the world. </p>
<p>We maintain BYU&#63512;Idaho, BYU&#63512;Provo, BYU&#63512;Hawaii and LDS Business College with a
combined student body of approximately 45,000 full-time students. I wish we could maintain
more. These are not only first-class institutions for the teaching of secular subjects. A
fundamental and basic part of all of their curriculum is the teaching of values, of moral
responsibility, of spiritual truth, of faith. They have demonstrated, as I think no other institutions
in America have demonstrated, that a first-class secular education can be taught in company with
a strong and solid teaching of values and spiritual truth and knowledge.</p>
<p>Where we cannot maintain universities, we have a program of religious institutes with facilities
near the campuses of almost every major educational institution in America. We have one such
at Harvard.</p>
<p>Dr. Clark, I understand that one of your special interests is the teaching of a management
concept called modularity. I quote now: &#8220;Modularity is an efficient way to build a complex
design from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together as a
whole.&#8221; </p>
<p>To my unknowing mind, I suppose that means various components are assembled into an
operating efficient whole. Reduced to working terms, I suppose that means that one part of an
automobile might be produced in Japan, another in Mexico, another in Canada, and another in
the United States. Then all are brought together to constitute a beautiful and efficient automobile. 
		</p>
<p>If that concept is correct, or if my understanding of it is correct, then might I suggest that on this
campus you have the great opportunity and the great challenge of melding together in to a
wonderful and interesting whole a tremendous variety of young people who come from all across
America and from some foreign lands, bringing them all together in a great body of scholars who
will learn together and assist one another and will work with each other to bring about vast good
in the world in which they will live. This sick old world so needs people of integrity, people of
principle, people of high ideals, and people of great talent and faith to strengthen and mold
society in a far better way than it is now being molded. </p>
<p>As we look at our society there are so many problems we face. The family is falling apart.
Infidelity and divorce are rampant. So many children are born to single mothers. A writer in the
Wall Street Journal recently stated that the percentage of live births to single women was a mere
4% in the early 1950s. In 2003, it reached 35%, and a dramatic 68% among blacks (Wall Street
Journal, &#8220;The Hallmark of the Underclass,&#8221; by Charles Murray, Sep 29, 2005). 
		</p>
<p>Every child who comes into the world is entitled to a married and loving father and mother.
Every family needs a nurturing father. Every family needs the strength and stability of a decent,
good, God-fearing man. </p>
<p>Alcohol and drugs are destroying the lives of millions. What a remarkable thing it is that you can
walk about this campus and not pick up a beer can, or a hypodermic needle, or find a student
addicted to binge drinking or the use of methamphetamines.</p>
<p>A recent issue of Newsweek carried a long article saying that methamphetamine is America&#8217;s
most dangerous drug. It tells the story of a woman named Kimberly Fields. She and her husband
bought a house in a leafy Chicago suburb. Before long they were parents, with two sons, a black
Labrador and a Volvo in the drive. But somewhere along the way this blond mother with a
college degree and a $100,000-a-year job found something that came to matter more:
methamphetamine. </p>
<p>Kimberly tried drug rehab but failed. She couldn&#8217;t care for her children. Her husband divorced
her. She was arrested three times for shoplifting&#63512;most recently, police say, for allegedly stealing
over-the-counter cold pills containing pseudoephedrine, the key ingredient used in making meth
(Newsweek, Aug 8, 2005, p. 41).</p>
<p>What a tragedy, what a terrible tragedy. And such tragedies can be found all over this land.</p>
<p>I think it unlikely that those who leave this campus, imbued with what is taught here, will ever
stumble into so dreadful an abyss.</p>
<p>Dr. Clark, we welcome you most warmly. We are so richly blessed to have you presiding over
this institution. You are a man of great learning. You are an individual with a demonstrated
humanitarian spirit. You are recognized for your abilities across the world. Now you have been
kind enough to come here, to build this university.</p>
<p>We are trying an experiment here. We think this school is different from any other university in
America. Some of its features, of course, are the same, but many are unique.</p>
<p>We did away with intercollegiate football, and there was something of a howl that went up. But
instead of a relatively few involved in intercollegiate sports, the whole student body is in
intramural sports, and having a wonderful time. They are involved with the arts, with music, with
other such activities on a very large scale. </p>
<p>The internship system is unique. Companies invite our students to serve as interns, because they
can have them all through the year instead of during the summer only. The track system allowing
for three entry points during the academic year, and requirements for computer learning are
handled in an unusual way.</p>
<p>What a remarkable thing it is that the faculty have given up all rank. Where else will you find
such a phenomenon on a large university campus?</p>
<p>Along side this campus we are constructing a beautiful new stake center, a house of instruction
and worship, where these students may grow in a knowledge of the things of God, where they
may gain knowledge of the Redeemer of the world, the Lord Jesus Christ. And there will soon be
a magnificent temple rising to the south of us with a statue of an angel of the Lord on its
crowning steeple. Here the students will be taught things of eternity. Those who fall in love on
this campus will be married not until death do ye part, but for all eternity.</p>
<p>I submit that this campus, with its adjoining buildings, may literally offer a foretaste of heaven
with the imparting of knowledge, both secular and spiritual, with the encouragement of unselfish
service, with the teaching of values that are everlasting in their consequence, and with faith in
the Living God. I pray that it may be so, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Governor Dirk Kempthorne</p>
<p>President Hinckley, distinguished guests, President Clark and Sister Clark and your beautiful
family, welcome to Idaho.  And President Hinckley, thank you for the invitation to participate in 
this very historic occasion.  On behalf of the people of the great state of Idaho, I wish to thank
you, to thank the Church, the Board of Trustees, all of the faculty and staff and some of the finest
students in the world who have made BYU-Idaho one of the true gems of the Gem State. 
		</p>
<p>President Clark, you and your family will now call one of the most beautiful corners of the world
home.  Idaho is a dynamic and growing state and no community exemplifies that more than
Rexburg.  Recently I was in Salt Lake City where the President of the United States was
speaking.  I was asked to join him there and then ride back to Idaho with him on Air Force One. 
As we flew to Idaho, I was discussing with the President things that were happening in the great
state of Idaho.  Even before I could mention it, the President said, &#8220;And you even have the dean
of the Harvard business college moving to Idaho.&#8221; President Clark, your acceptance of this call
to lead this great university is significant, and people have taken notice.</p>
<p>As governor of the state of Idaho I am excited to have your leadership here.  In your experience
at Harvard you helped train and educate students who are destined to become the leaders of
business and financial institutions throughout the world. I&#8217;m confident that you commitment to
the highest quality education will continue here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>The students who study here will be able to compete with anyone in the world, but in this
environment you will also have the opportunity to train and educate the leaders of perhaps the
most important institution in society: the family.  Certainly for our economy to grow and for our
children to have jobs we need bright educated leaders in the business world.  As governor I will
also tell you that as a society, we need families with high morals and values, who will preserve
our quality of life and citizens who would treat their neighbors with greater kindness and respect. 
Your students will leave here better educated and they will also be better human beings.
President Clark, in this beautiful corner of the world called Rexburg, Idaho, you&#8217;ll have the
opportunity to send forth leaders to this world who will make a difference in their communities
by making a difference in their own homes.  God bless you in this important endeavor.</p>
<p>Idahoans are rightfully proud of this great state and all of the significant events that occur here. 
This visit today by President Hinckley at the Inauguration of President Clark, a world renowned
educator and businessman, an event marked by dignitaries from throughout the education and
business world including the president of Harvard University, Larry Summers, is another
significant event that makes all of us extremely proud.  God bless us on this very special day.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Inauguration</p>
<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Elder W. Rolfe Kerr</p>
<p>It is an honor for me to extend my own greetings and commendation to President Kim B. Clark
and his wonderful wife, Sue. Much has been made of their coming to BYU-Idaho from Harvard.
Many have wondered why; many others know why. In the minds of President and Sister Clark
there has been no question. They have a faith and a spiritual sensitivity which have directed their
lives through the years, and this is no exception. From the time this opportunity arose, the Spirit
was guiding them. When the phone call came they were prepared.</p>
<p>President Clark is uniquely qualified to lead this institution. He has quickly become aware of the
unique educational mission and model of the university. It has been a perfect fit for his
entrepreneurial interests and creative spirit. We who knew something of him and of his abilities
knew it would be. The future of BYU-Idaho is bright, and uniquely so, under the capable
leadership of President and Sister Clark.</p>
<p>In President Clark&#8217;s first address to the faculty and staff, he captured what may be the essence of
leadership. He said, paraphrased in part, &#8220;There are no unimportant positions and no unimportant
people in this institution. Every person and every position will contribute to what ultimately
happens to the student in the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>It now becomes President Clark&#8217;s role to facilitate the success of each of his BYU-Idaho
colleagues in making their individual contributions to every student who enrolls in this
university. I pledge my own support in this most worthy effort. I welcome you, President and
Sister Clark, to this very special university and to the exciting times which lie ahead for you and
for the entire university community. I pray for Heaven&#8217;s blessings to be upon you, upon this
institution, and upon all who serve and will be served here. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Inauguration</p>
<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">President Lawrence H. Summers</p>
<p>President Hinckley, members of the BYU-Idaho community, honored guests and friends: I have
had the good fortune to know Kim Clark since our days together as graduate students some thirty
years ago. And so I join you today not only as someone pleased to bring good wishes from the
large and diverse family of American colleges and universities, and from President Clark&#8217;s alma
mater and longtime professional home. I join you as someone who has admired this
extraordinary person, and learned from him, and valued his wisdom and friendship, for most of
my life. My own good fortune, and Harvard&#8217;s, is now all of yours. As the months and years pass,
you will know more and more what I mean.</p>
<p>Kim served with remarkable distinction for the past decade as Dean of Harvard Business School.
With him, the school conceived of itself less as a school about business per se than as a school
devoted to the art and craft of leadership. And in him, the school found not only an exponent of
strong, principled, creative, and humane leadership, but its embodiment. Now that we face the
daunting task of seeking Kim&#8217;s successor at Harvard, and as I solicit advice from the many
people who have benefitted from his service, I hear time and time again their hopes for a leader
with a strikingly familiar set of characteristics: </p>
<p>Someone who models integrity in all that he, or she, says and does. 
		</p>
<p>Someone with a strong moral core and a deep sense of values. </p>
<p>Someone with a passion for education and a reverence for its power to change people&#8217;s lives.
Someone who prizes not only intelligence but imagination.</p>
<p>Someone who sees higher education not just as a means of professional development but as a
singular opportunity for personal growth &#8211; and for cultivating an ethic of service to the
community, the nation, and the world.</p>
<p>Someone who brings people together in a spirit of common purpose &#8211; who lifts their sights and
helps them to achieve even more than they might have dreamed.</p>
<p>Someone who inspires each of us, in our own way, to be not only good but great &#8211; and not only
great but good.</p>
<p>Someone like Kim Clark.</p>
<p>Now, that someone is here with you. Bittersweet news for Harvard &#8211; but wonderful news for
your university, and for all who care about American higher education and the character of those
who lead its institutions. In the classrooms and corridors of Harvard Business School, which I&#8217;m
afraid to say are not jargon-free, it is often said that a certain organization stands at an &#8220;inflection
point&#8221; &#8211; a special moment of opportunity and potential transformation. From all I have heard and
read about BYU-Idaho, this proud institution stands at such a moment in its history. You could
ask for no better leader and partner in charting your future together.</p>
<p>In speaking of the school he led so ably, he often captured its mission in a simple yet powerful
phrase: to educate leaders who make a difference in the world. In Kim Clark, you will enjoy all
the blessings of such a leader. Each of you, and all of you together, will have a superb guide in
finding new and exciting ways to make a difference in the world. May he, and all of you, look
forward to a great adventure. Congratulations, Kim and Sue; congratulations, members of the
BYU-Idaho community; and many thanks to everyone here for the privilege of joining you
today.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Inauguration</p>
<p style="text-align: center">October 11, 2005</p>
<p style="text-align: center">David L. Ward</p>
<p>Dearest President Hinckley, beloved brethren of the First Presidency, members 
		of the Quorum of
the Twelve and Board of Trustees, esteemed Faculty, Staff, Students, and Honored Guests: as
president of the Faculty Association, I feel privileged to act as voice for the faculty of Brigham
Young University-Idaho in welcoming President Clark and his wife, Sue, to this university.  This
truly is a day to celebrate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been over five years since President Hinckley personally announced that Ricks College was
to become Brigham Young University-Idaho.  Even so, the newness of that proclamation, and
the spiritual confirmation felt as we heard it declared by a prophet&#8217;s voice, has grown more
vibrant while deepening in significance with the passing of time.  Now with the advent of a new
president, President Kim B. Clark, the spirit of this prophetic vision encourages and inspires us
all the more.</p>
<p>Since President Hinckley&#8217;s announcement in June of 2000, this campus community has enjoyed
the able leadership of President and Sister Bednar, and President and Sister Wilkes.  During the
time of their tenure we experienced impressive growth promoted by a vision of what this college
could become through personal consecration and sacrifice, born of a living faith in Christ.  Now
we look beyond the present in the hope of enjoying a spirit of inspired innovation through the
leadership of President Clark as we deepen our commitment to all that is good and right and
possible at this university.</p>
<p>President Clark, may the Savior&#8217;s atoning power expand our minds and bind our hearts and 
individual gifts and talents to yours in an effort to realize a vision for this university that is God&#8217;s
own, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is sincerely a privilege for me to be on the BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho campus this afternoon. I must admit
that it is somewhat uncomfortable for me to address this student body in a devotional setting. For
many years this institution has had the reputation of maintaining the highest standards for not
only speakers to deliver a devotional talk but also for the students to receive the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Former President David A. Bednar shared a devotional on the BYU campus four years ago.
During the opening hymn, I noticed that an unusually high number of students were dressed in
Church clothes for this devotional. My recollection is that President Bednar talked briefly about
the tradition of devotionals at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho. He then requested those students in the audience who
had their scriptures to hold them up. It seemed like a third of those in attendance were holding
scriptures high in the air with a broad smile on their faces. These students also were those who
were appropriately dressed for the devotional. They were obviously former students of your
institution and had been taught how to receive a devotional message. At that moment I was
beginning to understand the high standards expected at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho devotionals.</p>
<p>Now you can understand why I feel more than a bit intimidated by this experience. It&#8217;s only
because of the message that I have selected, one in which I have great faith, that gives me
confidence to share a few thoughts with you today. My talk is entitled, &#8220;Personal
Revelation&#8212;An Expression of God&#8217;s Love for His Children.&#8221; We are children of a loving
Heavenly Father who wants us to find joy in this life and return to Him for eternity.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated: &#8220;God is the one sure source of truth. He is the fount of
all inspiration . . . We are His children. Out of the love He bears for us, He will guide us if we
will seek, listen, and obey&#8221; (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, p.555).</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories that illustrates God&#8217;s love for His children is told by President Hugh
B. Brown, former counselor in the First Presidency. President Brown begins:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I was living up in Canada. I had purchased a farm. It was run-down. I went out
one morning and saw a currant bush. It had grown up over six feet high. It was
going all to wood. There were no blossoms and no currants. I was raised on a
fruit farm in Salt Lake before we went to Canada, and I knew what ought to
happen to that currant bush. So I got some pruning shears and went after it, and I
cut it down, and pruned it, and clipped it back until there was nothing left but a
little clump of stumps. It was just coming daylight, and I thought I saw on top of
each of these little stumps what appeared to be a tear, and I thought the currant
bush was crying . . . I looked at it, and smiled, and said, &#8220;What are you crying
about?&#8221; You know, I thought I heard that currant bush talk. And I thought I heard
it say this: &#8220;How could you do this to me? I was making such wonderful growth. I
was almost as big as the shade tree and the fruit tree that are inside the fence,
and now you have cut me down. Every plant in the garden will look down on me,
because I didn&#8217;t make what I should have made. How could you do this to me? I
thought you were the gardener here.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I thought I heard the currant
bush say, and I thought it so much that I answered . . . &#8220;Look, little currant bush,
I am the gardener here, and I know what I want you to be. I didn&#8217;t intend you to
be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to be a currant bush, and some day,
little currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, &#8216;Thank
you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to cut me down, for caring enough
about me to hurt me. Thank you, Mr. Gardener.&#8217;&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . Years passed, and I found myself in England. I was in command of a cavalry
unit in the Canadian Army. I had made rather rapid progress as far as
promotions are concerned, and I held the rank of field officer in the British
Canadian Army. And I was proud of my position. And there was an opportunity
for me to become a general. I had taken all the examinations. I had the seniority.
There was just one man between me and that which for ten years I had hoped to
get, the office of general in the British Army . . . </i>[When]<i> this one man became a
casualty . . . I received a telegram from London. It said: &#8220;Be in my office
tomorrow morning at 10:00,&#8221; signed by General Turner in charge of all
Canadian forces. I called in my valet, my personal servant. I told him to polish my
buttons, to brush my hat and my boots, and to make me look like a general
because that is what I was going to be. He did the best he could with what he had
to work on, and I went up to London. I walked smartly into the office of the
General, and I saluted him smartly, and he gave me the same kind of a salute a
senior officer usually gives&#8212;a sort of &#8220;Get out of the way, worm!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sit
down, Brown.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I cannot make the appointment. You are
entitled to it. You have passed all the examinations. You have the seniority.
You&#8217;ve been a good officer, but I can&#8217;t make the appointment. You are to return
to Canada and become a training officer and a transport officer. Someone else
will be made a general.&#8221; That for which I had been hoping and praying for ten
years suddenly slipped out of my fingers.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then he went into the other room to answer the telephone, and I took a soldier&#8217;s
privilege of looking on his desk. I saw my personal history sheet. Right across the
bottom of it in bold, block-type letters was written, &#8220;THIS MAN IS A MORMON.&#8221;
We were not very well liked in those days. When I saw that, I knew why I had not
been appointed. I already held the highest rank of any Mormon in the British
Army. He came back and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s all, Brown.&#8221; I saluted him again, but not
quite as smartly. I saluted out of duty and went out. I got on the train and started
back to my town, 120 miles away, with a broken heart, with bitterness in my soul.
And every click of the wheels on the rails seemed to say, &#8220;You are a failure. You
will be called a coward when you get home. You raised all those Mormon boys to
join the army, then you sneak off home.&#8221; I knew what I was going to get, and
when I got to my tent, I was so bitter that I threw my cap and my saddle brown
belt on the cot. I clinched my fists and I shook them at heaven. I said, &#8220;How could
you do this to me, God? I have done everything I could do to measure up. There is
nothing that I could have done&#8212;that I should have done&#8212;that I haven&#8217;t done.
How could you do this to me?&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And then I heard a voice, and I recognized the tone of this voice. It was my own
voice, and the voice said, &#8220;I am the gardener here. I know what I want you to
do.&#8221; The bitterness went out of my soul, and I fell on my knees by the cot to ask
forgiveness for my ungratefulness and my bitterness. While kneeling there I heard
a song being sung in an adjoining tent. A number of Mormon boys met regularly
every Tuesday night. I usually met with them. We would sit on the floor and have
a Mutual Improvement Association. As I was kneeling there, praying for
forgiveness, I heard their voices singing:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">It may not be on the mountain height</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Or over the stormy sea;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">It may not be at the battle&#8217;s front</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">My Lord will have need of me.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">But if, by a still, small voice he calls</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">To paths that I do not know,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">I&#8217;ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I arose from my knees a humble man. And now, almost fifty years later, I look up
to him and say, &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for cutting me down, for loving me
enough to hurt me&#8221;</i> (Hugh B. Brown, &#8220;The Currant Bush,&#8221; New Era, Jan. 1973, p.
14).</p>
<p>I first read this talk by President Brown as a teenager living in Provo, Utah. I later shared this
talk many times with missionaries when I was teaching at the Missionary Training Center.
Several years after my graduation from BYU, it became an inspired answer to my prayers at a
pivotal point of my professional career when deep disappointment turned into faithful
acceptance.</p>
<p>President Brown&#8217;s story of the gardener and the currant bush also teaches us another principle
about revelation. Many times we think that Heavenly Father inspires us only about spiritual
matters &#8211; giving a talk in church, understanding a scripture, or nudging us to bear testimony to a
nonmember friend. I&#8217;m convinced that He is interested in all aspects of our life and is willing to
reveal truth and wisdom if we are willing to listen.</p>
<p>President James E. Faust teaches:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Personal revelation comes as a testimony of truth and as guidance in spiritual
and temporal matters. Members of the Church know that the promptings of the
spirit may be received upon all facets of life, including daily, ongoing decisions</i>
(&#8220;Communion with the Holy Spirit,&#8221; Ensign, May 1980, p. 13).</p>
<p>Recently I was invited to read the autobiography of Elder John A. Widtsoe, entitled 
		<i>In a Sunlit
Land</i>. It was fascinating for me to learn principles of administration at large universities through
the eyes of an apostle. Elder Widtsoe presided over the Utah State Agricultural College, now
Utah State University, followed by the same assignment at the University of Utah. He was highly
accomplished in his own academic career, receiving his undergraduate degree at Harvard
University and doctor of philosophy in Germany. Elder Widtsoe performed extensive research in
the areas of agriculture and irrigation.</p>
<p>Like all great men, his life was not without challenges. The following excerpt from his
autobiography illustrates the importance of personal revelation in Elder Widtsoe&#8217;s professional
life.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The temple is particularly a place of revelation. Many experiences have proved it.
Perhaps the most impressive is this: For several years, under a federal grant with
my staff of workers, we had gathered thousands of data in the field of soil
moisture; but I could not extract any general law running through them. I gave up
at last. My wife and I went to the temple that day to forget the failure. In the third
endowment room, out of the unseen, came the solution, which has long since gone
into print</i> (In a Sunlit Land, John A. Widtsoe, p. 177).</p>
<p>As students of BYU-Idaho, you are in an environment where you are being taught secular
knowledge through the light of the gospel. I believe that a loving Heavenly Father continues to
reach out to each one of you as you observe the intersections of secular and spiritual knowledge.
This principle is illustrated by a letter from a BYU student to Elder Merrill J. Bateman when he
was president of Brigham Young University:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Recently I sat in a physics class and had the Holy Ghost teach me. We were
discussing fiber optics and how light travels perfectly through strands of plastic
without losing energy. I realized as the lecture proceeded that all things point to
Christ. Christ has all power and never &#8220;loses energy&#8221; as he influences our lives. I
sat in awe at the understanding that came to me; not a physical understanding but
a spiritual enlightenment filled my soul. I came out of that lecture on a spiritual
high</i> (&#8220;Learning in the Light of Truth,&#8221; Merrill J. Bateman, BYU Annual
University Conference, 21 August 2000).</p>
<p>The exciting and yet challenging aspect of personal revelation is we don&#8217;t know when or under
what circumstances whisperings of the Holy Ghost will come. In January 1992, I attended a
fireside where Gerald Lund, now a member of the Seventy, was the speaker. His topic was
personal revelation. He shared the following statement that I have applied many times in my own
life and in counseling others. &#8220;The Lord alone decides when revelation is given, to whom it is
given, how it is given, and what is revealed.&#8221; I have found this statement to be totally consistent
with gospel truths. Revelation is a gift from God, a perfect Father who loves each one of us.</p>
<p>Because our Heavenly Father determines when revelation will be given, it is our responsibility
always to be prepared for receiving revelation. May I share four principles that will help us be
prepared for the time when revelation comes to us.</p>
<p>First, be worthy &#8211; the Lord <i>&#8220;doth not dwell in unholy temples&#8221;</i> (Alma 7:21). Perhaps it&#8217;s because
of my affiliation with the Hawaiian saints that I&#8217;ve always liked the personal experience of
Joseph F. Smith to illustrate the importance of worthiness. At the age of fifteen, Joseph F. Smith
was called on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands. This future prophet of the Church relates the
following personal revelation:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I was very much oppressed, once, on a mission. I was almost naked and entirely
friendless, except the friendship of a poor, benighted, degraded people. I felt as if
I was so debased in my condition of poverty, lack of intelligence and knowledge,
just a boy, that I hardly dared look a white man in the face.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>While in that condition I dreamed that I was on a journey, and I was impressed
that I ought to hurry &#8211; hurry with all my might, for fear I might be too late. I
rushed on my way as fast as I possibly could, and I was only conscious of having
just a little bundle, a handkerchief with a small bundle wrapped in it. I did not
realize just what it was, when I was hurrying as fast as I could; but finally I came
to a wonderful mansion, if it could be called a mansion. It seemed too large, too
great to have been made by hand, but I thought I knew that was my destination.
As I passed towards it, as fast as I could, I saw a notice, &#8220;Bath.&#8221; I turned aside
quickly and went into the bath and washed myself clean. I opened up this little
bundle that I had and there was a pair of white, clean garments, a thing I had not
seen for a long time, because the people I was with did not think very much of
making things exceedingly clean. But my garments were clean, and I put them on.
Then I rushed to what appeared to be a great opening, or door. I knocked and the
door opened, and the man who stood there was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He
looked at me a little reprovingly, and the first words he said: &#8220;Joseph, you are
late.&#8221; Yet I took confidence and said:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;Yes, but I am clean &#8211; I am clean!&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When I awoke that morning I was a man, although only a boy. There was not
anything in the world that I feared. I could meet any man or woman or child and
look them in the face, feeling in my soul that I was a man every whit</i> (Gospel
Doctrine, p. 542-3).</p>
<p>Are there things &#8211; even small ones &#8211; in your life that prevent you from being worthy, that don&#8217;t
allow you to have confidence in the presence of the Lord? If the Lord were to speak with you
today, would you feel worthy to receive His counsel?</p>
<p>Principle number two&#8212;revelation usually comes line upon line. The prophet Nephi declared,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line
upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are
those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they
shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more</i> (2 Nephi 28:30).</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell reaffirmed this principle of measured inspiration:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We have a notable lack of capacity to appreciate things that, like water out of a
fire hydrant, come in a rush. Hence the Lord meters out divine disclosure
according to what is deserved and usable</i> (Quotes from Neal A. Maxwell, p. 289).</p>
<p>A former colleague of mine, Alan L. Wilkins, was serving as Academic Vice President at BYU
when he shared this insight as part of our University Conference. President Harold B. Lee was
[his] grandfather. [Alan remembers] going to him as a young man, just finishing [his] senior year
at BYU, trying to decide what [he] would be when [he] grew up. [Alan] took to [President Lee]
[his] patriarchal blessing and asked him to read it and counsel [him]. [Alan thought] in [his] heart
of hearts, though [he] would not have admitted it at the time, [he] expected that [President Lee&#8217;s]
counsel would operate something like a crystal ball&#8212;that he would help [Alan] find [his]
occupation or, even better, [his] wife, whom [he] still hadn&#8217;t found at that time.</p>
<p>[President Lee] read the blessing and then paused for a minute and said, &#8220;Alan, I think you worry
too much about the future&#8221; (&#8220;Reaching the Heights Prophets Have Envisioned for Us,&#8221; Alan L.
Wilkins, BYU Annual University Conference, 26 August 1996).</p>
<p>Alan related to the group that in hindsight he could see that the Lord was answering questions
about his occupation and his eternal companion, line upon line, precept upon precept. Stating
that it was one of his grandfather&#8217;s favorite hymns, Alan then recited the first verse of &#8220;Lead,
Kindly Light&#8221;:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Lead, kindly light, amid th&#8217; encircling gloom;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Lead thou me on!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The night is dark, and I am far from home;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Lead thou me on!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The distant scene&#8212;one step enough for me.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(Hymns, no. 97)</p>
<p>Do you have questions about your future? Do you have the patience and faith that your questions
will be answered line upon line &#8211; or do you insist on knowing the end from the beginning?</p>
<p>Principle number three &#8211; ask the right question. We are better prepared to hear and understand
the Lord&#8217;s answer when we ask the right question. In the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, the Lord
teaches, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will
in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask . . .</i> (Doctrine &amp; Covenants
50:29-30).</p>
<p>If we want to receive the right answer to our prayers, we need to ask the right question of the
Lord. Many times the Lord inspires us to know which question to ask. May I share the following
experience in my life.</p>
<p>Eight years ago we were living in Provo, Utah, and our young family was active in church and
school programs. As a result of my calling in the stake, I was expected to attend a temple session
one evening in preparation for a ward conference. Earlier that afternoon, I was to have a meeting
in the Commissioner&#8217;s Office in Salt Lake City. My son&#8217;s high school team was playing in the
state basketball tournament also in Salt Lake City. I felt like I should stay in Salt Lake and
support him in the tournament, which meant I would not be able to attend the temple session that
evening in Provo.</p>
<p>I was fixing a quick sandwich at home on my way to Salt Lake when I shared this conflict with
my wife. She listened patiently, as she always does, and simply asked the question, &#8220;Does it
really matter if you don&#8217;t go to the temple with the ward?&#8221; Like most wives, Debbie has the way
of making complicated issues seem very simple.</p>
<p>I left for my meeting, but her question kept echoing in my ears. Did it really matter whether I
was with the ward that evening in the temple? By the time I was halfway to Salt Lake City, I
knew what I should do. I called the bishop on my cell phone, explained to him the situation, and
asked to be excused from the temple session that evening. He encouraged me to support my son
in the state tournament and reaffirmed to me the importance of putting families first.</p>
<p>I must admit that I remember neither the meeting in the Commissioner&#8217;s Office nor the
basketball game at the Huntsman Center, but I do remember driving home with my 17-year-old
son after the game. He was excited, even surprised, to see me at the game. We had a wonderful
talk together.</p>
<p>The story doesn&#8217;t end there. I also remember the talk given by the bishop in sacrament meeting
at the ward conference that Sunday. He was a wise priesthood leader with many years of
leadership experience. His message that day in sacrament meeting was a familiar theme taught
by President David O. McKay. &#8220;No other success can compensate for failure in the home.&#8221; He
encouraged each of his ward members to put their families first and to have faith in the Lord&#8217;s
promises through the sealing covenants.</p>
<p>It was my opportunity to share some remarks to close the meeting. My prepared talk was put
away and I spoke from the heart, reaffirming the teachings of love and loyalty to the family we
had just heard from this inspired bishop. How grateful I was that a loving Heavenly Father had
given me the courage to do the right thing and miss a priesthood assignment to be with my son.
This courage came because my wife had suggested the right question, &#8220;Does it really matter if
you don&#8217;t go to the temple with the ward?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I end this story, I suspect that some of you are bothered that I went to a basketball game
instead of the temple. Let me add that I attended a temple session later in the week to complete
my preparation for that ward conference.</p>
<p>Do you try to simplify your concerns into a single question? Do you tend to answer that question
before the Lord touches your heart?</p>
<p>Remember that a young 14-year-old boy went to a grove of trees with a question to ask the Lord.
When he asked a specific question, perhaps the right question, the heavens were opened and the
last dispensation commenced.</p>
<p>The fourth and final principle is to act with faith. We need to exercise our faith and act on these
spiritual impressions with a determination to carry out the Lord&#8217;s will. I believe we are more
able to receive revelation if we already have decided to do what the Lord commands when He
speaks to us.</p>
<p>This principle is illustrated in a dramatic fashion in the first chapters of the Book of Mormon.
Nephi had just proclaimed his unwavering faith in the Lord, <i>&#8220;I will go and do the things which
the Lord hath commanded . . .&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 3:7) only to have that faith challenged by a remarkable
test.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll recall that Nephi and his brothers returned to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates from
Laban. After unsuccessful attempts, Nephi went alone and <i>&#8220;was led by the Spirit . . . And as</i> [he]<i>
came near unto the house of Laban, </i>[he] <i>beheld a man, and . . . found that it was Laban&#8221;</i> (1
Nephi 4:6-8). Nephi beheld Laban&#8217;s sword and drew it from the sheath. Then Nephi reports:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban;
but I said in my heart: never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I
shrunk and would that I might not slay him . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath
delivered him into thy hands;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is
better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in
unbelief </i>(1 Nephi 4:10, 12-13).</p>
<p>With this important insight, Nephi was able to understand the purposes of the Lord and obey His
command with exactness. Nephi <i>&#8220;took Laban by the hair of the head, and</i> (he) 
		<i>smote his head
with his own sword&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 4:18).</p>
<p>Sometimes we don&#8217;t have the luxury of understanding the Lord&#8217;s purposes before we need to act.
Nevertheless, we are still expected to exercise our faith and respond obediently to the spiritual
impression. May I share a personal example that, although it&#8217;s not nearly as dramatic as Nephi&#8217;s
experience, has given me satisfaction that maybe once I had the courage to follow the
whisperings of the Spirit.</p>
<p>About ten years ago I was serving as a stake president. During one of my visits to a sacrament
meeting, a young priest struggled with reading the sacrament prayer for the bread. After four
unsuccessful attempts, he asked one of the other priests to say the sacrament prayer. As the
deacons passed the bread to the congregation, I glanced at this young priest who sat embarrassed
with his head down. Since we had just moved into the stake a year before, I did not know him or
his family.</p>
<p>In an instant, two thoughts came into my mind. This young man must not have negative thoughts
or experiences related to the sacrament. Second, he should say the blessing on the water. I turned
to the bishop at my side and asked him to invite the young priest to say the sacrament prayer for
the water. The bishop looked at me surprised and asked, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; I nodded my head, yes.</p>
<p>The bishop leaned forward and caught the attention of one of the other priests. He nudged this
young priest, who looked at the bishop. The bishop clearly whispered, &#8220;Say the prayer on the
water.&#8221; I glanced at the young priest out of the corner of my eye. This young priest had the same
look of surprise that the bishop did just a moment before, but the young priest&#8217;s face also had a
look of terror.</p>
<p>Then the reality of what I had initiated began to sink in. What if the young priest were not able to
say the blessing on the water successfully? At what point do we have him stop trying? Was I
right to put this young man in a position of further embarrassing himself?</p>
<p>I knew that the impressions that I had felt were from the Holy Ghost, but questions such as these
continued through my mind. So I began to pray. I suspect that I was not the only one on the stand
who was praying while the bread was being passed.</p>
<p>The deacons returned with the bread trays. The priests reverently placed the bread trays on the
sacrament table. The cloth was lifted to cover the bread trays and uncover the water trays. Then
this young priest knelt down to pray. I listened to each word as it came clearly from his mouth. I
would not have been paying more attention if I were giving the prayer myself. As he finished the
blessing on the water and pronounced the final word &#8220;amen,&#8221; the congregation seemed to give
their approving &#8220;amen&#8221; with more clarity and conviction than normal. This congregation, filled
with experienced Church leaders and loving families, had recognized the situation and were
grateful for this young man&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>In the next two years, I had the opportunity to interview this young man to receive the
Melchizedek Priesthood, prepare his papers for full-time missionary service, interview him to
enter the House of the Lord, and set him apart to serve in the North Carolina Charlotte Mission.
With each opportunity of meeting with him, I asked the young man if he remembered the
experience at the sacrament table. He always answered, &#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; And it was always with a
smile and a look of gratitude for priesthood leaders who had confidence in him to perform the
sacred ordinance of the sacrament.</p>
<p>My reflection on this and similar experiences reminds me that when I allow doubts about
following the Spirit to enter my mind, it&#8217;s because I fear man more than God. In other words,
I&#8217;m more concerned about the outward consequences of embarrassment or ridicule from another
person than to follow the sacred impressions from our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>This important lesson was taught to the young prophet Joseph Smith when he allowed the 116
pages of the original manuscript to be lost. The Lord&#8217;s counsel to him included the clear
principle<i> &#8220;you should not have feared man more than God&#8221;</i> (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 3:7).</p>
<p>When you seek the Lord&#8217;s counsel, do you have the determination of Nephi to do whatever the
Lord commands? Do you become distracted by the effects of possible consequences? Do you
fear God more than man?</p>
<p>As part of the great plan of happiness, we have knowledge that each of us is a child of God. Our
Heavenly Father wants us to be happy in this life and prepared to live with Him as families
forever. As a loving Father, He reaches out and communicates with us, spirit to spirit, through
personal revelation. Personal revelation is a divine expression of His love to each of us, His
children.</p>
<p>In summary, four steps we can take to be ready when revelation comes are:</p>
<p>1. Be worthy</p>
<p>2. Remember that knowledge is usually revealed line upon line</p>
<p>3. Ask the right question</p>
<p>4. Act with faith</p>
<p>May each of us be prepared for receiving His counsel and then may we obey with exactness, in
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Oh, how lovely was the morning, radiant beamed the sun above, bees were humming sweet
birds singing&#8221;</i> (<i>Joseph Smith&#8217;s First Prayer</i>, <i>Hymns</i> 26). In Joseph Smith&#8217;s own words,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen
hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an
attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray
vocally </i>(Joseph Smith History 1:14).</p>
<p>What is this event called prayer? What do we know about prayer? Essentially it is the means or
process of communicating with our God. Through all generations of time, reaching out for God&#8217;s
supplications has been called prayer. The beautiful hymn teaches that, <i>&#8220;Prayer is the soul&#8217;s
sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed&#8221; </i>(<i>Prayer is the Soul&#8217;s Sincere Desire</i>, Hymns 145). There
are many forms of prayer: vocal, silent, personal, public, family, private or communal. There are
particular prayers that have been specified such as baptism and the sacrament prayers. Prayer
plays a vital part in our worship, our religious thinking and our daily lives and ultimately our
salvation. </p>
<p>From the beginning of the human journey on the earth, we have been commanded to seek the
Lord in prayer. The first commandment that the Lord gave Adam and Eve was to pray, or to
worship God (Moses 5:5). They were obedient. Adam builded him an altar and called upon the
name of the Lord.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And after the birth of Seth to Adam and Eve, the Lord revealed himself unto Seth
and he rebelled not, but offered an acceptable sacrifice like unto his brother Abel</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . And then began these men to call upon the name of the Lord, and the Lord
blessed them</i> (Moses 6:3-4).</p>
<p>We have all been counseled to &#8216;call on the name of the Lord&#8217; so that He can bless us. Alma gives
us some very specific instructions about calling upon the Lord. In Alma 34:17-23 we find,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise
your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he
would have mercy upon you</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea cry unto him for mercy; for his is mighty to save.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Cry unto him in your house, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day
and evening.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, cry unto him against the devil . . .</i></p>
<p>Well you get the idea. I would add pray about your school, your work, your spouse or search for
a spouse and every important decision. Continuing on in Alma,<i> &#8220;Yea, and when you do not cry
unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare,
and also for the welfare of those who are around you&#8221;</i> (Alma 34:27).</p>
<p>This answers any questions we might have about whether the Lord cares, in detail, about the
things that we care about, that effect our lives. </p>
<p>Through Joseph Smith&#8217;s experiences in restoring the gospel, we have learned much about prayer.
For example, regarding his first experience in praying, he tells us,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and
incessantly.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these
parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter
and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him</i> (Joseph
Smith History 1:9,11).</p>
<p>How are we like Joseph? Don&#8217;t you ever wonder about what you should do, or the line between
right and wrong? The world gives us mixed messages. Traditional American values seemed
much closer to the moral values of our church in the past. Rapidly, things are changing and
causing great confusion to many. Does the will of the Lord change? No, it is constant. So, what
is right? What is important in your lives? What really matters? As in Lehi&#8217;s vision, there are
spacious buildings and there are rivers of filthy water. There are R-rated movies and television.
There is pornography and gambling. There are drugs, alcohol, tobacco and other addictive
substances. There are choices about what to wear that constitute acceptable, fashionable dress
that is modest. What are Sunday activities that honor the Lord&#8217;s commandment to keep the
Sabbath day holy? What are the worldly idols that we worship? Where and on what do we spend
our time? What do we read and what music do we listen to? Where is the iron rod to cling to? Do
you take seriously the need to find answers? Prayer is our constant connection to our Father in
Heaven. It is the magnet that draws us to the iron rod.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith&#8217;s example of searching the scriptures, reflecting, and then acting is important.
Referring to the passage in James that I just read, Joseph Smith tells us, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man
than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every
feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person
needed wisdom from God, I did:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>At length I came to the determination to &#8220;ask of god,&#8221; concluding that if he gave
wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I
might venture.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the
woods to make the attempt</i> (Joseph Smith History 1:12-14).</p>
<p>What happened next changed the world; it has a great personal message for each of us. After his
wrestle with the very real powers of darkness, Joseph explained that he saw</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above
me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing
to the other &#8211; This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him</i> (Joseph Smith History 1:17).</p>
<p>Now when we pray, we know that there are two distinct beings, God the Father and His Son,
Jesus Christ. We pray to God the Father in the name of His beloved Son, Jesus Christ by the
power of the Holy Ghost. We know that they know each one of us, even by name! They care
about us personally and individually as they care about us collectively. We know that prayers,
uttered in faith will be answered. </p>
<p>As a very young child, I had hiked up to a waterfall with my parents. On our way down the
mountain, I decided to take a little shortcut to the path down below and surprise my parents. To
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> surprise, I did not come to the path and after wandering for what seemed to be a long time to
me, I became very frightened. I don&#8217;t remember specifically being taught to pray but I know that
my first thought when I was in trouble was to kneel to the ground and ask the Lord to help me
find my parents. No sooner had I stood up than my father came through the brush and said, &#8220;Oh
there you are you little scamp.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know if I was seriously lost but 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">I knew</span> that my prayer
was answered. It is the first time I really have a memory of praying and it gave me a testimony
that Heavenly Father does answer prayers, even those of a little scamp.</p>
<p>Nephi taught us, <i>&#8220;&#8230;wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me&#8230;&#8221; 
		</i>(1 Nephi
2:16).<i> &#8220;And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the
Lord showed unto me great things&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 18:3).</p>
<p>The Lord continues to bless those who, in humility, call upon His name. It is unlikely that most
of us will have such experiences as Joseph Smith and Nephi. But our prayers will be just as
important to our salvation as were theirs. You will remember the time when Alma in the Book of
Mormon was converted to the message of Abinadi and had lead a group of the believers away
where they could worship their God. After being discovered by the Lamanites, Alma&#8217;s people
were required to labor extensively. Amulon, one of the wicked priests of King Noah who had
found favor with the King of the Lamanites, was placed in a position where he exercised
authority over Alma and his people.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;and </i>[he] 
		<i>put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry
mightily to God.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards
over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God
should be put to death.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did
pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts</i>.</p>
<p>Here is the miraculous answer to their prayers:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions,

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his
brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear
up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all
the will of the Lord</i> (Mosiah 23:9-15). </p>
<p>Do you have burdens that you would like to bear with ease? Have we not been advised that we
can give our burdens to the Lord? This can be as literal as the burdens of Alma&#8217;s people. He has
already suffered our tribulations so we can ask for His help in bearing all of our challenges. In
Psalms we are taught, <i>&#8220;Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never
suffer the righteous to be moved&#8221;</i> (Pslams 55:22). Too often we think that no one can understand
what we are going through, that we are the only ones to whom this problem has happened. While
each of us is a designer original, Christ knows how we feel for He has suffered 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> things that He
might succor us in our need. This example of Alma&#8217;s people can also help us to understand that
there is strength in petitioning the Lord collectively and uniting our faith. Many times in our
church we are asked to pray for rain to fall in times of drought, or for special needs in a ward or
a stake in behalf of members or families. I have been witness to the answers to these prayers.</p>
<p>The great plan of salvation includes challenges for us to overcome here upon the earth. In fact,
this earth was created for us to continue our progress, to be tempted and tried with the great gift
of our mortal body, that we could become like our Father in Heaven. </p>
<p>I have witnessed healings and many other quiet but amazing small miracles through the prayer of
faith. I have also witnessed many prayers of faith that weren&#8217;t answered in the way that was
expected. Prayers are <span style="text-decoration: underline">always</span> answered, but sometimes the answer is no, for there is a larger
purpose in the Lord. For example, all would have prayed that Joseph Smith would not have been
martyred&#8230;.but the Lord knew he needed to seal his testimony with his blood. None of us can
bear to see a loved one called home, but we will all taste of death and pass from this life. We do
not know when it is our appointed hour. The struggles of many of the pioneers could have been
prayed away but these struggles sanctified them before the Lord, and they are great examples of
faith to all who followed. Sometimes our prayers are answered with a &#8220;not now.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t the
right time. Some prayers are answered little by little, insight upon insight so that we arrive at a
level of understanding that we would not had the answer been granted all at once. 
		</p>
<p>We would choose to avoid pain, trials, and suffering, but the Lord in His wisdom allows us to
have these experiences that we might grow to become what He knows we can become. He has
answers that we do not have. However, He has not left us comfortless. If we draw close to Him,
we will be comforted in all of the trials we have to bear. He will not ask us to bear anything
beyond our capacity. Often we look back at our greatest trials and disappointments and realize
that they were or lead to greater blessings. </p>
<p>Imagine yourself floundering in the ocean. You tread water for a time as you are moved about by
the waves. Soon your own strength does not allow you to resist the pull of gravity and the
buffeting of the sea anymore. Suddenly you become aware of a lifeline that has been tossed to
you that you can catch hold of and stay connected until it time to lift you out of the water to a
place of safety. Prayer is like a lifeline. It 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> our lifeline. It is our divine connection to our
creator.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is out of love that we are commanded to pray. Because the Father loved us so much, He sent
his son who willing accepted the trial to suffer unspeakably to atone for our sins that they could
provide a way for us to go back to live with them. </p>
<p>The Lord speaks to us in the Doctrine and Covenants 29:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I am, whose arm of
mercy hath atoned for your sins;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,
even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves before me, and
call upon me in mighty prayer</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 29:1-2). </p>
<p>Jesus Christ&#8217;s arm of mercy reaches out to us as He invites us to pray to our Heavenly Father in
His name. The Lord knew we could not be perfect in this life, but He who is perfect can and
desires to guide us. It is His perfect love for us that invites us to draw close to Him in prayer that
He may guide us, prompt us and yes, even reveal truths for our knowledge and good. The Holy
Ghost will make us smarter, wiser, strengthen us, inspire, testify and even heal us. What a
remarkable gift! </p>
<p>There are three things that seem important to me regarding prayer. We must 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">seek,</span> and then
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">listen</span>, and then 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">act</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Seek</span></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">seek</span> me diligently and ye shall find me; ask
and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 88:63).</p>
<p>The Lord makes the point many times that to commune with Him we must seek. In fact, we have
been commanded to seek Him. He has made it clear that this is an important commandment and
it is evil not to obey. The otherwise righteous brother of Jared found this out in a very personal
and profound way. In Ether 2:14-15 it says,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the
brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. And for the space of
three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him
because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did call
upon the name of the Lord.</i></p>
<p>In Jeremiah we find a beautiful promise if we are obedient and seek the Lord through prayer:<i>
&#8220;Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And
ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart&#8221;</i> (Jeremiah 29:12-13). 
		</p>
<p>Think about it. Whenever God has given insight, revelation, or inspiration, it is usually because
of sincere seeking. Joseph Smith would not have had the first vision had he not sought the Lord
in prayer. Most of the revelations that were given for the restoration of the church came as a
result of inquiring of the Lord. </p>
<p>How do we seek? I believe that the Lord expects us to &#8220;really seek.&#8221; Remember the account of
Enos praying: <i>&#8220;And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto
him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto
him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens&#8221;</i>
(Enos 1:4) This was not a casual prayer with vain repetitions but mighty prayer with sincere
heartfelt gratitude and pleadings. I believe our Lord wishes us to pray from our heart. 
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Listen</span></p>
<p>The second consideration encompassed in prayer is listening. Part of seeking is to allow space
for the answer. Pondering what we will pray for before a prayer can help us focus on the
promptings that may come during or after our prayer. Our attitude of humility as we enter His
presence in prayer helps us to be prepared to receive the answers. And remember, &#8220;Seek not to
counsel the Lord but to take counsel from his hand&#8221; (Jacob 4:10).</p>
<p>The Lord taught us an important principle of feeling His spirit and receiving promptings as He
counseled Oliver Cowdery.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, thou knowest that thou has inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind;
and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou has been
enlightened by the Spirit of truth</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto
me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness
can you have than from God?</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 6:15, 22-23)</p>
<p>And further he was told,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto
you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But, behold, I say unto you that you must study it out in your mind; then you must
ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn
within you; therefore, you shall <span style="text-decoration: underline">feel</span> that it is right.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">feelings</span>, but you shall have a stupor
of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 9: 7-9, emphasis added). </p>
<p>This instruction teaches that we have to honor the subtle feelings and impressions we are given.
Sister Sherry Dew says, <i>&#8220;Our challenge is not getting the Lord speak to us; our challenge is
understanding what He has to say</i>&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>No one Can Take your Place</i></span>, Sheri Dew, Deseret Book,
Salt Lake City, 2004). I believe this takes practice as I have come to recognize these promptings
from the Spirit much more than I did in the past and I&#8217;m sure I have a long way yet to go. The
Lord knows before we pray of what we are in need. He asks us to humble ourselves and come to
Him that He can bless us.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Act</span></p>
<p>It takes faith to pray, but faith without works is dead. The third sequence of prayer is to act. It
takes action to pray and action after we pray. What would have happened if Joseph had not acted
upon the answer to his prayer? The result of that prayer in the Sacred Grove opened a new
dispensation and restored the gospel to the earth. It also set Joseph on a short lifetime of work,
effort, inconvenience, tribulation, joy and finally his death. Do you think that the Lord knew that
Joseph would act on the counsel he was given? Do you think the Lord reserved you to come to
the earth at this time because he had confidence that you would act on your testimonies and build
the kingdom prior to His coming? </p>
<p>When we pray, we must do our part to fulfill the answer. As we ask for health and strength we
can live the word of wisdom and exercise and take care of our bodies. As we pray for wisdom
and knowledge, we can study and apply ourselves. As we ask for protection, we can use good
judgment in driving carefully and not putting ourselves in harms way for the sake of a thrilling
experience. When we pray for inspiration we must keep the commandments to be worthy to
receive that inspiration. We can turn to His words in the scriptures, for many answers have been
given there and we can be guided through our reading and pondering.</p>
<p>Avoiding the world and secluding ourselves isn&#8217;t an option. We receive our errand from the Lord
and then labor in his vineyard. By our works we shall be known. If we 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">seek</span> the Lord and ask
what He would have us do, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">listen</span>, we can plan to be very busy. There is much to be done.
Now, I know that many of you will leave today and try to do more, and more, be better, and take
more action. A little caution &#8211; As you pray, you may find an affirmation as you listen, that you
are doing just fine, you are on the right track. All things must be done in order and wisdom, and
in their own time. We have been counseled not to run faster than we are able. 
		</p>
<p>Have you noticed that today we have not addressed the weighty and important things that we
must each accomplish on this earth to obtain exaltation? We have not talked about baptism,
repentance, temple covenants, temple marriage, service, raising families or enduring to the end.
These are all most important. However, to accomplish any of these things, we must first have His
spirit with us; we must have a pure heart. We cannot do this alone. If we have the constant
companionship of the spirit, we can do all things. From Philippians 4:13 we read, 
		<i>&#8220;I can do all
things in Christ which strengthen me.&#8221;</i> President Hinckley has told us that the Lord can make
more of us than we can make of ourselves. We must keep the divine connection and draw close
to our Heavenly Father or we will be quickly drawn away to follow the paths of the world. To
have His spirit, we must seek Him through prayer. We must draw close to Him and listen and
hear his promptings. Then we must move forward with action. </p>
<p>Of greatest concern is that many find little incentive to pray. Life is really quite pleasant and
some find little need to seek God because of their comfortable lives. </p>
<p>President Faust tells of a little 5-year-old boy whom he interviewed and asked if he said his
prayers at night. The answer came, &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; President Faust then asked, &#8220;Do you say your
prayers in the morning?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; replied the little boy. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t scared in the morning.&#8221; Too often
we wait until there is a crisis before we turn to the Lord. Why should we pray if we aren&#8217;t scared
or don&#8217;t have immediate problems? One compelling reason is found in Doctrine and Covenants
61:39: <i>&#8220;Pray always that you enter not into temptation, that you may abide the day of his
coming, whether in life or in death.&#8221;</i> None of us knows when we will be called home.</p>
<p>Much has been written about the unquestionable events that will occur prior to the coming of
Christ. In Doctrine and Covenants 64:31 it says, <i>&#8220;I the Lord, declare unto you, my words are
sure and shall not fail.&#8221; </i>All that the Lord has told us in the scriptures and through our Prophets
will surely come to pass. Recall the parable of the Ten Virgins. Five were prepared and five were
not prepared at the coming of the bridegroom. If we take His council and warnings lightly, we
will not be prepared when He comes. We need to pray to keep ourselves in the pathway that
leads us to obedience to the commandments. </p>
<p>Our God is no respecter of persons; He is available at all times. We don&#8217;t need an appointment;
we don&#8217;t need to pay for services. He doesn&#8217;t care for our station in the world, our age, our
wealth or our color, only the humility of our hearts. Each one of us has complete access at any
time. Do you have any idea how much the Lord loves you? We cannot even imagine how much
His sacrifice for us is beyond comprehension. He pleads for us to come unto Him.</p>
<p>As always, we can look to the Savior as our perfect example. On many occasions, He prayed to
His Heavenly Father. After his example, He teaches us: <i>&#8220;The works which ye have seen me do,
that shall ye also do&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi. 27: 21).</p>
<p>The great intercessory prayer, just prior to Christ&#8217;s death, is one of the most moving passages of
all scripture. This prayer is for each of us. Recorded in John, chapter 17, may I read a selected
few of the these verses: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the
hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as
many as thou hast given him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me
to do.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me;
for they are thine.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to
thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me,
that they may be one, as we are.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the
world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved
me . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love
wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them</i> (John 17:1-4, 9-11,
23-24, 26).</p>
<p>Finally in Luke 23: 34, Christ utters perhaps His last prayer on earth before His crucifixion:<i>
&#8220;Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>After the resurrection, as Christ left the people on the American continent, He promised,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now I go unto the Father. And verily I say unto you, whatsoever things ye
shall ask the Father in my name shall be given unto you. Therefore, ask, and ye
shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; for he that asketh,
receiveth; and unto him that knocketh, it shall be opened</i> (3 Nephi 27:28-29).</p>
<p>To ask, to knock, is to pray.</p>
<p>Again, may I draw from a hymn, <i>Reverently and Meekly Now,</i> 4<sup>th</sup> verse:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>At the throne I intercede;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For thee ever do I plead,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I have loved thee as thy friend,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>With a love that cannot end.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Be obedient, I implore,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Prayerful watchful, ever more,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And be constant unto me,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That thy Savior I may be</i> (<i>Hymns</i> 185).</p>
<p>I have an absolute testimony of the power and the necessity of prayer. Offering this opportunity
to His children, is a benevolent, loving gift. I know that our Father in Heaven and His Son live
and they love us, and know and care about each of us. I love Joseph Smith for his passion to
know the truth and his courage to <span style="text-decoration: underline">seek</span> God through prayer, for 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">listening</span> and learning, for 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">acting</span>
on the knowledge he was given that we might be partakers of the good news of the gospel. The
Lord loved Joseph and his brother Hyrum and all who serve him. I am grateful for a living
prophet who guides us today. I pray that it could be said of each of you as it was of Hyrum Smith
in Doctrines and Covenants 124:15: <i>&#8220;And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant
Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he
loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am so grateful to have been asked to be with you today. Thank
you for your goodness and for the beautiful spirit I have felt here. This school has a special
meaning for me and my husband who met here, were students here, and where I taught for three
years. You are truly a chosen generation.</p>
<p>May I close with the plea of Moroni 7:48:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">pray unto the Father with all the energy of
heart,</span> that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who
are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God;
that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that
we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure</i> (emphasis
added).</p>
<p>I pray that this may be so, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><br /><br />
</p>
<p>My dear young students: I keenly feel my responsibility to testify of truths which will strengthen
your growing faith. That desire has driven me to my knees many times in preparation of my
message.</p>
<p>More than a year ago, half a world away in the city of Moscow, Russia, a young sister about
your age spoke to me of her friendship with a troubled non-member boy. He had been raised in a
Communist home. He frequently inquired of her, &#8220;Where is God?&#8221;</p>
<p>Especially during university years, that question will often be asked of young people by those
whose wisdom is self-appointed. If faith in God&#8217;s existence and your relationship with Him is
lost while you acquire an education, you will also lose your testimony that you are His child and
have the potential to become like Him.</p>
<p>In moments of extremity, men and women of all generations have asked where God is. The
Prophet Joseph did so from Liberty Jail in the familiar language of Section 121 of the Doctrine
and Covenants: <i>&#8220;O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding
place?&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 121:1)</p>
<p>God often had to counsel the suffering Saints, <i>&#8220;Be still and know that I am God&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 101:16). Even Christ in the concluding hours of His atoning sacrifice cried out, 
		<i>&#8220;My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221;</i> (Matthew 27:46)</p>
<p>More than a century ago Robert G. Ingersoll, an American agnostic, pursued this question in the
following words:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

and the raw materials cost so little that generally the god market was fairly
glutted with these phantoms</i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Works of Robert G. Ingersoll</span>, Vol. 1 [1900], 7,
10, 23, 24).</p>
<p>In paraphrasing a famous quotation from Alexander Pope, Ingersoll irreverently concluded: 
		<i>&#8220;An
honest god is the noblest work of man&#8221; </i>(Ibid 7).</p>
<p>People of all ages have delighted in pitting the strength or wisdom of their gods against that of
their neighbors&#8217; gods. Two of the most interesting and consequential contests are recorded in the
Old Testament. </p>
<p>One took place over 2500 years ago on Mount Carmel between the Lord God of Israel,
represented by his prophet Elijah, and the Phoenician god Baal, represented in turn by his 450
prophets. How piercing was Elijah&#8217;s challenge, <i>&#8220;How long halt ye between two opinions? If the
Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The heavens silently ignored the incantations and pleading to Baal&#8217;s dumb and brazen idols.
Elijah mocked, <i>&#8220;Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a
journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awakened.&#8221;</i> Man-made gods never fared well
in the presence of real deity.</p>
<p>When it was Elijah&#8217;s turn he prayed openly: <i>&#8220;Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it
be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant&#8230;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones,
and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. The people fell on their faces and
proclaimed: <i>&#8220;The Lord, he is...God; the Lord, he is...God&#8221;</i> (1 Kings 18:21, 27, 36, 38-39).</p>
<p>No less impressive in story or message was the contest between Moses and the magicians of
Pharaoh. Moses pled:<i> &#8220;Let my people go&#8221; </i>(Exodus 5:1). But the heart of Ramses was as stone.
Moses transformed a rod into a serpent. He smote the waters of Egypt that they turned to blood,
and the fish died and the waters stank. He inflicted the land with frogs and with lice and swarms
of flies, and a plague upon the cattle of Egypt, and boils, and blains, and hail, and fire, and
locusts, and thick darkness. But the heart of Pharaoh would not soften. His magicians could
duplicate some of the miracles, but not all &#8211; and even they pled for the release of Israel when
Israel&#8217;s God smote their firstborn sons. Stubborn Pharaoh finally discovered life&#8217;s greatest truth
when the message was brought to him of the destruction of his army by the crashing waters of
the Red Sea.</p>
<p>As portrayed by Cecil B. DeMille on the motion picture screen, we can imagine Pharaoh upon
his throne pondering, then muttering in eloquence: &#8220;Moses&#8217; God is God&#8221; (Motion Picture: 
		<i>The
Ten Commandments</i>).</p>
<p>In their preoccupation to worship a powerful and respectable god, ancient civilizations often
fashioned multiple deities as the objects of their reverence. It never occurred to them to have no
god. That sin was left to our more sophisticated society. </p>
<p>William Jennings Bryan, eloquent speaker of a generation past, and once the United States
Secretary of State, penned these words in response to Charles Darwin&#8217;s Origin of the Species: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>[H]ow does the evolutionist explain the eye when he leaves God out? 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The evolutionist guesses that there was a time when eyes were unknown. And
since the eye is a universal possession among living things the evolutionist
guesses that it came into being &#8211; not by design or by act of God &#8211; but just
happened, and how did it happen? A piece of pigment, or, as some say, a freckle
appeared upon the skin of an animal that had no eyes. This piece of pigment or
freckle converged the rays of the sun upon that spot and when the little animal felt
the heat on that spot it turned the spot to the sun to get more heat. The increased
heat irritated the skin &#8211; so the evolutionists guess, and a nerve came there and out
of the nerve came the eye! But this only accounts for one eye; there must have
been another piece of pigment or freckle soon afterward and just in the right
place in order to give the animal two eyes.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And, according to the evolutionist, there was a time when animals had no legs,
and so the leg came by accident. How? Well, the guess is that a little animal
without legs was wiggling along on its belly one day when it discovered a wart,
and it was in the right place to be used to aid it in locomotion; so, it came to
depend upon the wart, and use finally developed it into a leg. And then another
wart and another leg, at the proper time &#8211; by accident &#8211; and accidentally in the
proper place. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>How long did the &#8220;light waves&#8221; have to play on the skin before the eyes came
out? The evolutionist is very deliberate; he is long on time. He would certainly
give the eye thousands of years, if not millions, in which to develop; but how
could he be sure that the light waves played all the time in one place or played in
the same place generation after generation until the development was complete?
And why did the light waves quit playing when two eyes were perfected? Why did
they not keep on playing until there were eyes all over the body? Why do they not
play today, so that we may see eyes in process of development? And if the light
waves created the eyes, why did they not create them strong enough to bear the
light? Why did the light waves makes eyes and then make eyelids to keep the light
out of the eyes?</i> (William Jennings Bryan, <i>In His Image</i>, [1922] 97-100).</p>
<p>Naturalism&#8217;s explanations often appear convoluted and grotesque when placed side-by-side with
the simple, yet beautiful truths of the revealed word and divine scripture. Joseph Smith said: 
		<i>&#8220;A
man never has half so much fuss to unlock a door, if he has a key, as though he had not, and had
to cut it open with his jackknife</i>&#8221; (Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>,
[1972], 308).</p>
<p>With its 107 million cells, connected to the brain by over one million neurons, the eye is more
perfect than any camera ever invented. It caused Charles Darwin to humbly confess 
		<i>&#8220;that the eye
with all its inimitable controversies&#8230; could have been formed by natural selection seems, I
freely confess, absurd in the highest degree&#8221;</i> (Quoted in Bert Thompson, 
		<i>The Case for the
Existence of God</i> [2003]).</p>
<p>In 1860 Darwin wrote a botanist friend: <i>&#8220;To this day the eye makes me shudder&#8221; 
		</i>(Francis
Hitching, <i>Was Darwin Wrong?</i> Quoted in <i>The Neck of the Giraffe</i>). It is small wonder that a
much wiser race than Darwin&#8217;s, that of the ancient Egyptians, chose the eye as their symbol of
perfection.</p>
<p>The psalmist wrote: <i>&#8220;The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God&#8221;</i> (Psalms 53:1). Such a
foolish disbeliever ought use those precious eyes to look at his hands. Seventy muscles
contribute to hand movements. Much of the rest of the body is devoted to optimizing the
complex function of the hand. There are no muscles in the fingers. The sole purpose of the
forearm, its muscles and bones, is to move and optimally position the hand. </p>
<p>If you wish to observe a miracle, look at a baby&#8217;s creasy hand. Its initial movements are
uncontrolled. Shortly after birth it will be able to grasp, curl, push, lift, sense hot and cold,
respond to pain by withdrawal, heal itself, display great strength or extraordinary sensitivity.
These hands will be used thousands of times each day without aforethought. </p>
<p>Your miraculous thumb is controlled by 9 individual muscles and 3 major hand nerves. Sir Isaac
Newton said: <i>&#8220;In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God&#8217;s
existence&#8221; </i>(Paul Brand and Phillip Yancey, <i>The Scars fo Easter, Christianity Today</i> [April 5,
1985]. Paul Brand, renowned orthopedic hand surgeon, wrote: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We use our hands for the most wonderful activities: art, music, writing, healing,
touching. Some people go to concerts and athletic events to watch the
performance; I go to watch hands. For me, a piano performance is a ballet of
fingers &#8211; a glorious flourish of ligaments and joints, tendons, nerves and muscles
		</i>(Ibid).</p>
<p>Once the infant Son of Man possessed tiny hands. His hands, too, grew to accomplish their
intended purposes. He used them to touch and heal the blind and infirm. His hands threw the
money-changers out of the temple. His hands reached upward in prayer; outward in blessing; and
downward from the cross, penetrated by cruel nails, driven through the palms, then the wrists, by
the heavy blow of the mallet.</p>
<p>The fool proclaims in his heart that there is no god, but our eyes and our hands and our hearts
and souls unhesitatingly testify to the contrary. The psalmist wrote: <i>&#8220;I will praise thee; for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made&#8230;&#8221;</i> (Psalms 139:14).</p>
<p>One of my brothers is a physician. During earlier years in medical school he was assigned to
study anatomy in companionship with an agnostic. Their education eventually required that the
two of them carefully examine and dissect a cadaver. They studied the incredibly complex, yet
harmonious systems of the body: the lymphatic, skeletal, circulatory, waste elimination,
reproductive, neurological and immune systems. They noted the body&#8217;s power to correct its own
deficiencies, and to send healing antibodies to the place of injury or infection. They learned of
over 150 trillion cells within the body. If set end-to-end, they would encircle the earth over 200
times. Today they would learn of over one billion miles of DNA in one human body. They
learned of a brain bathed in fluid which continually receives signals from 130 million light
receptors in the eyes, 24,000 hearing receptors in the ears, 10,000 taste buds, and hundreds of
thousands of receptors in the skin, with specialized commission to recognize touch, vibration,
cold, heat and pain. My brother and his friend became silent as they contemplated the miracle
they were examining. Sensing the moment was right, my brother challenged: &#8220;Coincidence is a
marvelous thing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; The agnostic responded, &#8220;You win.&#8221;</p>
<p>This earth departs from its straight line orbit of the sun by only 1/9 of an inch every 18 miles. If,
instead, it changed by 1/10 of an inch every 18 miles we would all freeze to death. If it changed
by 1/8 of an inch we would all be incinerated? (Bert Thompson, <i>The Case for the Existence of
God</i> [2003]) Did this all happen by accident? </p>
<p>There are, perhaps, 25,000 billion billion (25 sextillion) stars in the one billion galaxies or Milky
Ways of which we have knowledge. Our own Milky Way has, perhaps, 100 billion stars. We
literally could not tally the stars of one galaxy within the span of a single life. In section 88 of
the Doctrine and Covenants the Prophet Joseph was taught the perfect order of this vast universe.<i>
&#8220;And there are many kingdoms;...And unto every kingdom is given a law;&#8230;and any man who
hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power&#8221;</i> (Doctrine
and Covenants 88:37-38, 47).</p>
<p>Alma spoke to us, as well as to Korihor, in testifying:<i> &#8220;</i>[Y]<i>ea, and all things denote there is a
God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and
also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme
Creator&#8221;</i> (Alma 30:44).</p>
<p>The doubter requires too much of us when he asks us to believe that the miracles of eyes and
hands and DNA and order in the universe all happened by chance. The passage of time, even
long intervals of time, is not a &#8220;cause&#8221; and provides no answers without an intelligent designer.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan, speaking in Moscow, Russia, during the Soviet period,
extemporaneously added to his remarks, <i>&#8220;Sometimes when I&#8217;m faced with an unbeliever, an
atheist, I am tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner one could ever serve and, when
finished eating that magnificent dinner, to ask him if he believes there&#8217;s a cook&#8221;</i> (Paul Kengor,
		<i>God and Ronald Reagan</i> [2004], 302).</p>
<p>You may be too young to remember the famous American trial of Alger Hiss, tried for treason
against the United States. The principal witness against him was Whitaker Chambers, a longtime
atheistic Communist, who finally could not escape the reality of God. He speaks of his
conversion in these words: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>My daughter was in her high chair. I was watching her eat. She was the most
miraculous thing that had ever happened in my life. &#8230;my eye came to rest on the
delicate convolutions of her ear &#8211; those intricate, perfect ears. The thought
passed through my mind: &#8220;No, those ears were not created by any chance coming
together of atoms in nature (the communist view). They could have been created
only by immense design.&#8221; The thought was involuntary and unwanted. I crowded
it out of my mind. But I never wholly forgot it or the occasion. I had to crowd it
out of my mind. If I had completed it, I should have had to say: Design
presupposes God. I did not then know that, at that moment, the finger of God was
first laid upon my forehead</i> (Whitaker Chambers, <i>Witness</i>, [1952] 16).</p>
<p>The evidence of God&#8217;s existence is everywhere: in every newborn babe, in every system, part
and parcel of the unending, and orderly universe, including our own bodies. He is evidenced in
every sunset, work of art and passage of music, all of which He has provided to gladden the heart
and bring beauty to our lives. Richard Swinburne said, <i>&#8220;God paints with a big brush from a
large paint box and he has no need to be stingy with the paint he uses to paint a beautiful
universe&#8221; </i>(Richard Swinburne, <i>Is There A God?</i> [1996] 63).</p>
<p>It is not possible to contemplate the immeasurable vacuum and purposelessness that would exist
in our lives if God were &#8220;not there.&#8221; A cloud or pallor of gloom would settle upon us of
indescribable proportion. We would regret the passing of every day, and the passing of every
loved one, knowing that neither time nor relationships could be extended. We would approach
the autumn, and then the winter years of life with crescendoing fear. Every day of our lives we
should thank God that He &#8220;is there&#8221; and that this life is not &#8220;all there is.&#8221; We call this the gift of
immortality. In the words of another, we are grateful that death is the &#8220;spreading of pinions to
soar,&#8221; not a &#8220;folding forever of wings&#8221; (<i>Ingersolls Lectures</i> [1877] 356). Because God exists we
rejoice in the unendingness of time.</p>
<p>Yet, some ask where God is because there is pain on this earth and God does not hasten to
intervene. This is known as the philosophical problem of evil. One flippantly approached this
issue by sophomorically suggesting that God ought to have made &#8220;good health catching rather
than disease&#8221; (<i>The Works of Robert G. Ingersoll</i>, Vol. 1 [1900] 11). However, such thinking
misses the whole point of our mortal existence, which is probationary rather than paradisiacal in
nature. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>During my years in law practice I became acquainted with a fine Jewish client. As a teenager he
lived as a Hasidic Jew in German-occupied France during the Second World War. He was
apprehended by the Gestapo. Tattooed numbers were placed on his arm labeling him as
undesirable and he was sent to a German concentration camp. He lived only because he was
young and strong, able to help with the required daily chores. As a result of his suffering he said
in his heart &#8220;there is no god.&#8221;</p>
<p>One day I asked him, for conversation sake, to imagine there is a god. &#8220;Would you have had this
god intervene and prevent the death of six million Jews during the Second World War?&#8221; I
inquired. He answered, &#8220;Most certainly.&#8221; </p>
<p>I then referred to others over the centuries, not necessarily of Jewish ancestry, who had also lost
their lives through barbarous acts. &#8220;Should God have intervened and stopped this?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he
affirmed.</p>
<p>I then spoke of yet others of ages past and present who died through cruel diseases, not the
inhumanity of man. &#8220;Should God have precluded this, also?&#8221; His avowal was consistent.</p>
<p>Then I spoke of yet others who, short of death, had suffered much from physical &#8211; or emotional &#8211;
or familial &#8211; or financial woes. My friend could not turn from his chosen course. He would have
God intervene and eliminate every burden of man. He was uncomfortable in his answer but did
not know where to draw the line once his imaginary god hastened to remove the very challenges
that are the purpose and necessity of our probationary estate. I told him I did not like his god,
even if only imaginary, for he kept me from passing the tests of faith for which I was sent to this
earth. </p>
<p>In his marvelous message entitled <i>Tragedy or Destiny?</i> President Spencer W. Kimball
rhetorically inquires what disservice we would offer to God&#8217;s plan, if we had uncontrolled
power, yet limited vision. He wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>With such uncontrolled power, I surely would have felt to protect Christ from the
agony in Gethsemane, the insults, the thorny crown, the indignities in the court,
the physical injuries. I would have administered to his wounds and healed them,
giving him cooling water instead of vinegar. I might have saved him from
suffering and death, and lost to the world his atoning sacrifice</i> (Spencer W.
Kimball, <i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>, [1972] 99).</p>
<p>If little babies could talk, and could remember their pre-earthly estate, their first utterances might
express, &#8220;You came here to be tested. You agreed to that. The tests will be hard, in part because
they are seldom the tests you anticipated. This is a closed book test in that you will not
remember your pre-mortal estate. God will not intervene and remove the tests until the close of
the examination or probationary period.&#8221; That God does not hasten to intervene does not mean
He is not there or does not love us. He has infinite respect for our agency and the purposes of
earth life. </p>
<p>Elder Melvin J. Ballard stirs us with this example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I remember a good sister out in the Northwest whose husband was stricken with
paralysis until he was unable to move, and lay day after day in the hospital. She
said, &#8220;He can&#8217;t die. He must not die or my faith will be broken.&#8221; God knows how
much we can stand and He recognizes this. I said to that woman, &#8220;God will not
take your husband until you ask Him to: She said, &#8220;I will never ask Him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The man became so weak he could only speak in the slightest whisper. One day,
months having passed, the woman came to the mission office and said, &#8220;I never
thought I would live to reach the place I am today. You told me he would never be
taken until the Lord was asked to take him. I come now seeking his death. Please
come and ask the Lord to take him. I surrender him and give him up. I can&#8217;t
endure his suffering longer.&#8221; We went to the hospital and asked the Lord for that
blessing, and in one hour he was gone </i>(Melvin R. Ballard,<i> Melvin J. Ballard,
Crusader of Righteousness</i> [1966] 278).</p>
<p>Agency is not just the right to select among good alternatives. When God granted agency, He
necessarily contemplated the possibility of wrong choices. Because God knows best and esteems
so highly our precious agency, He does not answer every prayer just as it is uttered, nor does He
always punish transgressors before there has been an opportunity or a space for repentance. The
Divine hesitancy is to our advantage. </p>
<p>The same God who brings such order to the universe, and inspired the prophets, designated the
time, place and circumstances of your birth. He chose your ancestors and your posterity. To the
Prophet Joseph the Lord said, <i>&#8220;Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less&#8230;&#8221;</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 122:9). God&#8217;s love for you and awareness of your circumstances is of
equal measure. He foreordained you to perform a mission. Nothing will bring you greater sorrow
than to have Father say when you return home: &#8220;You didn&#8217;t complete your work. I had to give
part of your mission to someone else.&#8221; </p>
<p>You satisfy only part of your obligation to God by acknowledging the order of His universe. You
must do more than confess His existence. Our relationship with God is not that of Creator and
created-thing. It is of personal Father and child.</p>
<p>In March of 1997, I had the privilege of being present when President Hinckley was interviewed
by the 17 senior editors of the Los Angeles Times. An editor inquired as to the rapid growth of
the Church. President Hinckley chose to respond, instead, by emphasizing the miraculous
transformation in life of each individual who joins the Church. He spoke of a girl in Australia
who was employed serving ice cream. She seemed inattentive to the message of the missionaries
until one of them said, &#8220;Do you know that you are a child of God?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Nobody has
ever said that to me before. I had no idea that I might be a child of God.&#8221; Thereafter she went to
her room, got down on her knees, and inquired, &#8220;Are you there? Am I your child? Please let me
know.&#8221; Then she said, &#8220;There came into me a surge of feeling that brought me the conviction
that was the case.&#8221; She joined the Church.</p>
<p>Two weeks later she was asked to give a talk in a Church meeting. Her first impulse was to run
from it. Then she thought, &#8220;If I am a child of God I can do anything.&#8221; With this enlarged vision
of who she was she became a stalwart member of the Church.</p>
<p>Our entire perspective of ourselves, our worth and what we can make of our lives is altered for
good when we come to understand that we are God&#8217;s children, and we can become like Him.
Everything we know and understand about God and our relationship with Him is a result of the
Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration. </p>
<p>Someday, when memory is refreshed and all things are drawn <i>&#8220;to 
		</i>[our] <i>remembrance&#8221;</i> (John
14:26) we will recall what we did and knew in the glorious pre-mortal estate. Undoubtedly we
understood there the foundation principles of the gospel. President Joseph F. Smith said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Can we know anything here that we did not know before we came? [Christ] no
doubt possessed a foreknowledge of all the vicissitudes through which he would
have to pass in the mortal tabernacle&#8230;He is our example. If Christ knew
beforehand, so did we. But in coming here, we forgot all, that our agency might
be free indeed, to choose good or evil</i> (Joseph F. Smith, <i>Gospel Doctrine</i> [1970]
13).</p>
<p>We may have prayed countless times that when we found the truth on this earth &#8211; or it found us &#8211;
we would not be casual in living our religion. We must have urged that we would, in the fullest
measure, complete the mission to which we were foreordained, that our work would not be given
to others. Perhaps we prayed a thousand times ten thousand times that on this earth we would
never lose our faith or virtue, or our ability to remain as living tools in the hands of the Lord in
accomplishing His work. It would serve us well if our present prayers included the same
supplications. Every morning and night we should plead with the Lord on our knees that we
never lose our faith or virtue.</p>
<p>The Book of Daniel includes the remarkable story of the three princes of Judah: Shadrach,
Meshach and Abed-nego. They were cast into the midst of a burning, fiery furnace, heated seven
times more than it was wont to be heated, because they would only worship the true and living
God.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Did not we cast three men, bound into the midst of the fire?</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">[L]<i>o, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt;
and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The king&#8217;s counselors</i> [then] 
		<i>saw these men, &#8230;upon whose bodies the fire had no
power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor
the smell of fire had passed on them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach
and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in
him, and have changed the king&#8217;s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might
not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</i> (Daniel 3:24-25, 27-29)</p>
<p>Thereby all learned that our God is God.</p>
<p>This is the true answer to the query of the young lad in Moscow, who asked: &#8220;Where is God?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the promises of God resting upon you are conditional. They are dependent upon
individual covenant-keeping and fulfillment of your appointed mission as a child of God in the
exercise of your agency.</p>
<p>But the promises of God resting upon this Church, and its appointed destiny are unconditional.
When Peter and John stood before the Sanhedrin and boldly testified in the name of Christ,
Gamaliel said to his fellow Sanhedrists in reference to the missions of Peter and John: 
		<i>&#8220;Refrain
from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to
naught: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against
God&#8221;</i> (Acts 5:38-39).</p>
<p>I have a testimony that this is true. I know that our God is God, and that He lives. I know He is
our personal Father with an appointed mission for each of us to perform. I pray that we will
never lose our faith, testimonies or virtue, that we may be worthy to receive the blessings of
immortality and eternal life, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am extremely humbled by this privilege and opportunity.  In Proverbs it is taught, 
		<i>&#8220;Whoso
keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles&#8221; </i>(Proverbs 21:23).  I always
have not said the right things in the right moment.  I remember too well a time when we were
visiting with some friends and I observed the wife had that certain roundness of the tummy that
reflected pregnancy.  I mistakenly asked the wrong question; I asked when she was due.  She
frankly told me that she was not pregnant.  Then trying to recover, I then said something like, Oh
you must of just gave birth.  She then explained that it had been several years past. So it is my
personal prayer that my tongue be loosed and tame, that it may speak the Word of God, and as
pronounced by the Psalmist, <i>&#8220;The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my
tongue&#8221;</i> (2 Samuel 23:2).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the
Lord&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 2:10).  As we have a great opportunity to be at this inspired institution, I offer a
similar invitation, O that we might like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in
becoming disciples of the Lord, Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Why this valley?  I think that we get quite a bad rap in Rexburg, or Iceburg as it sometimes
referred to, as we approach the winter months.  A former Student Life Vice President, Mack
Shirley, annually joked about Rexburg in his welcoming address to new Freshmen, with
pronouncements of: &#8220;Welcome to Rexburg, where we have two seasons in a year, Winter and
July,&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s the only place where you ski 10 months a year - the other two are too cold.&#8221;  For
those who come from the wooded and lush areas, Rexburg may appear to be somewhat of a little
city planted in the desert.  However, I firmly believe that this area is a choice place, one
consecrated for a distinct purpose, and growing line upon line, precept upon precept, into
fruition. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />I am grateful to witness and be a part of the fulfilling of this great prophecy, as many students
have gone into and blessed the world. However, simply being accepted and coming to BYU-Idaho does not comprise the fulfillment, just as simply standing on the court of a NBA franchise
does not make one a professional basketball player.  Becoming steadfast and immovable is a
process, not an event.  We are each here for a distinct purpose, aptly described in the mission
statement of this University, and individually tailored by the Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, this is a dedicated institution of the Lord. Seize the moment, and capture
the opportunity that you have.  Pray to understand why you are here, and you will then be given
the preparatory opportunities and privileges that are yours.  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />What was lost during those first years at Ricks will never be regained, other than a lesson taught
to seize the moments of privilege and opportunity, for we can never realize the magnitude of
opportunities while they are seeds, only after they are planted, watered, and nurtured by faith and
works.  Perhaps part of my repentance requires a payment of counsel and advice to you this day. 
My desire is that not one of you cheat yourself, as did I.  Brothers and Sisters, if we do not
become like unto the strength of this valley, the Spirit of Ricks, it&#8217;s firmness, steadfastness and
immovable nature, we will live below our privilege of being placed here by the hand of the Lord. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In becoming steadfast and immovable, I will focus on the following key principles of
steadfastness:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">1.  We must be fastened to Christ</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">2.  We must move to be immovable.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">3.  Steadfastness requires full-time application.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">1.  We must be fastened to Christ.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Your experience here at BYU-Idaho is centered on the principle that you leave here prepared to
become a steadfast and immovable disciple of Jesus Christ.  Elder David A. Bednar referred to
this institution as a DPC, Disciple Preparation Center.  This requires the center of your life to be
built upon Him, of whom you covenant weekly to remember always, stating your willingness to
take upon yourself His holy name, promising to always keep His commandments.
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What is required to be steadfast in Christ?</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />So they heard and felt, but they did not understand, even a second time they did hear again, but
they understood not. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But the third time, note what they did: <i>&#8220;&#8230;open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards
the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.&#8221; 
		</i>The result, <i>&#8220;the third time they did understand the voice which they heard&#8221; 
		</i>(3 Nephi 11:3,5,6). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fastening ourselves to Christ requires us to look steadfastly upon Him, which brings about the
consequential blessings of understanding.  Looking steadfastly upon him requires acceptance of
His invitations to <i>&#8220;come unto me,&#8221; &#8220;take my yoke upon you,&#8221; &#8220;learn of me&#8221;</i> (Matthew 11:28-29), and, 
		<i>&#8220;I would that ye should be perfect even as I am&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 12:48).  We must look
beyond the world to see what He sees in us.  For the world or Satan would otherwise cheat us
from becoming even as he is (3 Nephi 27:27).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">My friend, Corwin Sutherin, was a pole vaulter in high school.  He had never achieved a height
beyond the 12-foot mark.  Not in a meet, nor in practice.  One day in practice after several failed
attempts at 11 feet, 11 inches, his coach told him he was lowering the standard to 11 feet 6
inches.  Knowing his ability to clear this height, Corwin easily cleared the adjusted bar.  His
coach then called him over, and asked him to look at the measurement.  It was set at 12 feet six
inches.  By his coach setting the standard, higher than Corwin&#8217;s own expectation for himself, he
achieved a level beyond his expectation.  Corwin went on to surpass that level by another foot,
earning a meet championship.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our Eternal Coach, knows what heights we can become, even as He is, has sent His beloved Son,
so that we might <i>&#8220;look forward with steadfastness unto Christ&#8221; 
		</i>(2 Nephi 25:24).  We must then
fasten ourselves to Him by becoming like Him.  We do this by learning of Him, so that we can
always think as He thinks, speak as He speaks, and act as He acts.  So often we try to find
ourselves thinking that establishing our individuality is the prize of this life&#8217;s quest. In my early
career involved in mental health, I often heard of people stating their struggles to find
themselves.  They sought to become different than everyone else by their fashions, philosophies,
and actions.  This is a message of the world, but Christ&#8217;s message is for each of us to become<i>
&#8220;even as I am&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 27:27).  This process is dependent upon the First Principle of the
Gospel, to have <i>&#8220;faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ&#8221;</i> (Fourth Article of Faith), 
		<i>&#8220;having a perfect
brightness of hope&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 31:20).   When we really understand why we are here, any trial and
affliction is more easily resolved, knowing that life is but a moment in eternity, seeing things
through the <i>&#8220;lens of eternity&#8221;</i> (President James E. Faust, General Relief Society Meeting,
October, 2005).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />After listening for a bit, I turned to the young man and read this quote from Elder Bednar:<i> &#8220;I am
convinced that students violate the honor and dress codes for two and only two reasons: (1) they
either do not understand the codes, or (2) they choose to willfully rebel&#8221;</i>  (Elder David A.
Bednar, Devotional, September 1, 1998).  I offered a question: Is it possible that you do not
understand, or are you in a state of open rebellion?  I asked if he understood why the Brethren
have made statements about piercings.  He replied that he did not understand.  We then reviewed
the statement from the Strength of Youth, and also scriptural reference of our body being a
temple of God.  Statements and scriptures that he had heard, but did not understand. Like unto
the American inhabitants that we just read of, he needed to look steadfastly upon Christ for full
understanding to occur. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I then asked him if he were a missionary, would he wear the piecing.  He said no.  I asked why
not.  He then had a great revelation and understanding come about as he replied, &#8220;Because I
would be representing the Lord.&#8221;  When he looked steadfastly to the Lord, and realized his desire
to be fastened to Him, he understood.  We concluded with our acknowledgment that we are
always representing the Lord by the fact that we have taken upon us a covenant that we are
willing to take upon us His name and always remember Him by keeping His commandments. 
This time when this young man departed from my office, I knew I would not see him again
because he humbled himself, turned to the Lord, and his natural man weakness had become a
strength.  However, I did see this young man once more, many months after&#8230;but this time it
was not with a letter from the Testing Center, but a letter from the Prophet, calling him to serve
as the Lord&#8217;s servant. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fastening ourselves to Christ requires a constant analysis of comparing our thoughts, words, and
actions with the standard of what the Savior would think, say, and do.  And each week, the
Sacrament Table becomes our weekly meet to measure our progress with the standard our
Eternal Father has set and renew again our covenants.  It requires us to pray always, lest we be
deceived.  It requires us to acknowledge the Lord in all of our doings.  </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">2.  We must move to become immovable.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I don&#8217;t think that the state of being steadfast and immovable infers to a stable state. Becoming
such requires steadiness in commitment, and we must have a continuous movement from our
natural man characters towards those immovable traits of our Elder Brother.  Nephi counsels us
in 2 Nephi 31, <i>&#8220;Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi
31:20). One cannot press forward without movement.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Bednar taught regarding this principle at the recent General Priesthood meeting:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>In our customary Church vocabulary, we often speak of going to church, going to
the temple, and going on a mission. Let me be so bold as to suggest that our
rather routine emphasis on going misses the mark.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>The issue is not going to church; rather, the issue is worshiping and renewing
covenants as we attend church. The issue is not going to or through the temple;
rather, the issue is having in our hearts the spirit, the covenants, and the
ordinances of the Lord's house. The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the
issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of
our heart, might, mind, and strength. It is possible for a young man to go on a
mission and not become a missionary, and this is not what the Lord requires or
what the Church needs</i> (Elder David A. Bednar, General Priesthood Meeting,
October, 2005).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In this same manner, you may be going to BYU-Idaho, but a deeper question resides, &#8220;What are
you becoming?&#8221;  While you are in this valley, it is critical to discover what makes it firm,
steadfast, and immovable, so that you can become like unto it in your discipleship of Jesus
Christ, This indeed is invaluable, and the greatest prize of the privilege of being here.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />Movement is not a comfortable, nor easy process.  The Lord knew of our natural man tendencies
and requires us to become as <i>&#8220;a </i>[little]<i> child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love,
willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth
submit to his father&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 3:19).  This movement is contrary to the world perception of
maturity.  While the world measures maturity in degrees of independence, the Lord requires us to
move to an understanding of our dependence on the Lord and to act accordingly.  Like the
student in my class, we must be submissive, seeking the Lord&#8217;s will in all we do.
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I started my first job following Graduate School, I was hired as a caseworker at the Youth
Services Center in St. Anthony, Idaho, which served as the State institution for incarcerated
delinquents.  I was assigned to work at the cottage which housed the older youth on the campus. 
When introducing me to the inmates, the psychologist pronounced, &#8220;This is Mr. Miyasaki. He
has a black belt in karate, so no one mess with him.&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t quite know how to respond, so I
didn&#8217;t and the legend began.  By the way, the only black belt I had was used to hold my pants up. 
However, rumors flew, and I quite enjoyed the instant respect and fear.  Then one night I was
called to come in as there was a fight in the dorm.  We decided that we needed to place one of
the boys in lock-up until the situation cooled down.  As I escorting this young man to the lock up
room, we first entered a small locked cubicle that was a safety area between the hallway and the
lock up room, with just barely enough room to have two people standing together.  In these
crowded quarters this young man challenged, &#8220;Okay, Mr. Miyasaki, let&#8217;s see what you got. It&#8217;s
just you and me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In contrast with my dependence upon a faulty image, again, the Savior has shown the perfect
example of being steadfast and immovable in those situations that were most trying,  For in his
life despite the world judging him to be a thing of naught; <i>&#8220;&#8230;wherefore they scourge him, and
he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth
it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi
19:9).  The Savior never faltered or relied upon worldly measures of power and strength in the
end of his mortal existence, for He knew who He was and was steadfast and immovable, as His
will had moved to be swallowed in the will of His Father&#8217;s.  So it is the task of each of us to
move to that same state.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">King Benjamin declared to his people: <i>&#8220;Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and
immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal
you his&#8230;&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 5:15)</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">King Benjamin clearly teaches that being steadfast and immovable is full-time, always
abounding in good works.  Always being a key word.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Steadfastness is not a process of latching on and off dependent upon circumstances and
conveniences, but a full-time adherence to the gospel.  Elder Henry B. Eyring taught at the
recent General Conference, <i>&#8220;So the great test of life is to see whether we will hearken to and
obey God's commands in the midst of the storms of life. It is not to endure storms, but to choose
the right while they rage. And the tragedy of life is to fail in that test and so fail to qualify to
return in glory to our heavenly home.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Now pay special attention to Elder Eyring&#8217;s next counsel:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>However much faith to obey God we now have, we will need to strengthen it
continually and keep it refreshed constantly. We can do that by deciding now to
be more quick to obey and more determined to endure. Learning to start early
and to be steady are the keys to spiritual preparation. Procrastination and
inconsistency are its mortal enemies</i> (Elder Henry B. Eyring, General
Conference, October 2005).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The words &#8220;continually&#8221; and &#8220;constantly&#8221; reflect the full-time nature of a steadfast and firm
disciple of Christ.  What better preparation for future storms does one have than by living the
standards of the Honor Code.  In interviewing a young man who was preparing to go to the
temple for eternal marriage, I asked him if he was morally clean in every aspect with prospective
bride.  He confidently pronounced, &#8220;We are clean.&#8221;  I asked him how he maintained his
cleanliness.  He stated, &#8220;If you just keep the Honor Code and live by its standards, you can never
be in a situation of being in violation with the Lord&#8217;s Code.&#8221;  
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A part-time application of being steadfast is aptly described in this Cowboy poem by Waddie
Mitchell:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Our will is what Elder Neal A. Maxwell pronounced as the only thing that is uniquely ours that
we can offer as a sacrifice to the Lord.  So our will, our desires should be continually consistent
with His will.  We always demonstrate our agency.   President James E Faust taught, 
		<i>&#8220;We cannot
hide what we are, try as we will. It shines from within us. We are transparent. When we attempt
to deceive, we deceive only ourselves. We are like the emperor in the fairy tale who was deceived
into thinking he was arrayed in beautiful garments, but he was in fact unclothed&#8221; 
		</i>(President
James E. Faust, Ensign Feb, 1982).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of my all time favorite quotes comes from the wise Star Wars character Yoda.  When young
Luke Skywalker is struggling in an attempt to raise the star ship from the marsh, he states in a
voice of self-doubt, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; to which Yoda responds, &#8220;Do or do not - there is not try.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">The blessing of steadfastness</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and Sisters, steadfastness is not just a catch word to incite momentary attention, but an
eternal principle with eternal consequences and blessings. Nephi testifies that steadfastness will
result in the declaration <i>&#8220;ye shall have eternal life&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 31:20).  Nephi further teaches that
notwithstanding all persecution <i>"behold, they are they which shall not perish.  But the Son of
righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with
him&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 26:8-9).  The Lamanite prophet Samuel taught a great blessing of being firm and
steadfast is freedom (Helaman 15:8).  The great gift of redemption is a result of steadfastness as
testified by Alma: <i>&#8220;It is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every
man who steadfastly believeth on his name&#8221;</i> (Alma 5:48).  And the Lord declared, 
		<i>&#8220;For even yet
the kingdom is yours, and shall be forever, if you fall not from your steadfastness. Even so.
Amen"</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 82:).  The Savior again pronounced, <i>&#8220;He that remaineth
steadfast and is not overcome, the same shall be saved&#8221;</i> (Joseph Smith-Matthew 1:11).</font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000080"><br /></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters it is a delight to be with you in this devotional today.  May I first comment
on a few things I think make BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho is a unique school. You have wonderful physical
facilities and programs and activities, wards and stakes and soon you will have a temple. The
faculty members are men and women of academic competence but also, men and women of
faith. You have a wonderful new president. He is a bright, highly accomplished man with
tremendous experience and respect in the academic and business community. I am quite certain,
however, he was not chosen as the president of this university just because he was Dean of the
Harvard Business College and a man with tremendous experience and intellectual ability. He is a
man who is obedient to the promptings of the spirit in his own life and also responsive to a
unique invitation by an inspired prophet.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You are a unique student body. How many of you are returned missionaries, married, from
outside the state of Idaho, from outside the U.S.? How many of you are converts or the only
active member in your family? For me the uniqueness of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho is not found just in the
quality of the faculty and administration, the physical facilities, programs and the student body,
but also in the purpose of this institution. In a devotional address in 2004, Elder Bednar (then
President Bednar) referred to BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho as a DPC, a &#8220;disciple preparation center.&#8221; What a
blessing it is to be able to study in this unique institution where one can seek knowledge by
study, and also by faith and really strive to become a disciple of Christ. Take full advantage of
this unique opportunity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we left our home in heaven and came to earth, a veil was drawn making it difficult to
remember what it was like living with Heavenly Father. We came to earth without a recollection
of why we are here or who we really are. We received this wonderful physical body which we so
much desired as we anticipated our turn to come to earth. We are learning to care for this body,
to use it, to discipline it, and to benefit from it. We are in the process of learning who we are and
why we are here, gaining mortal experience and striving to keep the commandments.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the premortal council Satan rebelled against Father and His plan. Here in mortality he
continues his unrelenting efforts to tempt us, confuse us, discourage us and ultimately destroy us.
We live in a wonderful and exciting time in the history of the world. It is also a challenging time.
This line from Charles Dickens, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, describes our day: &#8220;It was the best of
times.&#8221; And it truly is. There are more temples, more missionaries, more tithe-payers, more
members of the Church, more faith and kindness and more service. But it is also &#8220;the worst of
times&#8221;: abortion, abuse, terrorism, pornography, murder, dishonesty, corruption, tyranny and
devastating natural disasters are common place. It is a day of great prosperity, but also a day of
crippling poverty. An era of an unprecedented information explosion, but also a day when
intellectualism, prosperity, pride and vanity often supplant faith in God. It is a time when many
have a difficult time distinguishing between truth and error.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our day was seen by many ancient and modern prophets. On Christmas Day of 1832 the Lord
revealed to the Prophet Joseph what we now call the Civil War and the beginning of the blood
shed, plagues, earthquakes, and difficulties which would come upon the world from that time
forward. Two days later the Prophet received Doctrine and Covenants 88, the Lord&#8217;s message of
peace, wherein the Lord instructed the saints to learn <i>&#8220;of things both in heaven and in the earth
and under the earth, things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come
to pass, things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the
nations&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:79).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The curriculum of this university provides opportunity for you to study all of these things. Do
you think the Lord asks us to learn these things just to get a degree or prepare for a career? These
are important reasons, but in verse 80 the Lord told the early saints they should also learn these
things <i>&#8220;that ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling
whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine
and Covenants 88:80). President Clark&#8217;s appointment to be president of this university and Elder
Bednar&#8217;s call to serve as an Apostle are great examples of men who studied and prepared
themselves and were ready and willing to respond to a call when I came. As you study and learn,
you too should be preparing to serve wherever and however you are asked.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are additional reasons why we should seek knowledge and truth in this life. Doctrine and
Covenants 93:36 says, <i>&#8220;the glory of god is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.&#8221;</i>
Verse 37 adds<i> &#8220;light and truth forsake that evil one&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36-37). Thus
gaining light and truth help us not only to become like God but also to resist Satan. Doctrine and
Covenants 130:18-19 adds this: <i>&#8220;Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it
will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in
this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage
in the world to come.&#8221; </i>Gaining light and truth is therefore not just something we do for
mortality.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As I reflect on my own academic studies, including my doctoral work, one of the most important
things I learned was how to study and how to learn. I don&#8217;t remember all the facts I learned from
the classes, but I began to learn how to study and learn and that has served me well. So as you
prepare for tests and strive to complete a degree, make sure you learn how to learn and not cut
corners just to get a grade or to get through.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">New knowledge can bring new blessings. Things that previously seemed impossible become
commonplace. Who would have thought we could have airplanes carrying hundreds of people in
comfort across the ocean, computers that store, access and manipulate whole libraries of books
from a microchip, or men orbiting the earth. All these are possible because the Lord revealed
truth and understanding to people who sought knowledge by diligent study and also by faith.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Packer explains an important difference between learning physical truth and spiritual
truth:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Knowledge of the physical universe and of the laws which govern it is cumulative.
Thus each generation builds upon and expands the knowledge gained from
discoveries of the past. Contributions to scientific and practical knowledge are
gathered from one generation to the next. As greater light and knowledge are
discovered, tentative theories of the past are replaced.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What does that mean? It means we don&#8217;t have to rediscover electricity or reinvent the computer
every generation. That type of knowledge is cumulative and is passed from one generation to the
next.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">President Packer then adds,</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Unlike knowledge of the physical universe, the moral knowledge of each
generation begins where the previous began rather than where they left off. For
example, the remedy for an infection in the physical body has changed
dramatically over the centuries; the remedy for infidelity, not at all. Morality is
not so easily conveyed from one generation to the next</i> (President Boyd K.
Packer, &#8220;The Law and the Light&#8221;).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The cumulative knowledge of the physical universe that man has gathered over decades is
available to you through the course work offered here. The process for acquiring spiritual
knowledge, however, is individual and has not changed since the beginning of mortality.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As we read in Doctrine and Covenants 93:38, <i>&#8220;every spirit of man was innocent in the
beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state,
innocent before God.&#8221; </i>So each of us from an infant, innocent state, must come to know for
ourselves that we are children of a loving Heavenly Father, that there is a Savior and that by faith
and obedience we can return to their presence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I share, as best I can recall it, an experience I had several years ago. I was teaching a large
institute class during the hippy era. One evening, partway through the class, a student, whom I
knew but who had not attended class before, walked in. I was surprised to see her. She had with
her a young man. The young man came wearing a pair of bib overalls, no shirt, no shoes and had
long, unkempt hair. The two sat down in the back of the room and the minute class was over they
were gone. I thought that was probably the last I would see of her for awhile and I would
probably never see him again. To my surprise they attended the next few classes. In one
particular class the lesson was on prayer. As you know it can be intimidating to be called on to
pray at the end of a lesson on prayer. You want to say it just right. As we were about to conclude
the lesson I felt I should call upon this young man to pray and I thought, &#8220;that is crazy.&#8221; But the
impression was there and so without the courage to even look at the young man, I announced
that he would give the closing prayer. To my surprise, he stood. I cannot duplicate his prayer nor
should I try, but I would like to give you a feel, from my perception, of what happened. He
closed his eyes and said something like this, &#8220;God, I guess that&#8217;s your name, this is strange, I&#8217;m
not even sure you are there, but I hope you are, I would like to believe you are. I&#8217;m not quite sure
what all this is about. You know I&#8217;ve been lost and confused and I really do not understand much
about life. I have felt something really different and wonderful here and I would like to know if
you are really there and if I really am your son. Is it possible for you to let me know that?&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I don&#8217;t need to tell you there wasn&#8217;t a dry eye in the class. I don&#8217;t know that I had ever heard
anyone talk to God as openly and honestly as this young man did. It wasn&#8217;t very long before he
had a testimony and asked to be baptized. At his baptism he bore his testimony. It wasn&#8217;t an
eloquent testimony in terms of the words or the length. He simply said something like, &#8220;I know
there is a God, I know He loves me, I have never been happier and I am excited to be baptized.&#8221; 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A couple of weeks later as I was walking down the hallway of the Church on a Sunday morning,
I could see this young man coming toward me. He was wearing a dress coat, a shirt, tie, (none of
which matched very well) and had a missionary type hair cut. He came running up to me and
said, &#8220;Today is one of the most exciting days of my life. Do you know why?&#8221; I said &#8220;No, tell
me.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Today I am going to get the priesthood. Brother Moore, do I look like a
priesthood man?&#8221; Despite the mismatched clothes, he looked like a priesthood man to me. The
spiritual knowledge this young man had come to know completely changed him and the
direction of his life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Satan does not want us to understand truth either physical or spiritual. He undoubtedly delights
when we get caught up in intellectualism, or accept for truth the philosophies of men or half-truths mixed with scripture. He rejoices when he can keep us from knowing God and knowing
our divine potential. Doctrine and Covenants 93:39 cautions each of us <i>&#8220;that wicked one 
		</i>[Satan]
<i>cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and
because of the tradition of their fathers.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord has not left us alone in battling Satan. He has given us a wonderful gift to assist us.
Doctrine and Covenants 121:26 says,<i> &#8220;God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit,
yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was
until now.&#8221; </i>He then promises us</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>a time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set
forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land,
or to the sun, moon or stars&#8212;All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed
days, months and years, and all the days of their days, months and years, and all
their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation
of the fullness of times</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 121:28-31).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The tremendous progress in technology, the information explosion and the increased
understanding of the universe in our day, are but an indication of what God said he would reveal
through the &#8220;unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Moroni 10:5 teaches us that <i>&#8220;by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all
things.&#8221; </i>Does that really mean all things? I think it does. Elder Dallin H. Oaks, quoting Brigham
Young, said, <i>&#8220;Every discovery in science and art, that is really true and useful to mankind, has
been given by direct revelation from God&#8221; </i>(Deseret News, 22 Oct. 1862, 129, as quoted by
Dallin H. Oaks, Ensign, May 2001, 83).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder LeGrand Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve said,
		<i>&#8220;To me the gift of the Holy Ghost is
as important to man as sunshine and water are to plants&#8221;</i> (LeGrand Richards, in Conference
Report, Oct. 1979, 109; or Ensign, Nov. 1979, 76). Elder Robert D. Hales adds the
		<i>&#8220;constant
companionship </i>[of the Holy Ghost] <i>is among the greatest gifts we can receive in mortality, for
by the light of His promptings and His cleansing power, we can be led back into the presence of
God&#8221;</i> (Robert D. Hales, &#8220;Out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light, Ensign, May 2002).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Is knowing truth by the Holy Ghost really that sure? President James E. Faust indicates 
		<i>&#8220;a
spiritual confirmation by the power of the Holy Ghost, &#8230; is more powerful than all the senses
combined&#8221;</i> (James E. Faust, &#8220;Lord, I Believe; Help Thou Mine Unbelief.&#8221; Ensign, November
2003). In fact, President Joseph Fielding Smith bears this witness, <i>&#8220;The testimony of the Holy
Ghost is the strongest testimony that a man can receive. The testimony of the Spirit is so great,
and the impressions and revelations of divine truth so forcefully revealed that there comes to the
recipient a conviction of the truth that he cannot forget&#8221;</i> (Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to
Gospel Questions, 4:92).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">After baptism, those holding the priesthood place their hands upon a person&#8217;s head and the
individual is told, &#8220;Receive the Holy Ghost.&#8221; It is interesting to me that he doesn&#8217;t say to the
Holy Ghost, &#8220;enter into this man,&#8221; but rather the responsibility to receive the Holy Ghost is given
to the individual. In Doctrine and Covenants130 we are taught that even after we are given the
gift, the Holy Ghost may descend upon us but not tarry with us. If an individual fails to be
obedient to the light and truth he has received, he can lose the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
Mercifully if the individual repents and in humility seeks forgiveness the companionship of the
Holy Ghost is restored. Each of us must learn to use this unspeakable gift for ourselves.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I was a mission president new missionaries often asked me, &#8220;President, what kind of
music can we listen to in this mission?&#8221; &#8220;President, can I put this big beautiful picture of my
girlfriend in my apartment so I can have it by my bed and where I study?&#8221; My response was,
&#8220;Elder, I am not going to answer those questions, but I would like to read a scripture and see if
together we can understand a principle that will help you answer the questions for yourself.&#8221; We
would then turn to Doctrine and Covenants 64:34: <i>&#8220;Behold the Lord requireth the heart and a
willing mind.&#8221; </i>Then I would ask, &#8220;Elder, why do you think the Lord requires the heart and a
willing mind? Why doesn&#8217;t the Lord ask for a kidney, or an elbow?&#8221; If it was a sister I would
often ask, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you be just delighted to receive a valentine&#8217;s card with a big beautiful
kidney on the front, saying I love you?&#8221; What is it about the heart and the mind and did you
notice that the Lord placed a qualifier in referring to the mind? He wants a willing mind. Why?
We would then turn to Doctrine and Covenants 8:2-3 and talk about the role of the heart and
mind in receiving inspiration from the Holy Ghost: <i>&#8220;Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and
in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your
heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#8220;Why does the Lord want your heart and mind, Elder?&#8221; Together we would agree that through
the Holy Ghost the Lord can reveal light and truth to him and guide him as a missionary. &#8220;What
does that have to do with the kind of music you listen to or what you think about like the picture
of your girlfriend? I can almost guarantee, Elder, if you listen to music that reminds you of home
or immerses you in the world, the inspiration you need probably won&#8217;t be there. Or if you spend
a lot of time looking at that picture and in your heart you long to be back with that beautiful girl,
or playing on the athletic team that you left when you came on your mission, you&#8217;ll probably be
unhappy and not be a very effective missionary. You can choose to make it easier or harder on
yourself by the type of music you listen to, and the things you think about which are foreign to
your assignment as a missionary. That choice is up to you. I&#8217;m here to help, but I would like you
to learn how to do that on your own, so that when you are not in the mission and nobody is
setting the rules for you, you will know how to keep your mind and heart open to receive needed
inspiration.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&#8220;Elder, remember &#8216;many [are] called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?
Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of
men.&#8217;&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the blessings of this unique university is that you have an honor code including dress
standards. You have faculty and fellow students that can assist you in keeping your mind and
heart out of the &#8220;things of this world.&#8221; Here the Lord can teach you not only truths about this
physical world, but especially the truths of the spiritual world.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I worry not only about the type of music that is listened to, but the constancy of the noise and the
almost insatiable desire for entertainment that exists today. All of us have driven by a car with
the music turned up so loud (even if it were the Tabernacle Choir, which it obviously is not) we
couldn&#8217;t get the driver&#8217;s attention if we yelled at the top of our voice. How can the still small
voice of the Holy Ghost communicate when our minds are not free to listen? Doctrine and
Covenants 76 warns us that Satan <i>&#8220;maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them
round about.&#8221; </i>Satan will do anything to make it so our mind and heart are not receptive to the
Holy Ghost. President Packer gave a great insight of a tactic used in warfare when he said, 
		<i>&#8220;The
first order issued by a commander mounting a military invasion is the jamming of the channels
of communication of those he intends to conquer. Irreverence suits the purposes of the adversary
by obstructing the delicate channels of revelation in both mind and spirit&#8221;</i> (President Boyd K.
Packer, &#8220;Reverence Invites Revelation&#8221; Ensign, Nov. 1991). </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Is it any wonder that Satan has unleashed a tsunamic flood of noise and evil to try to &#8220;jam&#8221; our
communication channels from the Holy Ghost? You have decisions of eternal consequences to
make important decisions like: should I go on a mission? whom should I marry? what should I
study? and should we have children while we are trying to get through school? Keep your mind
willing and your heart open to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the answers will come clear
and strong.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Doctrine in Covenants 138, President Joseph F. Smith illustrates something we can do to keep
our inspiration channels open. President Smith says he sat in his room reading, pondering,
meditating and reflecting upon the scriptures and the Atonement. As he did so, the eyes of his
understanding were opened and he receive a wonderful vision of the Savior&#8217;s visit to the spirit
world.. What a great model. In the noisiness and the busyness of this world, we must find quiet
places to meditate, to reflect, to ponder, to seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost and to keep our
mind and heart open to His promptings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Doctrine and Covenants 88:67&#8211;68, we are promised 
		<i>&#8220;if your eye be single to my glory, your
whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body
which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.&#8221;</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have learned for myself, brothers and sisters, that there is a God and that he loves us and that
through the Holy Ghost he answers our prayers when we are sufficiently humble and meek to
listen. As a young missionary in Central America, I was the leader over the missionaries in a
particular country. We all went on a p-day activity to see the crater of a supposedly extinct
volcano. There were two ways to get down into the crater of the volcano. One was to go down
some steep ledges into the face of the volcano and the other was to walk through a jungle area
around the rim of the volcano and come in on the back side that gently sloped to the crater. Most
of the missionaries took the path through the jungle area. Some of us went down the cliffs. We
met safely at the bottom and enjoyed seeing the volcano, (which, by the way, erupted a couple of
months later). As we prepared to leave, it began to rain. I had not brought my raincoat or
umbrella. I was getting soaked as we walked, and said to the others, I&#8217;m getting sopping wet and
the rest of you have protection, just tell me how to get back through this jungle area, and I will
meet you at the bus. I always tried to be an obedient missionary, and I knew I should always be
with my companion, but out in the middle of the jungle there was no danger of immorality, so it
seemed harmless to go ahead alone. Off I went. I soon came to a little fork in the path, and did
what I thought I had been told to do. I continued for sometime through some very dense jungle
growth. I wondered why the elders and sisters hadn&#8217;t complained about having to go through
this. I could hardly see because the rain was now falling in torrents and my glasses were muddy.
I tried to go faster but soon realized I was lost. I tried to retrace my steps, but I had left no trail. I
began to panic. I ran and pushed through the dense undergrowth. At one point I fell into a big pit
that had been covered over by vines and other growth. I managed to crawl out, but it was very
obvious to me that I was lost in a jungle, I had no idea where I was or how I was ever going to
get out.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Finally I dropped to my knees in the mud and told Heavenly Father I was awfully sorry and that I
really needed His help. In my mind I could see the headlines &#8220;Missionary Lost in the Jungle&#8221; or
&#8220;Other Missionaries Lost Trying to Find Their Leader,&#8221; or &#8220;Mission President in Helicopter
Looking for Lost Missionaries.&#8221; I was absolutely terrified, not only for my own safety, but for
fear that others would come looking for me and be placed in jeopardy themselves. After prayer,
the only thought that came to me was that I should climb a tree and yell. I had been yelling, so
that didn&#8217;t seem like much of a prompting, but I climbed a tree. I remember seeing an orchid on
the limb that I crawled out on, and began yelling as loud as I could yell. I was really discouraged
and frightened. As I recall, there was a brief ray of light that shone through the dark sky and
gave me hope. I yelled louder. I thought I heard something so I yelled again and then I climbed
down out of the tree and continued to yell, to listen and follow in the direction of what I hoped I
was hearing. After what seemed like an eternity, I found my way to the company of two
wonderful missionary companions. They told me they had come looking for me, but that they
were certain that I had not gone the way I had because it was going exactly opposite of the way I
should be going and was heading deeper into the jungle. They told me they had turned around
and started back but felt to go just a little further before turning back. As they did so they heard
my voice and began calling to me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I know through this and many other experiences, some as recent as this week, that God hears and
answers prayers and that the promptings of the Holy Ghost are real. I had been unwise. I hadn&#8217;t
committed a great sin, but I had been disobedient. I assure you, my heart and mind were open
and eager for inspiration.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I plead with you to take full advantage of being here in this unique environment. Learn how
to study and learn and treasure up the light and truth that are taught to you in the course work.
Seek for the promptings of the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost to understand truth and to
increase your faith and to apply it in your life. I plead with you to protect your mind and heart
from the adversary&#8217;s relentless efforts to jam your communication channels by polluting your
mind and heart with bad music, pornography, bad thoughts, pride and any and all of the other
tools he uses so mercilessly. Seek to be a true disciple of Jesus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Each week in sacrament meeting, as the priest pronounces the prayer on the bread and water, he
does so to the benefit of our souls, which includes the governing centers of heart and mind. In
our behalf He recommits us to do three things: first, take upon us the name of the Savior (I
suspect that means we should look and act as His disciple); second to always remember Him,
(that includes when someone cuts us off in heavy traffic, in athletic competitions, or when there
is a chance to cheat on a test or plagiarize for a paper); and third, that we will keep his
commandments. The prayer concludes with a promise that we will always have His spirit to be
with us. The realization of that promise is dependent upon us keeping these three commitments.
If we do not have the companionship of the Holy Ghost to guide us in our lives, in our studies, in
our pursuit of truth, we need look no further than the quality of our own gospel obedience to see
why.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A couple years after his death, the Prophet Joseph appeared to Brigham Young and in part gave
this counsel: <i>&#8220;Tell the people to be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and follow it and it will
lead them just right&#8221;</i> (Joseph Smith, comments expressed in a vision given to Brigham Young in
February 1847. See &#8220;Manuscript History of Brigham Young 1846-47&#8221; (Eldon J. Watson, 1971),
pp. 528-30). That is wonderful and true counsel for us today.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord will keep his promise and the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost will be with and
guide us and it will be the best of times. I close by echoing the words of the Apostle Paul in 2
Corinthians 9:15: <i>&#8220;Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.&#8221;</i></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080" size="2">December 6, 2005</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br /></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Throughout this year I have spent a considerable amount of time studying the life of the Prophet
Joseph Smith.  I chose to do this in-depth study for two reasons.  First, for several years I have
increasingly felt the desire to do so and second, as many of you realize, on December 23<sup>rd</sup>  we
will observe the 200<sup>th</sup>  anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith.  I simply wished to become
increasingly acquainted with the Prophet Joseph and this year seemed an especially timely
occasion to do so.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />From many observations about the life of Joseph Smith that have particular applicability in our
lives, I have chosen five to share with you today.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Adversity, though difficult and painful, is an essential and even elevating part of our
lives. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Joseph Smith experienced adversity beginning in his childhood.  Most of you would be aware of
a life-threatening bone infection and subsequent series of surgeries endured by Joseph as a young
boy.  Even though this early experience with adversity was extraordinarily difficult, it was but a
beginning of what the Prophet Joseph experienced within his 38 year life span. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Certainly from the time of the First Vision forward, Joseph&#8217;s life was seldom free from
adversity.  Vicious verbal abuse was commonplace.  Very real physical threats and dangers
became sufficiently regular that even his being tarred and feathered does not stand out to us
today as starkly as the extraordinary event it truly was.  False arrests and malicious court trials
were numerous and oppressive.  Over the years many Church members, including close
associates and even some members of the Twelve, became embittered for various reasons. 
While some of these disgruntled individuals became only complainers and murmurers, others
became extremely bitter and contentious foes. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, here&#8217;s the point I invite you to consider: even in the midst of these and many other trials
experienced by Joseph Smith, the remarkable unfolding of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus
Christ continued to move steadily forward.  It moved forward essentially unimpeded by this
parallel flow of countering events.  Perhaps, in ways we do not understand, the Restoration was
even strengthened by the trials and tragedies that surrounded it.  For example, reflect on the
reality that during the prolonged and particularly difficult period that Joseph Smith was unjustly
held in the Liberty Jail, he received some of the more profound and comforting revelations ever
given to him.  It is likewise instructive to consider that during this multiple month imprisonment
the Prophet was afforded one of the few periods in his life when he had time to deeply reflect
upon the very events of which he had been a central participant.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Note what Joseph Smith wrote in 1842, as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 127:2: 
		</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small
thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days
of my life; and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless I was ordained from
before the foundation of the world for some good end, or bad, as you may choose
to call it. Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things, whether it be
good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has
become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to
this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver
me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for
the Lord God hath spoken it.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So it should be with each of us.  Adversity is a natural part of our earthly experience (though I
certainly do not include the form of adversity that is the consequence of foolish decisions).  We
should learn to view adversity as something that stretches and strengthens us rather than
something that constrains us.  I commend to you the observation I recently heard voiced by a
stake president in a nearby community.  He said in effect it is not the adversity that comes to us
that holds us down, rather it our resentment for the adversity that holds us down.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">A touching example of Joseph Smith&#8217;s capacity to move forward in the midst of adversity
involves Doctrine and Covenants 128, which was received on September 6, 1842.  From verses
22 and 23 we read the following excerpt:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause?  Go forward and not backward. 
Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!  Let your hearts rejoice, and be
exceedingly glad.  Let the earth break forth into singing. . .</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all the valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and
dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King!</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span style="font-weight: bold">2. The Lord generally uses ordinary people rather than miraculous means to achieve
miraculous outcomes. </span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I&#8217;ll illustrate this point with familiar circumstances involving the gold plates.  As I contemplated
the extensive challenge faced by Joseph Smith to protect the gold plates from the many serious
attempts made by others to get them from him, I wondered why the Lord did not provide a
detailed plan or other means for their protection.  After all, after the loss of the 116 pages, an
angel came and took possession of the plates for a short season.  Why then did not the Lord
make use of heavenly means to transport the plates from place to place rather than give Joseph
the difficult task of providing for their protection?  Although, parenthetically, in the final days of
translation, in a move from Pennsylvania to the home of David Whitmer in New York, the Lord
did instruct Joseph that an angel would be the means of conveying the plates; but this was indeed
an exception to the typical practice.  Why, therefore, was the responsibility for the plates usually
placed upon Joseph Smith?  Did not this difficult obligation serve only to slow up the overall
process of translation?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I submit that the Lord has other concerns in addition to the expediency with which His work
moves forward.  If expediency was the Lord&#8217;s major concern, then it would be reasonable for
Him to regularly provide us with miraculous processes.  Obviously, other considerations are of
equal or greater concern to the Lord.  I am certain that He has great interest in our spiritual
growth.  Thereby, His ends are more fully accomplished when each of us is faithfully struggling
to do His will, using the seemingly simple means open to us.  Our earnest efforts are sufficient to
accomplish the Lord&#8217;s purposes&#8211;even to the degree that at times the results may rightfully be
viewed as  miraculous.  And, in the process of faithfully exerting ourselves, we grow and
develop in ways we could not have done otherwise.  </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Here, may I inject that during the last five years in the transition from Ricks College to BYU-Idaho, we have lived, and continue to live, the reality of this lesson.  This university stands today
as a miracle of heaven that came about through the faithful labors of ordinary people.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">As for Joseph Smith, I have no question that he developed a high degree of reverence and
perseverance toward sacred things because he had been given such difficult responsibilities for
the gold plates.  I have no question that Joseph Smith was able to develop the range of personal
strengths and qualities he came to possess because the Lord placed many weighty
responsibilities upon him.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">These are the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell.  
		<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Looking back today, we are not surprised that Joseph Smith, like any of the best of mankind, still
had faults and failings.  Within his day, however, there were those, too many in fact, who
seemed unable to think of a prophet as but a mortal man.  They were disturbed and offended that
Joseph Smith continued to possess some measure of frailties and inadequacies.  Some, it would
seem, truly thought a prophet should be infallible and invincible.  Others, ostensibly, could
accept the notion that he was not infallible, but, in reality, could not accept his actual failings. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Prophet Joseph&#8217;s weaknesses were not grave. He was not guilty of sin as some enemies of
the Church would insist.  It should be obvious to us that the Lord would not have allowed him to
remain in his calling had he been involved in transgression.  Joseph Smith&#8217;s failings and
shortcomings did not prevent him from doing the work to which he had been called.  He was
able to both move beyond his weaknesses and to serve with great effectiveness in spite of them. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The lesson for us is twofold:  first, we must recognize that those who are called to preside at both
the general and local levels throughout the Church will also have faults and failings.  When we
see evidence of such, we should not become disturbed or distracted.  We should be grateful for
the patience that the Lord daily showers upon each of His children.  Second, we should not doubt
our own ability to serve effectively in whatever callings come to us simply because of our acute
awareness of our own challenges and limitations.  The Lord can and will call us in our
weaknesses and yet magnify us for His purposes.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Consider these additional words from Elder Neal A. Maxwell:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">We have obligations to the Lord&#8217;s prophets, past and present, which include being
fair, posthumously or presently, concerning their words. Should we not
distinguish between the utterances of the moment and considered opinions?  Do
not all of us wish for that same understanding on the part of our friends, hoping
they &#8220;with the breath of kindness&#8221; will &#8220;blow the chaff away&#8221;?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">We are wise to follow, therefore, the example of Lorenzo Snow rather than that of
Thomas B. Marsh. Marsh let himself become so preoccupied with the
imperfections in the Prophet Joseph Smith that he found himself disaffected and
out of the Church for a season. Lorenzo Snow said that he had observed some
imperfections in the Prophet Joseph Smith, but his reaction was that it was
marvelous to see how the Lord could still use Joseph. Seeing this, Elder Lorenzo
Snow&#8212;later President Snow&#8212;concluded that there might even be some hope for
him!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The First Vision was the result of Joseph Smith studying the Bible and then seeking the Lord in
prayer for an answer to his question concerning which church he should join.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Moroni&#8217;s multiple visits to Joseph Smith on September 21st and 22nd in 1823 were the result of
prayerful inquiry. The restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood to Joseph Smith and Oliver
Cowdery in May, 1829, was the result of dedicated study and fervent prayer. The majority of the
revelations which comprise the various sections of the Doctrine and Covenants were received as
the result of specific study and prayerful inquiry.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><br />Let me invite you to take time to review the topical guide section of your scriptures under such
words such as ask, seek, pray, and knock.  In doing so, you will be led to scriptures that clearly
verify that the pattern applied by Joseph Smith is the pattern that the Lord has set forth for each
of us. Many of us, and I include myself, fail to apply these principles of study and prayer to the
degree we should.  On one occasion, in speaking of our opportunity to be led by the spirit,
Brigham Young lamented that &#8220;we live far beneath our privileges.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is a simple yet profound and vital truth: Inspiration and revelation generally flow only as
the result of prayerful study and specific inquiry.  Let us each improve.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Joseph Smith regularly manifested a forgiving nature and befriending posture to those who
persecuted him.  Let me illustrate this with two experiences.  The first is a delightful experience
related by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith.  Mother Smith, as she was affectionately known to
early Church members, compensated with spunk for that which she lacked in height.  Standing
only about four foot, ten inches in height, she possessed levels of courage and energy that were
almost without equal.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">Presently the main body came to a halt. The officers dismounting, eight of them
came into the house. Thinking they had come for some refreshment, I offered
them chairs, but they refused to be seated, and, placing themselves in a line across
the floor, continued standing. I again requested them to sit, but they replied, &#8220;We
do not choose to sit down; we have come here to kill Joe Smith and all the
&#8216;Mormons.&#8217;&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said I, &#8220;what has Joseph Smith done, that you should want to kill him?&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#8220;He has killed seven men in Daviess county,&#8221; replied the foremost, &#8220;and we have
come to kill him, and all his Church.&#8221;</font></p>

<font color="#000080">&#8220;He has not been in Daviess county,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;consequently the report must
be false. Furthermore, if you should see him, you would not want to kill him.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#8220;There is no doubt that the report is perfectly correct,&#8221; rejoined the officer; &#8220;it
came straight to us, and I believe it; and we were sent to kill the Prophet and all
who believe in him, and I'll ... execute my orders.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#8220;Yes, we do,&#8221; returned the officer.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I continued. &#8220;I want you to act the gentleman about it, and do the job

be murdered by inches.&#8221;</font></p>

<font color="#000080">Joseph, just at this moment finished his letter, and, seeing that he was at liberty, I
said, &#8220;Gentlemen, suffer me to make you acquainted with Joseph Smith, the
Prophet.&#8221; They stared at him as if he were a spectre. He smiled, and stepping
towards them, gave each of them his hand, in a manner which convinced them
that he was neither a guilty criminal nor yet a hypocrite.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">Joseph then sat down and explained to them the views, feelings, etc., of the
Church, and what their course had been; besides the treatment which they had
received from their enemies since the first. He also argued, that if any of the
brethren had broken the law, they ought to be tried by the law, before anyone else
was molested. After talking with them some time in this way, he said, &#8220;Mother, I
believe I will go home now&#8212;Emma will be expecting me.&#8221; At this two of the
men sprang to their feet, and declared that he should not go alone, as it would be
unsafe&#8212;that they would go with him, in order to protect him. Accordingly the
three left together, and, during their absence, I overheard the following
conversation among the officers, who remained at the door:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">1st Officer. &#8220;Did you not feel strangely when Smith took you by the hand? I never
felt so in my life.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">2nd Officer. &#8220;I could not move. I would not harm a hair of that man's head for the
whole world.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">3rd Officer. &#8220;This is the last time you will catch me coming to kill Joe Smith, or
the &#8216;Mormons&#8217; either.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">1st Officer. &#8220;I guess this is about my last expedition against this place. I never
saw a more harmless, innocent appearing man than the &#8216;Mormon&#8217; Prophet.&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">2nd Officer. &#8220;That story about his killing them men is all a ... lie&#8212;there is no
doubt of it; and we have had all this trouble for nothing; but they will never fool
me in this way again.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now, I would like to conclude by recounting a more tender experience of Joseph Smith&#8217;s ability
to forgive and to befriend others.  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It involves William W. Phelps, who joined the Church in Kirtland and became a faithful and
loyal member. With the passage of time, however, and as the result of improprieties and pride,
Brother Phelps fell away from the Church.  He eventually became bitter and hostile toward
Joseph Smith. The timing of his hostile feelings was unfortunate as it occurred at the point
Joseph Smith was taken prisoner in Far West, Missouri, during the incredibly turbulent period of
persecutions that took place there in 1838 and 1839. </font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Sadly, Brother Phelps fell to a lower point yet.  He joined other disaffected members in giving
false witness against Joseph Smith in the contrived court trials that eventually resulted in the
Prophet and other leaders being unjustly sent to Liberty Jail. What possibly could have been the
feelings of Joseph Smith in realizing that Brother Phelps, along with others who had once been
his trusted friends, had so totally and so unjustly turned against him?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">Dear Brother Phelps: &#8230;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">You may in some measure realize what my feelings, as well as Elder Rigdon&#8217;s
and Brother Hyrum&#8217;s were, when we read your letter&#8212;truly our hearts were
melted into tenderness and compassion when we ascertained your resolves. &#8230;
		</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">It is true, that we have suffered much in consequence of your behavior&#8212;the cup
of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing
when you turned against us. &#8230; </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we
are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the
hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be
delivered from the powers of the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God&#8217;s
dear children, and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and
by diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our God, and
your God, and to the Church of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be
happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the
returning prodigal. &#8230;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#8220;Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">For friends at first, are friends again at last.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Many of you would not know what subsequently became of William W. Phelps and how Joseph
Smith&#8217;s letter freed him from his burden and allowed him  to return to serving the Church.  As he
returned, he did so with a fervency and with faithfulness that few can equal.  It became his
privilege and blessing to speak at Joseph Smith&#8217;s funeral service.  Eventually, using the skills
that in earlier years had allowed him to write the words to such beloved hymns as &#8220;The Spirit of
God Like a Fire Is Burning&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8217; God the Eternal Father,&#8221;  he composed the words to &#8220;Praise
To The Man.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I testify that extending forgiveness does in fact open doors of great blessings, both to the one
who offers the forgiveness and to the one who receives it. I further testify that as we examine the
lives of those the Lord has called to lead His Kingdom, we will be taught and will be given
additional patterns from which to guide our lives. God is our Eternal Father.  Jesus Christ, His
Son, is our Savior and Redeemer.  Joseph Smith is the chosen Prophet through whom the gospel
was restored.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Kingdom of God here upon
the earth today.  Of these things I testify and do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Character, Competence, and Confidence: Being a Disciple-Leader&#8221;</span></i><br />
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font color="#000080">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font color="#000080">December 16, 2005</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font color="#000080">President Kim B. Clark</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><br />I want to talk today for a few moments about what lies ahead for you and what I hope you take
from your experience here. Brothers and sisters, because we live in the dispensation of the
fullness of times, you will have many wonderful, and many very challenging experiences.  With
that future in mind, we have sought to prepare you to become a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ
and a leader in your families, in the Church, and in the world around you.  Being a disciple and
being a leader is all about exercising your agency to act according to the principles of the gospel. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe there are three principles that will help you realize the great promise in your
discipleship and in your leadership. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Character is the complex of personal attributes that define your capacity to act according to what
is true and right in all circumstances.  Elder Richard G. Scott has taught us that we build
character when we decide and act with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ: <i>Faith will forge strength of
character available to you in times of urgent need.  Such character is not developed in moments
of great challenge or temptation.  That is when it is used.  Character is woven patiently from
threads of principle, doctrine, and obedience</i> (Richard G. Scott, The Sustaining Power of Faith
in Times of Uncertainty and Testing, Ensign, May 2003, p. 75).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Building character is like building a house.  If your house of character is to be strong, you must
build it on the foundation of faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments.  The
Savior used exactly this image in Luke 6:47-48:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew
you to whom he is like:</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation
on a rock; and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,
and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock</i> (Luke 6:47-48).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Like the house built on the rock, we can be firm and unwavering in our commitment to the Lord. 
Christ is the Rock of Israel.  He is our foundation.  If we follow Him and if we &#8220;dig deep&#8221; and
set our &#8220;house of character&#8221; on the Rock of Christ, we will be steadfast and immovable.  To dig
deep means to act with integrity, according to the doctrines of salvation and the principles of the
gospel, time after time after time&#8212;no matter what the temptation or the challenge.  Each time we
dig a little deeper, we establish a character that is more and more like the Savior.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The second principle is competence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me share two quotes from President Hinckley with you.  They capture the essence of this
second principle.  Here is what President Hinckley said at the dedication of the Hinckley
Building:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>You don&#8217;t have to be a genius.  You don&#8217;t have to be a straight-A student.  You
just have to do your very best with all the capability you have.  You have to do
your very best.  And somehow, if you do that, God will open the way before you
and the sun will shine, and your lives will be fruitful and you will accomplish
great good in the world in which you take a part</i> (Dedication of the Gordon B.
Hinckley Building, 22 October 2002, Brigham Young University-Idaho).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Here President Hinckley teaches us that competence in being a disciple-leader comes from three
things:  (1) capability&#8212;this means learning how to act effectively; (2)&#160;doing your very best with
that capability&#8212;nothing halfhearted or in a sloppy way&#8212;your very best; and (3)&#160;receiving the
blessing of God&#8212;if you are faithful and give your best, God will magnify your capability.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">With faith in the Lord and a willingness to do your best, you develop competence in your work
and service.  Indeed, President Hinckley has admonished us to seek excellence in what we do:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>This is the great day of decision for each of us.  For many it is the time of
beginning something that will go on for as long as you live.  I plead with you: 
don&#8217;t be a scrub!  Rise to the high ground of spiritual, mental, and physical
excellence.  You can do it.  You may not be a genius.  You may be lacking in some
skills.  But so many of us can do better than we are now doing.  .&#160;.&#160;.&#160;Don&#8217;t muff
your opportunities.  Be excellent</i> (President Gordon B. Hinckley, The Quest for
Excellence, Ensign, September 1999, p. 2).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The third principle is confidence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The road ahead will not be easy.  There will be things that will test your ability, and your
resolve, and your faith.  If you are to be a disciple-leader, you must develop the confidence to
face those things head on.  Where does that confidence come from?  Let me make it very, very
clear.  It does not come from you.  The confidence you need is confidence in the Lord.  
		</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>But Ammon said unto him:  I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own
wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will
rejoice in my God.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not
boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things;
yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we
will praise his name forever</i>  (Alma 26:11-12).</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.  I give unto men
weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that
humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have
faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them</i> (Ether 12:27).</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">My brothers and sisters, you have access to the powers of heaven. 
		</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So, here is the third piece of practical advice:  Each night when you pray, ask the Lord to help
you not trust in the arm of flesh, but trust in Him.  Ask Him to show you your weaknesses.  Ask
Him for the strength to do what you need to do.  Then, get up off your knees and go to work!  Do
your best.  Act in faith. I bear witness, born of my own experience, that the power of the
Atonement will come into your life. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I bear witness that God our Father loves us; that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer; this is
His church and kingdom restored to the earth through the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
A Prophet of God, whom I honor, and respect, and love, even Gordon B. Hinckley, leads us
today.  Your future is bright and glorious.  May the Lord bless you and keep you all the days of
your life.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>
